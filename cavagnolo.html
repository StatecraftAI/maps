                <p>Public school is the only shot most of us have at a future. From kindergarten to my Ph.D., public
                    education made me who I am. Everybody deserves what I had, but that opportunity is dying in America,
                    so I'm running to do something about it.</p>

                <p>I don't believe in small victories, being satisfied with "the high road," or running errands for the
                    establishment. I'm running because Portland's schools — and America's institutions at large — are
                    under siege by people with the wealth and power to get what they want when they want it. What they
                    want is more for themselves and less for everyone else, and that includes education.</p>

                <p>I am running to champion the needs of the hardworking people in our city who tirelessly labor day in
                    and day out yet remain unacknowledged, overlooked, belittled, marginalized, and silenced. These
                    individuals rise each morning, determined to push through another day of despair. They bear the
                    heavy burden of anxiety and stress inflicted by the economic inequality that those in power have
                    thrust upon us. We demand what they are owed: a quality public education that recognizes and values
                    their contributions.</p>

                <p>Do you want your optimism back? How about a future worth caring about? Are you looking for
                    reassurance that someone is relentlessly and ruthlessly fighting against those who treat education
                    as a luxury for the privileged? If so, I feel the same way, which is why I'm running. If you believe
                    that a 'nice' candidate is the best choice for this job — someone who is a safe bet — then you
                    should vote for them. But if you're fed up and have a can of gasoline, I'm your match.

                So why elect the astrophysicist turned corporate drone with no kids and no experience?
                <ul>
                    <li>I have plans to extract cash from those who stole it from our schools without touching your
                        taxes.</li>
                    <li>I have a deep passion for education and the sciences, which I love more than any other
                        discipline.</li>
                    <li>Education is the foundation of a confident and formidable citizenry.</li>
                    <li>I'm free from the usual baggage, special-interest ties, linear thinking, and a "by the book"
                        attitude that hinders focused, high-impact action.</li>
                    <li>I do not settle for half-measures, "In for a penny, in for a pound," and I
                        am ready to challenge those in power.</li>
                    <li>My life was dedicated to academics until I had to leave in search of a living wage and a
                        long-term career. We can no longer accept a broken system simply because "that's how it is."

                        <h3>Problem 1: Chronic Underfunding</h3>
                        <p>Portland's schools are broke because Oregon's tax system is a scam: Measure 97 defeated,
                            Nike's Sweetheart Deal with Governor Kitzhaber, Single Sales Factor & Intel, Portland
                            Business Alliance Lobbying, and more. Working-class families pay 9% of their income in
                            taxes. The wealthy pay 6%. Corporations like Nike and Intel pay less than a food truck. This
                            isn't an accident — it's theft. We're robbing kids to subsidize billionaires.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <span class="icon solid major fa-solid fa-arrows-left-right-to-line"></span>
                        <h3>Problem 2: Equity & Achievement Gaps</h3>
                        <p>We've turned poverty into a life sentence. If you're born poor in Portland, your school gets
                            fewer books, broken heaters, and a police officer instead of a therapist. That's not equity
                            — that's economic servitude. Telling a Black child in Albina to 'pull themselves up by their
                            bootstraps' while their school lacks textbooks is like telling someone to build a house with
                            no tools. It's cruelty disguised as advice.</p>
                    </section>

                        <h3>Problem 3: Teacher Retention & Compensation</h3>
                        <p>We pay teachers like babysitters and wonder why they quit. Meanwhile, Portland spends $3
                            million yearly on consultants to write reports no one reads — I live this daily. Priorities,
                            people. If we can sit on $1Bn in unused city funds and waste resources ego stroking the
                            vanity of local politicians, we can damn well pay teachers enough to live in the city they serve.</p>

                        <h3>Problem 4: The State-Level Showdown</h3>
                        <p>We will not let state politicians hide behind corporate lobbyists while our schools suffer.
                            We will mobilize in Salem — in person and online — to confront lawmakers who keep tax
                            loopholes open for big businesses like Nike and Intel. Our teams of parents, teachers, and
                            community members will attend hearings to expose deals that harm our classrooms. We will
                            demand the closure of these tax breaks or face community outrage.</p>
