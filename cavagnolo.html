                <h2>Public education is the only shot most of us have at a future, and that's dying in America. I'm a

                <h1>My Platform</h1>
                <h2>Why vote for me?</h2>
                <p>
                    The world isn't fair. In America, there's a clear divide between the haves and the have-nots, and
                    most of us fall into the latter group. I'm tired of hearing about "common sense" and "fairness" from
                    wealthy, powerful people who only want more for themselves and less for everyone
                    else — especially regarding education.<br><br>

                    Public education is underfunded on purpose. State and local governments deliberately keep funding
                    low, treating education like a luxury for the rich instead of a right for all. That ends now. I'm
                    here to attack underfunding, close the achievement & equity gap, increase teacher retention & pay,
                    and make public education a priority that state-level politicians can't ignore. It's time to stop
                    letting the wealthy hold education hostage for their own gain.<br><br>

                    I'm fighting for the people who work hard every day but are still overlooked, marginalized, and
                    silenced. These people carry the weight of economic inequality and need someone to stand up for
                    them. Public education isn't just about superficial test scores and grades — it's about giving every
                    kid the tools to think critically, ask questions, and solve problems. It's about giving them the
                    chance to change their future.<br><br>

                    If you're tired of the same old safe candidates and want someone ready for a streetfight over what's
                    right, if you want a politician who knows we're in a battle for our future and is not afraid to make
                    waves, if you've got an unlit torch, then I'm your match.</p>

                        <h3>Problem — Chronic Underfunding</h3>
                        <h3>Solution — Extract cash from those who stole it from our schools without touching your
                            taxes</h3>
                        <p>Portland's schools are broke because Oregon's tax system is a scam: Measure 97 defeated,
                            Nike's Sweetheart Deal with Governor Kitzhaber, Single Sales Factor & Intel, Portland
                            Business Alliance Lobbying, and more. Working-class families pay 9% of their income in
                            taxes. The wealthy pay 6%. Corporations like Nike and Intel pay less than a food truck. This
                            isn't an accident — it's theft. We're robbing kids to subsidize billionaires. You can't
                            "support schools" while voting against taxing the rich. That's like saying you love forests
                            but hate trees</p>

                        <h3>Problem — Equity & Achievement Gaps</h3>
                        <h3>Solution — Target funding and resources on the classroom and not overhead and capital projects</h3>
                        <p>We've turned poverty into a life sentence. If you're born poor in Portland, your school gets
                            fewer books, broken heaters, and a police officer instead of a therapist. That's not equity
                            — that's economic servitude. Telling a kid in Albina to 'pull themselves up by their
                            bootstraps' while their school lacks textbooks is like telling someone to build a house with
                            no tools. It's cruelty disguised as advice.</p>

                        <h3>Problem — Teacher Retention & Compensation</h3>
                        <h3>Solution — Money. Money. Money.</h3>
                        <p>We pay teachers like babysitters and wonder why they quit. Meanwhile, Portland spends $3
                            million yearly on consultants to write reports no one reads — I live this daily. Priorities,
                            people. If we can sit on $1Bn in unused city funds and waste resources ego stroking the
                            vanity of local politicians, we can damn well pay teachers enough to live in the city they
                            serve.</p>

                        <h3>Problem — The State-Level Showdown</h3>
                        <h3>Solution — Don't just advocate, make noise, become a disturbance.</h3>
                        <p>We will not let state politicians hide behind corporate lobbyists while our schools suffer.
                            We will mobilize in Salem — in person and online — to confront lawmakers who keep tax
                            loopholes open for big businesses like Nike and Intel. Our teams of parents, teachers, and
                            community members will attend hearings to expose deals that harm our classrooms. We will
                            demand the closure of these tax breaks or face community outrage.</p>

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>

                    I grew up in Atlanta and have lived in places like Michigan, Canada, France, and Tennessee, with
                    extended stays in India, Japan, and South Africa. My journey has shaped who I am, but the fight for
                    fairness drives me.<br><br>

                    I pursued <a href="#education">academics</a> as a career and spent years as an <a
                        href="https://www-n.oca.eu/cavagnolo" target="_blank">astrophysicist</a>,
                    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5FViJdoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">publishing
                        research</a> and <a href="#experience">teaching</a>. But in 2011, I made the brutal leap
                    to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kcavagnolo" target="_blank">industry</a> leaving my dream
                    job because there just wasn't a way to make a
                    living doing it. I became politically aware during the 2000 election, a pivotal moment in American
                    history, and my core principles have been the same since:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Solidarity</b>: We may not always agree, but we're in this together, like it or not.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Humility</b>: We're a small part of the world; our actions should reflect that understanding.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Compassion</b>: No one can do everything alone; we must see and hear others in their times of
                        need.</li>
                    <li><b>Honesty</b>: Science teaches us to question everything, as should our leaders. We need to
                        acknowledge when we're wrong and do better.</li>
                </ul>
                These principles guide my vision for education. A good education is not about memorizing facts or
                scoring well on tests. It's about developing a lifelong curiosity, asking "Why?" and "How?" and
                teaching kids how to think, not just what to think. Education is a right for every child, no matter
                where they come from or how much money their family has.
                </p>
