## Usage Notes

1. **For Mapping**: Use with GeoJSON precinct boundaries for spatial analysis
2. **For Analysis**:
   - Filter by `participated_election == True` for Zone 1 election analysis
   - Filter by `complete_record == True` for precincts with both voter and election data
   - Use `participated_election == False` to analyze non-Zone 1 precincts
3. **For Comparisons**: Use county summary records for broader regional context
4. **Missing Data**:
   - `NaN` in election columns = precinct not in Zone 1 election
   - `0` values = precinct was in election but got 0 votes
