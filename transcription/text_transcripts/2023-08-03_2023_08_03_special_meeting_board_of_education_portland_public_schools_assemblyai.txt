A: Let me. Do I need to read the whole script? Yes. Okay. Get back to it. All right, so this. The special meeting of the Board of education for August 3, 2003 is called to order. The item being considered is posted on the PPS website under the board and meeting tabs. The meeting is being streamlined on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28. The purpose of today's meeting is to approve student travel to have a motion and a second to adopt Resolution 6748, authorization for off campus activities. So moved. I can't see who motions or if you can just say your name, that would be great.
