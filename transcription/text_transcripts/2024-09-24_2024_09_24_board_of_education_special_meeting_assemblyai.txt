D: Yeah, absolutely. Chair Wong, I'm pleased that we have come to an agreement with our substitute teachers. Substitute teachers, as you know, as we all know, play a crucial role in maintaining continuity in education and supporting students student learning. And so when our substitute teachers are supported they can significantly contribute to a positive learning environment and help us grow student achievement. The rise in one is the rise in all. I'd like to welcome up Genevieve, our Senior Director of Employment and Labor Relations and PAT President Angela Bonilla. I think I said that wrong. I'm working on rolling and the hells up to share with you what's new in this agreement and what it includes. Thank you for being here.

E: Okay. Good evening Directors and Superintendent Armstrong. We're pleased to bring you tonight a two year agreement between PPS and the Portland Teachers Association. The. The Teachers association represents almost 900 substitutes. I think we have about 906 as of today. These educators are incredibly important to our district. They. As we've stated earlier, they create stability in our classroom when our educators are unable to be there. A few highlights of the changes in the contract we are now or when you ratify, which I Believe you will top of the market with the highest daily rate in the Portland metro area, including Salem and North Clackamas. And our hope is that that attracts as many substitutes as PPs as possible. An opportunity for additional training on classroom management and the curriculum. Quicker time to fill jobs because more jobs will be available earlier to substitutes to see and we've expanded the substitute insurance eligibility. We are so appreciative of our PPS substitute educators commitment to supporting our students and educators and believe that's reflected in the agreement. Yes. Hello.

start time: 74:56:16.000
end time: 97:11:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Good evening, Superintendent Board. We at PAT we're so excited to finalize a substitute contract and that we could come to a settlement so early this year. It's a huge win for our students and our educators. This negotiated move on the salary scale will also be the first independent salary increase for our substitute educators in 22 years. So this marks a huge improvement for our substitute educators quality of life and also ensures that we have quality educators coming to this district to spend time and teach our students when our contract educators are unavailable. I also look forward to all the work that we will continue to do. Once y'all hopefully ratify this contract, we'll be able to free up time and energy to work on some of the shared priorities, including advocating for school funding, working on our school based restorative justice coordinators who have been waiting to settle this contract as new members of pat working on the community and schools and neighborhood schools work and community schools in general. So it has been a privilege to see our substitute educators at the table working together with our PPS HR to certify to finish this contract, settle this contract and hopefully get a ratification for y'all. So thank you for having us.

Do I have a motion and a second to adopt Resolution 6970, 2024-2026 agreement between Portland Associate association of Teachers Substitute Teachers and school district number 1J Multnomah County, Oregon okay, Director Bryn Edwards moves and Director Sullivan seconds. Is there any board discussion?

F: First of all, congratulations. It's great to have it at the beginning of this school year. I know this will be welcome news for all of our students. We love having our regular classroom teachers in front of our students every day. We know there are instances where we need substitute. So it's good news for stability. I think for this year. This is a question. Maybe the superintendent staff is. I'm just curious whether. So I think we have included in this agreement some things that should ensure we have the substitute pool we need. And I'M wondering if it's possible to give us, like, I don't know, halfway through the year, like, trend data. Like, is it. Are there places where we still are needing substitutes or having a hard time filling vacancies? Because it seems like we've, in working with Pat, found some ways that hopefully we should bridge some of those gaps that we have. But it would be good to get that validated. And where do we still have some gaps?

start time: 125:20:40.000
end time: 128:41:04.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Yeah, we're regularly checking how we regularly keep track of how many substitute jobs we have daily and then how many go unfilled. So that is available data just be.

Are there any abstentions? Resolution 6963 is approved by a vote of 7 to 0. Thank you. Next up, we have first reading of policies. Two policies revision 6.1 0.100 P high school credit earned to 9th grade policy prior to 9th grade policy and 4.2 0.02. Sorry, 4.2 0.042 B diploma requirements. Policy. Director Brim Edwards, would you please provide a brief overview?

start time: 158:21:10.000
end time: 220:57:10.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Sure. So both of these, they're modified. Modifications of existing policies came out of the committee with a recommendation for first reading. I'm going to start with the change in diploma policy. There's a staff report that captures it, but essentially the Oregon legislature modified language in a number of the education statutes, including changes to extended and alternative certificates. So the modifications in our policies reflect the change in state law. And I'm just going to quote the staff report on why we should make this change. It's just best practice for district policies to align with state law. So this is. It's not housekeeping. It's a substantial change, but it also ensures that what we state in our diploma policy actually aligns with state law. So that's the. That's the first one. The second policy is ninth grade credit. And this was one that we had substantial discussion about in committee. And the committee recommended that we have a first reading. And as you may recall earlier this summer there was a question about whether courses that students took in middle school would qualify for high school credits. And I'll say just to summarize the discussion and the committee is. We really took. Wanted to accomplish two things, I think with the policy changes. One, we wanted to follow the recommendations of the educators in the district about what should qualify for high school credit. So that's incorporated in the draft policy. The second thing objective was also to make clear to parents so that and students that it wouldn't be like I'm going to take this class. It looks like a high school class, it feels like a high school class, but I don't know whether I'm going to get credit or not. And so in conversations with the staff and I want to thank all the staff who from the Office of Teaching and Learning, I think or who participated in the discussion to provide clarity for families and students. And there is now a place on the website where if you are interested to see if a course at a middle school qualifies for high school credit, you can. You're able to see that information which I think is a. Like I say we followed the educators lead versus substituting the board's judgment for what should count. So we took their recommendation on that. But we're like. And we think parents and students should know before they enroll in the class or what is actually eligible for high school credits versus deciding like which ones were. So I think this version of the policy accomplishes both those goals and hopefully will be a useful resource to middle school parents and also to parents of high school students who are transferring in from other districts because the policy is broader than that. So hopefully we've made the policy more clear and more understandable for families and also followed the recommendations of educators.

start time: 222:34:50.000
end time: 230:47:30.000
confidence: 0.92
H: I just want to make sure. So I unfortunately haven't been able to watch the policy committee meetings on this one. And I'll just say because the red lines, everything's red line. It was hard to tell exactly what the differences are. The staff report notes there was a parent compliance. Am I hearing you? And I don't know. Director Brewer, this is for you or for staff. But the very specific changes from what we had before that we now have a website whereas previously we did not that lists those courses. And the second change is that teachers can decide what classes qualify.

start time: 231:09:10.000
end time: 232:15:42.000
confidence: 0.96
F: No, there's some very and I don't know if you want to come up and share.

start time: 232:17:26.000
end time: 233:27:30.000
confidence: 0.90
H: It doesn't need to be lengthy. But just like in summary, what are the changes in this part? Policy.

start time: 233:41:50.000
end time: 249:15:20.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Yeah, so what was unclear is say if you had gotten credit in a middle school or a private school of whether it counted or not. And we had some very specific recommendations on as you might recall, we had testimony and public comment earlier in the year of a family middle school, families who took a language arts course credit and were said and then surprised that it didn't qualify. So why don't you share sort of the guidelines or the framework that you've created? And you're right. The second thing is now each of the middle schools have gone through and says like, you know, Mandarin or Spanish or math, which are it's usually either language or math that qualifies. But at each school it shows which schools are offering high school level courses in which subjects and that you could then get high school credit for and grades.

start time: 249:39:40.000
end time: 267:13:48.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Good evening. Lorna Fast Buffalo Horse Senior Director of Schools so some of the significant changes, one significant change is that we identified that whatever the superintendent or designee states in district, whatever courses are decided that those will qualify for high school credit, but they must be equivalent to a high school course in terms of personnel, materials, time, facilities, all of those issues. If a student comes from out of district, they must have a high school transcript from an accredited high school in order to transfer that credit in, even if they earned it prior to high school. So we have our internal process that is led by our superintendent. We have an external process that is in accordance with accredited high school credit.

start time: 267:16:44.000
end time: 269:38:00.000
confidence: 0.94
H: And so just you said the superintendent gets or designee gets to decide what qualifies. What was the process, what was the policy before?

start time: 270:12:20.000
end time: 270:44:00.000
confidence: 0.99
G: I don't think it was identified.

start time: 271:51:00.000
end time: 271:57:00.000
confidence: 0.99
D: That.

start time: 271:57:40.000
end time: 284:35:18.000
confidence: 0.95
I: Part of the policy doesn't change all that much. What does change is what happens when a transfer student is trying to bring high school credit that they earned as a middle schooler in another school district. And what what we've done up to this point is to say as long as they've taken one of the classes that we have recognized as a high school credit class for our own middle schoolers, we will transfer the credit. The change is that now we're saying as long as the student has a high school transcript, we will recognize the credit whether that student is an incoming 8th grader or an incoming 11th grader. So that's a shift that we're, we're making in this process.

start time: 284:36:14.000
end time: 286:23:18.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Does that raise the bar for students transferring in then? I mean, it sounds like what you're saying is we used to, if they took a similar class, we'd say, yeah.

start time: 286:23:34.000
end time: 286:34:46.000
confidence: 0.84
C: We'Ll give you credit.

start time: 286:35:18.000
end time: 288:17:58.000
confidence: 0.91
H: Now we're saying, no, you've got to have a high school. And I mean, how would an 8th grader get a high school transcript? They wouldn't, right?

start time: 288:18:54.000
end time: 291:44:22.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Generally speaking, well, they would. Which was the case with the students who came and spoke. They had, through a charter school, gotten a high school credit. So it was from an accredited high school school. Charter high school.

start time: 291:44:46.000
end time: 291:56:22.000
confidence: 0.90
D: But it is, but it is.

start time: 291:56:46.000
end time: 293:45:58.000
confidence: 0.97
H: We in general, this policy change is making it harder for transfers into the district to get credit for things taken before high school.

start time: 293:46:54.000
end time: 300:55:10.000
confidence: 0.97
G: I think it's clarifying. If one of our students who was an eighth grader and earned high school credit transferred to another school district, they would have a high school transcript with that one course on it that they earned in eighth grade. And so we want to have an equivalent, you know, stated process for somebody coming from outside the district into it.

start time: 300:55:50.000
end time: 302:42:22.000
confidence: 0.93
H: So it's normal in districts to give a high school transcript for a child who's not in high school but is taking a high school level class.

start time: 302:44:06.000
end time: 302:55:30.000
confidence: 0.73
G: Yes.

start time: 303:43:50.000
end time: 320:03:32.000
confidence: 0.96
I: We would provide that for our students. What that does mean is if a student comes with a report card from middle school that says that they took algebra, we would ask them to go back to their home school district and say, please, we need a verification from your high school and we trust their school district to have established a similar process that we have in place. That Senior Director Fast Buffalo Horse articulated that for that middle school course to qualify for high school credit, it needs to use high school materials, it needs to have aligned grading practices, it needs to meet high school course standards, etc. That's something that we make sure happens in PPS. Whether student is taking Algebra 1 at Beaumont or at Jackson or another middle school, we make sure that the standards are the same and we trust other school districts to do the same. They verify that they've done that by putting that grade on high school transcript.

start time: 320:05:26.000
end time: 322:00:20.000
confidence: 0.92
H: Great. And then last question, you said you'd had a lot of conversation. Policy committee. Is there anything controversial about this change or anyone who's going to object to it?

start time: 323:08:00.000
end time: 329:20:30.000
confidence: 0.95
G: No, I think it, I think that, you know, there was, as Director Brim Edwards said, there was a real push to clarify what was previously more inconsistent parent communication and clarity. And so, so that has happened. And we think it will be less controversial because it's more clear.

start time: 329:57:30.000
end time: 345:45:40.000
confidence: 0.95
F: And I would direct board members if you're curious. But if you look at the red line or the new version line, I look at the new version in looks like either six or four. There is a link that says approved middle school courses. And if you go to that as a parent, you could just go down and look at what school your student was in and if you were in middle school or K8, and you'd see what courses would qualify for high school credit, which I think is brilliant. And I really appreciate the work that went into that because I know it'll be a resource for parents. We also specifically kept it just a reference to the district website so that as courses change, it can evolve without having to like continuously change the policy.

start time: 346:41:20.000
end time: 350:13:50.000
confidence: 0.93
C: I have a question looking at B. So when we talk about proficiency and we talk about, you know, we're going to do accordance with state law and district guidelines, what did that mean?

start time: 355:40:20.000
end time: 356:45:32.000
confidence: 0.99
I: Can you, can you direct me again to the part of the policy?

start time: 356:48:36.000
end time: 357:12:28.000

C: This is number B.

start time: 357:14:44.000
end time: 357:28:12.000
confidence: 0.99
I: Okay.

start time: 357:30:36.000
end time: 359:12:40.000
confidence: 0.93
C: For just A diploma requirements 4.2 0.042 P.

end time: 360:00:00.000

I: Yeah.

start time: 361:24:20.000
end time: 362:16:40.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm talking about the diploma policy.

start time: 362:21:40.000
end time: 382:31:50.000
confidence: 0.95
I: Okay, let me shift. Let me shift my tabs. Where it says proficiency credit. Proficiency credit will be awarded in accordance with state law and district guidelines. So the state allows for the possibility of students earning credit by demonstrating proficiency as opposed to completing the entire course and having a specific amount of seat time. In other words, the difference between a semester student being enrolled in a course for an entire semester or an entire school year and earning credit by completing specific assignments and passing assessments. The state says school districts have the ability of creating mechanisms that would assess student proficiency levels and determine whether or not to give them credit for that course.

start time: 382:36:50.000
end time: 392:23:30.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Okay, so I have a few questions. So when we talk about that and we look at proficiency scores, that comes back and some of our high schools don't, but they still able to graduate. How are we rectifying those to where folks can graduate even though they're still not proficient? And how. And is that something that we can put in the policy? And maybe this is a question for later or for discussion, but is there a way that those can be aligned somehow? Because I know it's been a conversation before about people being able to. To graduate but not necessarily be proficient in subjects.

start time: 392:39:50.000
end time: 393:32:10.000
confidence: 0.86
I: Yeah, I see. I understand. I understand your question.

start time: 393:58:30.000
end time: 397:45:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Is that raising the standards for our district versus the states, or is that another mechanism to figure out how do we get Our graduates to be proficient and be graduates at the same time.

start time: 398:24:00.000
end time: 408:27:10.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Yeah. I'm not sure the best place to have this is a big, big topic, big conversation. And I think part of maybe what you're asking, and I want to check my understanding, is what happens for a student who, for example, isn't proficient on their 11th grade math OSAs, but they've demonstrated proficiency, have completed three years of high school math, have demonstrated mastery, and therefore can graduate from high school. How do we reconcile them passing their classes, but they're not passing the OSAs? Is that.

start time: 408:42:50.000
end time: 409:09:54.000
confidence: 0.90
C: Yeah, because that's the only mechanism we.

start time: 409:10:02.000
end time: 409:35:46.000
confidence: 0.92
I: Have at the moment at the high school.

start time: 409:38:18.000
end time: 419:38:36.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Because when I, and I've said this before, when I see folks come out of high school and they're giving me their resumes and they're coming from PPS schools, I'm sitting here looking like, I don't, I don't understand how. Because of the comprehension and some of the stuff that we do, I'm like, I'm trying to really rectify how that works. And like I said, we talked about that before. So I just like, and I know we can. The baseline is the state guidelines. Is there appetite for raising those guidelines and that bar for our kids as well. And like I said, maybe it's not a conversation for today, but I hope that at least during that conversation with the policy committee.

start time: 419:39:48.000
end time: 456:16:58.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Well, let me share with you one thing and then refer. You can let me know what would be the best way to continue the conversation. But this year, for most of our core classes at the high school level, the same is true for 6, 8, and the same is true at K5. At this point, let's say language arts, let's say math, let's say science. For every one of those courses, we have a clear set of standards, student learning outcomes. In other words, what do we want students to know and be able to do by the time they finish this course? We've articulated what is the sequence in which those standards should be taught by quarter. We've provided high quality instructional materials. In other words, how can teachers help students achieve those learning outcomes? And we've identified what are the common assessments that teachers should use to assess student learning so that in every algebra class in the district, again, whether it's Jeff or Grant or Ida B. Wells, that those teachers are using common assessments to check on how are students progressing in language arts? Not only do we have common assessments, we also have common rubrics for assessing student work. So there's a lot of effort in place to. I Think do exactly what you're suggesting, which is like clarifying what do we want our young people to know and be able to do, and then some common ways of reflecting on how are they doing and then providing interventions that are needed. Personally, I think that's the direction that we need to go in, rather than having some, like, external. External measures or just relying on external measures. I think external measures are good and important reference points. But I think what we're also saying is that teachers are hungry to come together to talk about their student work, to figure out how to support them more effectively and to raise the bar. So I'm feeling hopeful of what we're doing, I think.

start time: 456:19:14.000
end time: 474:34:50.000

C: So with that. I don't mean to cut you up. So with that, when we talk about. I get. We don't want to just look at the external, you know, numbers and tests and all that stuff. But when we look at internal. And I think I raised this question before. Someone can pass with all these and still graduate, that doesn't necessarily mean they're proficient. You know, so how are we aligning those standards up with our things? Because like I said, when I see kids coming out from this school district here, I'm not all of them. We don't get all of them. But just some. And talk with some of the business community out here. It's a real question around the type of education we're getting. You know, I don't know if I'm articulating it right, but, you know, if you can pass with all Ds, do that really mean you're proficient? And because those are all internal things, whether it's report cards, you know, whether it's assignments. So I just. Maybe I'm just trying to figure out how our policy rectify that if a kid can graduate with all Ds, which doesn't necessarily mean they're proficient, but then we're saying we're giving them this credit and this diploma based on proficiencies.

I: I can keep going. I think what you're asking about are also a great trading practices and the need to align and standardize. And I can tell you right now that we've got some schools and some educators who say D is not good enough. There is no D. There's A, B, C or F. You've met the target, you've exceeded the target, or you need to do it again. And that doesn't mean you didn't get it. And therefore you get a nap. It means this is not good enough. I expect more from you. And I know you can do more. So come see me during flex. Let's redo this. So that's already happening. I can tell you that at the high school level we're exploring what standards based grading practices would look like across the board. Similar work is happening at the middle school level as well. So I'm happy to come back and.

C: Share more about that and I think that'd be something to look at too. You know, when we talk about district wide and we talk about policies, I love that if it's A, B, C or F, I would love if that's something that could be district wide. And that's why I'm thinking like with the policy like this, maybe we raise our standards up to align with what we're trying to trying to get to.

G: And I can offer a much smaller example of how I read that portion of the policy. So currently, if a student is in a dual language immersion program in middle school, their way of assessing their level of language that will then translate to credits is in high school is credit by exam. We have a standardized test that students can take to demonstrate their proficiency. They don't have an identified course, they have the credit by exam. So I think that's what the state is allowing and what this policy is pointing to.

F: Director Hollins, this, as I stated when I introduced it, this was primarily just to conform with changes in state law. I would be open if you and others wanted to look through our policies and have a conversation with the superintendent and staff around what sort of having a proficiency standard would look like. The policy committee would be open to looking at that. But I would suggest that we move so that we're in conformance with state law and then have a follow up conversation. Again, I welcome having that conversation in the policy committee or with the full board if that's something the full board's interested in.

We are scheduled to approve a legislative advocacy agenda on at the October 8th board meeting tonight. We'll have an opportunity to provide feedback on A draft that has been provided to us. So, Superintendent Armstrong, would you like to introduce this?

So here to provide an overview is our senior manager of government relations, Lisa Marek. And as many of you have acknowledged, we need all the support that we can get in making our school safe, welcoming, and equitable for all students. And so we think the draft before you reflects those values. And Lisa will share an overview of our draft legislative agenda. And we hope we can get some feedback from you all before sharing a final draft for adoption next month. Thank you, Lisa.

E: Good evening, Director Wong, Vice Chair Depass and members of the board, and Superintendent Armstrong. I am Lisa Merrick. I'm our senior manager of government relations, here to talk about our 2025 advocacy agenda. So before I dive in, I want to share some key legislative dates as we're looking at preparing for the session. Over the last few months, I have been conducting interviews with staff to get feedback that has really brought a lot of important ideas to the surface that have really informed this ambitious agenda. This week, the legislature is hosting September legislative days, which is when the committees meet informally. We had a staff member, Darcy Soto, present to the committee yesterday on summer learning programs, as we're gearing up to advocate for that this session. The end of the week, Friday, is the pre session legislative request deadline. So that is when legislators can request bills and those bill drafts will be returned to them in December on the floor. So that's kind of when we'll get a first sense of what bills will be up this for discussion this session. November 5th is the general election. So we're also going to see some changes in our city government, in the county and the state legislature as well. And then there's a couple more legislative filing deadlines, which are other additional opportunities for people to submit ideas for bills. So we'll really know by, you know, early to mid January ahead of the session, what concepts are out there and what we'll need to weigh in on and support this session. And then the legislative session will convene on January 21, and they are constant, constitutionally obligated to adjourn by June 28, 2020. So just a preview of the legislative session over the interim, the governor and legislature have held a number of task forces and work groups that are discussing several different concepts. There's an education accountability workgroup, a Statewide educator salary task force, a summer and after school learning work group, a Medicaid advisory group, a chronic absenteeism work group, and then a disqualifying crimes work group. So we'll be expecting bills and policy recommendations out of those groups that we will want to review and offer feedback on. The governor also announced some changes to the current service level. In the past, that CSL calculation was based on a 5050 split, which means there was no assumption of inflation during the biennium. Now that has changed. And so we're looking at a 4,951 split of the state school fund, and that's going to bring in an estimated $217 million more dollars to the CSL calculation. They also announced updating the state's compensation model of how they measure administrator, teacher and classified staff salaries. Instead of looking at a 20 year lookback of those salaries, they're looking at a 10 year look back. And so that's going to potentially bring in $240 million. And then they updated the most current local revenue forecast to include in the current service level calculation. In the past, the state hadn't accurately calculated for fluctuations in local property taxes in the second year of the biennium. So that is anticipated to bring in $55 million.

F: Yeah.

start time: 621:30:50.000
end time: 623:33:38.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So the combination of those numbers, is that the number the governor was talking about to the current service level, that additional 500 and some million dollars?

start time: 623:35:14.000
end time: 758:57:34.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yes. So it's anticipated to bring in a total of about $515 million, which we're looking at likely a roughly $11.3 billion CSL number. And that will officially be announced in late December, early January. And then in addition to that, there's some general legislative priorities that we're expecting to be brought forward this session. The state's looking at bringing a pretty big transportation package forward. They're just wrapping up work groups and town halls that they've been holding across the state. We're also anticipating behavioral health and housing and homelessness packages to be a significant part of the session. And then I wanted to just bring in one more slide before I dive into our actual priorities. I had the pleasure of talking to a lot of staff that informed this agenda. And so I wanted to just uplift some of the key themes that staff raised. Many people I talked to talked about how the lack of stable funding makes it really difficult to meet the needs of our students. Our students have more and more complex needs and we don't have the resources to meet those. It's also really difficult when we don't know how much funding is going to be available. And when we're looking at planning for summer learning, for example, the legislature doesn't pass that until the spring. We don't always know how much funding is available, but staff really need to be planning for that programming now. The unfunded mandates that the legislature has passed have really put a burden on our resources. Resources. It's just stretched existing staff. It's required a lot more of teachers and district staff to adapt to new initiatives that pass without any attached resources to them. It also often requires us to take away funding from other priorities to meet the needs of these new initiatives. I've heard a lot about the inadequate funding model for special education and how much support our special education students really need. The costs have really gone up, but the funding we get from the state has not kept pace with the student needs that we're seeing today. Our aging facilities are at further risk due to climate change. We're experiencing more and more extreme weather events, which we're experiencing in real time like today. And we already have facilities issues that are just getting further exacerbated. And then the absence of the statewide vision and roadmap for student success also makes it challenging for teachers and staff. We constantly have new initiatives that get passed, but they're not necessarily tied to broader goals or comprehensive vision for our students. And so it's really important that our state, as we talk about accountability, they figure out how we provide some really critical values to students and, you know, some goals for students, and we tie any initiatives to those goals and provide school districts with the resources needed to meet those. So now we will move on to our advocacy priorities. And one thing I want to preface this with is this is really a framework. I got a lot of feedback from staff, and I think we have a really good direction that this agenda helps provide. But because of how early we are in the lead up to the session, we don't know all of the bills that will be out in the universe. And so we'll want to make sure that we're responding and that we have an agenda that allows us to adapt and respond as we have more information of what population policies will be out there in addition to, you know, the results of elections. So we just want to be prepared to be able to be responsive to that. So this is a framework. We'll adapt communications materials closer to session. We can put together one pagers with specific bill numbers. We can provide more specific information about the policies. But for now, this is really, you know, a framework of our Values and this agenda has local, federal and state level priorities. So at the local level we're calling on just working with our local municipalities and organizations to advance PPS's literacy campaign to support efforts to reduce gun violence, combat the synthetic opioid crisis and increase community safety in Portland. We want to support the county in expanding early learning programs so that we can really support our students as they enter into our K12 system. Strengthen partnerships with the county to provide consistent behavioral health services to students. Increase resources so that we can make sure that students have safe routes to and from schools and strengthen inter governmental collaboration to support schools and enroll school age children who are not enrolled or attending school, including disadvantaged populations such as homeless, foster and newcomer students. And our federal priorities are aligned with the Council of Great City Schools priorities. We're calling on the federal government to fully fund idea to increase the spending for special education to meet the 40% financial commitment increase connectivity funding to provide students and teachers with access to devices and Internet services Protect and increase appropriations to Title 1, Title II, Title 3 funds which have been at risk in this administration Provide funding for school districts and ESDs to address substance abuse and recovery support services services for students Protect and support our immigrant students and families by supporting a permanent legal protections and a pathway to citizenship for our undocumented students and investing in our school infrastructure to increase financial support for school facilities and greening projects as well as funding to meet mental health needs of our students, staff and teachers by really increasing the number of school psychologists social workers at our schools. And then we have our state priorities. As we gear up for the 2025 session, we are calling on the state to really fund a state school fund that meets our students needs. We know that our students have more complex needs and we want to make sure that the state is allocating enough funding to really support school school districts in supporting our students. We want to guarantee secure and sustainable funding especially to programs like our community eligibility provision which enables us to offer free school meals to all students. Sustainable funding for the Early Literacy Success initiative and investments in extended learning opportunities like summer learning and after school program which was not fully funded last session. And we want to make sure that there's enough for that to be operational statewide. We also really want to push on the state to fully fund special education services and we're already working in a really broad coalition to start discussing a broader policy package for that. And I think one other area is to streamline the grant distribution process. A lot of the new funds that have been passed through the legislature recently have pretty strict reporting requirements. They're competitive grants and it makes it harder for us to always get that funding. And then we have to go through a lot of administrative burdens to access that funding. So when we can, we really want to push on the state to provide that funding by a formula so that all schools districts can access it. Yes. Director Hollins, question.

start time: 758:59:02.000
end time: 770:24:56.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So when we talk about, you know, fund allocation to meet our needs, are we getting together with the other district to actually let them know exactly what we need? Because I know it was a big argument last year around current service level and then what we actually need. So are we getting those numbers together to say, hey, this, this is what we need, not just the current service level needs and making sure that's clear. So if we say we need $12.5 billion or $15 billion, then we're asking for that need. Are we going to be getting those numbers so we can actually tell them this is what we need, not just the current service level amounts?

start time: 770:26:48.000

D: I'd love to answer that. I happen to be on three work groups. The first is the large district work group where you have the 10 largest districts in Oregon. The other one is a COSA off the record meeting for all SUPs in the state. And then another one is a regional with Multnomah county and some other peers. And so we have been talking about some of those investments that we're urging. And so that's reflected in this presentation. And that's just some of the spaces that I occupy. I also know that Lisa Marek and Deborah Cuffouri are out and about and we do want to be aligned. I did hear from superintendents, some superintendents last spring that they felt a little blindsided. I don't know what specific thing, but there may be one or two things that I think maybe we hadn't asked for or that we lobbied for and they didn't know. And so it had some impacts to them. And so one of the things that we've talked about is making sure that we're in alignment and that we're in support. Also, though, that there are some Portland specific things that we're not going to be like in all things, but we do want to be in communication so that there's no surprises to our peers. And the expectation is that it's the same on their end too, that there's no surprises to to Portland.

E: So if you want to skip ahead, that's fine too. I think the only other key K12 investments which are PPS specific ones. Although I think we will be able to build a coalition and get support from other districts. The facilities improvements. We're still in conversation with the statewide association about how to structure that policy. Ask so we may have some asks beyond what our associations ask for. We want to ask for modern school curriculum investments in electrifying school bus fleets and improving school bus safety. The legislature passed a bill last session to allow school districts to have stop arm cameras on school buses, but there was no funding attached to that. So we would like funding for that. Funding for green schoolyards, ensuring safety and security from cyber threats and then improving students access to health care. And we have a few legislative specific priorities. This is really around the statewide accountability system as we know that there will be a legislative concept around accountability. We really want to make sure that it's clear clear that accountability goes both ways. School districts should be held accountable, but the state should also be held accountable. And so we really want to make sure that like I was discussing earlier, that the state does have a long term plan and roadmap for student success and that we're also ensuring that we're improving accountability around our high school graduates and that we have specific skills that we're measuring so that we can truly understand how our high school students are performing, improving student engagement, attendance, strengthening teacher and school leader pipelines, and then working towards a quality and future ready statewide education system which includes supporting the changes to modernize the quality education model so that that can be a more relevant and quality metric. The current QEM does not include the cost of capital needs, lengthening the school year, early education access, or supporting students who live below the poverty line. So those are really important items we want to include in that measure. And then there'll be technical fixes of recently passed legislation that we'll be pushing for and one of those bills will be the one we brought back last or brought forward last session to increase or remove the statutory cap on local option levy collections. I do have one quick slide and this is just kind of a preview. But we will plan on setting up some opportunities for the board to advocate this session. We're working on some communications materials and advocacy toolkit for parents to access and then just structuring sometimes throughout session to have regular calls with our delegation. Then specific lobby days around policies that we'll be bringing forward as well as our student day of action. So I will be following up with specific dates for those. But I wanted to make sure you were aware so that we can get you down to Salem advocating for these really important investments.

F: Just a number of comments. It would be great to get the short list of priorities so that like, what are our top four items so that we. Hopefully before February. So like in the next couple months before. Because once people go down to Salem, it's awfully hard to get mind space often with legislators. So getting just like our. Which I think we should know what they are now and so we could articulate them on the state priorities. It seems like we should be really specific with the number because I think that was part of what happened last time is that it's like we settled on a number that wasn't. It was better than what they had, but it wasn't enough. And then it became, well, that's what you asked for. So I think it would be like, you know, what. What is our ideal number so that we can actually state it and then how it gets rolled up into the state number. Also, it seems. I'm curious about. Is there a reason why we don't specifically call out the governor's proposal?

confidence: 0.95
E: Thank you, Director Bermendwartz. Yes. The intention of our state School Fund Ask is to support the governor's CSL with these additive investments. And so we're working on calculating what the cost would be for these other supports that will calculate into our needed service level. And we are working with other districts to align that number so that we're using the same metrics of calculating that.

H: I guess my question is why. I mean, it's great if the Governor's gonna add $500 million to CSL this year so he can Correct my numbers if I'm wrong, but CSL is going to leave us with tens of millions of dollars of cuts in the next budget. And one of the things that we had talked about with our community, everybody, and, you know, we said, hey, look, you know, we're going to have these cuts. We've got the structural deficit now because of some of the, you know, contract negotiations and other things. And everyone said, okay, okay, yeah, we understand that. But, man, we're going to lobby the legislature hard so we don't have to take those cuts. But we don't say that in here at all. And so I guess I'm curious. I mean, I assume that our legislative priority for funding would be quality education. Model's the floor, and that everything else should be above that. And so I'm afraid we're already into this dynamic where the governor is putting $500 million on the table. Again, current service level means tens of millions of cuts for Portland Public Schools. And they're going to pat themselves on the back and say, look what we did while we slashed teachers and increased class sizes and slash needed services, and our students struggle. So I'm just. I'm curious from your perspective why we aren't saying qem. And I'm going to reiterate with Director Brim Edwards said, but be a little stronger about it. Our local congressional delegation completely misrepresented our ask last time around for their own political benefit. It was one of the most brazen political acts I have ever seen in my life. And I promised at that time that I would never let them get away with it again. And I will just tell you, as long as I'm on this board, I will never let them get away with it again. So we need to ask very explicitly for the exact number we need, whether we're going to get there or not, so that they can never come back and say, well, you know, you asked for something less.

start time: 926:52:30.000
end time: 950:09:30.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yeah, I think that's great feedback. And we will make the appropriate adjustments because we want to make sure that our priorities are representative of all of our thoughts and our feedback. And then one thing I'll add in one of the COSA groups we talked about, one of their number one bullets is unfunded mandates. And so one of the examples I'll use is the unemployment that we have to budget for. So currently we have 5.5 million budgeted for from last summer, winter break, and then this upcoming summer, and that's an unfunded mandate. It was clear that when that came through, there wasn't this thought that districts would, especially our size and with our budget, would have have to in our number of staff would have to set aside, you know, $5 million. And so if something like that is funded, right. I mean, I'm not saying it's going to get to our high numbers of 15, 20 million, but even addressing some of the unfunded mandates would allow us to be able to recoup some of that cost. So if that mandate was fully funded, that would be 5.5 million that we wouldn't have had to set aside this year to cover unemployment costs. And so we're leaning into the unfunded conversation, too. And I also think that we can elevate the current service level and represent that as well.

start time: 950:38:30.000
end time: 965:04:10.000
confidence: 0.97
F: I just think we just roll all that up. I mean, because if we make them two separate things, or is it just a generic category like unfunded management? So school boards have been talking about unfunded mandates for decades. So we need to be really specific of like, here's what you've given us and here's our overall number that we need, whether it's the QEM and then here's the unfunded mandates you gave us, but it should be really specific. And I think it's fine to have it be a big number because it will only go down. It won't go up. So whatever number we set, it's unlikely that the legislature is going to say we're going to give you more than that. And so then they can talk about what gap they left us with.

B: Good evening, board members. DEBORAH Cafori, Chief of staff I just want to set the stage here with some reality check, however, that we are trying to get the number. And this has been a conversation between Portland Public Schools and the Oregon Legislature since my time, which started in 1999. So this has been a constant stream, and part of it is due to time when we get information, when they get information. But I just want to be clear that we will most likely not have that number that you're looking for by the October 8th time that we are going to be voting on our legislative agenda. And we don't want to come out with something too early and be wrong, which has been the case in the past. We really want to be strong on that, and I'm happy to have myoung come up and talk more about why, if you're interested. But just to be clear that we probably won't have that number by the time you vote on October 8th, but that is our goal, to get a strong number and to use all the strategies and tactics that you're talking about to ensure that we get as much money as possible that we deserve for our children out of the Oregon legislature.

B: Oh no, we'll have it before February, definitely. I don't have. I'll have a better idea by October 8th what that timeline will look like by the time.

D: Just a note, I sort of pushed the team on the October 8th date because we do we only have this one time to just by our calendar to get it forth and all of the districts. Our agreement was that by October we would have our legislative priority before the board and voted on. And so we really want to keep to that October date so we can be alongside our peers and some of the advocacy that needs to happen. So maybe that's something that we can update later. But I, I don't want to move the date if at all possible to keep it October 8th.

E: And I'll also add that we're also working with the Oregon Department of Education to estimate the SPED investments. They're looking at what it would cost to increase the cap on special education funding to fully fund regional inclusive services, early intervention services and the high cost disability account. I don't want to give out a number yet, but it is close to a billion likely in that upper hundred million dollar range. So I think that will be another number that will be put out there by a SPED coalition and that would bring significant investments to the district as well.

F: So also had a question I know a couple sessions ago, the technical fix on the statutory cap and the local option, while it's not a statewide priority, it certainly was a priority and I know because of the shifting nature of property taxes, less so. But is that a priority? Because like nobody else is going to. There'll be a lot of people talking about school funding, but nobody probably else is really going to be talking about this other issue. Do we need it? Is that like got it be our number one specific PPS issue because we're the ones who only could deliver it or is it less important?

start time: 1021:30:28.000
end time: 1031:21:26.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Now this session, this is another policy we're monitoring. So you know, I know last when we passed the levy, we were not projected to hit the limit on our statutory cap. However, with the city's urban renewal district, the TIF district proposal, it might impact compression on our local option levy. So it is something that we are monitoring. So we've asked for a placeholder bill. But we're still working with our team to analyze the impacts. But we I think want to make sure that we have that as an option in our back pocket.

start time: 1031:24:38.000
end time: 1040:53:14.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So in my other life, the city presented the TIF districts that they were wouldn't have any impact on local options or bonds is it and that our state school fund would be backfilled. I mean they presented there like there's because of laws that have changed that the TIF districts, unlike they used to have a pretty big impact on local school districts. But they said that they've been carved out is how. How is it that you're saying that TIF districts would.

start time: 1040:56:02.000
end time: 1043:41:50.000
confidence: 0.99
E: We're still working with the city to determine that for sure, but we just wanted to make sure that we have an option as we get more information about their proposal.

start time: 1044:02:10.000
end time: 1045:59:10.000
confidence: 0.98
F: So for the life of this local option, we don't need a increase in the cap because of the decline in the receipts?

start time: 1046:14:10.000
end time: 1046:37:46.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yes, that is still correct.

start time: 1046:38:18.000
end time: 1057:54:50.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Okay, so this is like a lower priority or longer term priority. Okay. I also had just this is. I don't need it tonight, but just more specificity about what on some of the local priorities. Because I don't if we're talking to city and county or people like what what what does this mean? So it'd be useful just to get is it a specific budget that needs to be increased? Is it a like say the reduce gun violence? Is that the city funding gun violence interrupters or what. What is it? So just it's too generic for me to understand what it is that I'd be asking people to support.

start time: 1058:33:10.000
end time: 1072:15:30.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Yes, I'm happy to follow up with more specific details. I think we're still kind of in a preliminary phase of coordinating with the county and city, especially as we're going to have some new leaders after the election. So we've begun having conversations. But a lot of these are still early priorities and we want to make sure that we're able to advocate for these after the election primarily. But I think some of these will be specific budget asks, but also policies that the city or county may introduce that we could support or partnerships that we can have to advocate for funding from the state or federal government together because I think there's a lot of shared goals and priorities to support our students and communities. And there's definitely ways we can strengthen that partnership.

F: Thanks. And then my last items that there's The Establish a 21st century statewide accountability system and that one of the bullets is improving accountability of high school graduates. And this Is this a little bit to what Director Hollins was discussing? But it seemed like last session or the session before when there was a discussion about essential skills, PPS took a pass, which you can debate whether essential skills was the right. Like, we know that they're leaving with the essential skills, but we didn't take a position. And I didn't really agree with us taking a pass because it seems like Director Holland's point, like when you leave pps, we want people to know like they met a certain standard or they're able to do, you know, they, they're able to do high school, you know, proficient in high school work. And so I'd be really interested in what we're doing in that space because like I say, it seems like last time PPS took a pass.

start time: 1088:50:20.000
end time: 1099:35:20.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, that's a great question. We are not taking in a pass this time. We'll be weighing in on that conversation. We're still waiting for the Accountability Work group to provide their proposal. So that will kind of be the framework that will be used and we'll provide feedback on. But I think what I've heard from staff and from board directors and the community is that we really do want to know that our students are ready for their post secondary options and we need to take a position. So we will be prepared to do so and we'll keep you informed as we have more information about that policy once it's presented.

end time: 1113:17:34.000
confidence: 0.95
E: That's a great question, Director Sullivan. And that's the number that Deborah Cuffouri was mentioning. We're working on a calculation to understand how the CSL is going to impact our budget next year. But that CSL is for the biennium, so it will be for next school year and the following one. So we'll be giving you information about how much more money that's projected to bring to PPS as soon as we have it.

confidence: 0.96
D: Well, absolutely. I think if there's a few of these things, I wonder if maybe when we bring this back, the ones that have direct costs that would lower what it is that we spend could be helpful. Because, you know, that is what I was saying about the unfunded mandates, like highlighting unemployment. If that's fully covered, that helps us. If we're able to fully fund special education or even increase the rate in which we're funded at that helps us. So there's a lot of things embedded in here that would significantly improve our situation and perhaps get us to a place where there aren't reductions. And so it might be nice to highlight those items so they see where the financial pieces are in that.

F: Just a reminder, actually, I have one last question. Are we for a statewide cell phone policy? I mean, I'm sure we'll be ask. I mean I'm assuming we'll have a district one, but I'm just.

start time: 1134:35:10.000
end time: 1146:57:30.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Yes, thank you. Great. Good question. It's definitely going to come up. I have not seen the official bill language, but I think there's two to three legislators that are potentially introducing different priorities and different, different bills. Potentially a bell to bell ban is one I've heard out there. And then another one could be just that a district has to pass a policy. We, it's not on our agenda now, but I think the framework we have does give us leeway. If we wanted to weigh in on that. I think we're also seeing what happens at the school board level and if that if a statewide priority would align with where we are at as a district.

start time: 1147:41:20.000
end time: 1163:10:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Just my two cents, because it looks like probably one will move is that it seems like the place in which we avoid unfunded mandates or things that don't work because they're actually, you know, created for A district of 1500 students or 2,500 students versus 40,000 students is to do what they do, they did with every, every student is welcome. Where we expect districts to pass some sort of policy that, you know, meets these general guidelines and then we had a lot of local, more local control which seems better than them. Again, I'm just afraid if you have a district with one high school saying this is what the bill should look like, which doesn't work at all in pbs. So I would hope we advocate for that early on.

start time: 1163:18:30.000
end time: 1169:44:20.000
confidence: 0.98
E: Yeah, I think that feedback is really helpful and we definitely want to make sure that there's no more unfunded mandates as we're securing funding for initiatives that recently passed and did not get funded. So that will be definitely central to our advocacy. And I think to your point, just making sure that districts have that local autonomy to implement a policy that will work for them.
