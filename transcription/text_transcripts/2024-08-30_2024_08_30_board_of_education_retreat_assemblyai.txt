A: Started signing earlier than that. Good morning, board member, superintendent, chief of staff, I want to welcome you today to today's board retreat. Although we've been serving together for that for one year with all of you, this is the first time all seven of us along with our new superintendent will be in a retreat together. We're happy to be at Warner Pacific University. So thank you for hosting us. Dr. Armstrong, do you have any. You want to start off by saying a few words about why we're here today?

C: Well, I just want to acknowledge that Warner Pacific University has provided the space and all of the food and beverages complimentary. And I have the pleasure of serving as a trustee on the board for Warner Pacific. We of a board member who is an alumni of the university. It's important to note that Warner Pacific University, small private university, is the only Hispanic serving institution with a designation of Hispanic serving institution in the city of Portland. And I think is working on another designation. There might be another one with minority serving, but so they're doing. They're doing some great work in the city of Portland and beyond, but they're in our home district. And so how great is it to be able to spend time at a site that serves our kiddos after they leave our schools?

A: Great. Awesome. Before I introduce our facilitators, just want to share a few words about why we're here today. As you know, I'm very proud to be part of this board. I'm really happy that all of you are to be serving with all of you and. And the immense focus that we have on student outcomes, I think that's very unique and that's very. Just proud of being part of all this. And, and the purpose of this retreat today is to kind of. The overarching purpose is to improve our performance. Right. How we work together and a greater understanding of, you know, how our working cells and how to best work together. You know, the, the tone of collaboration and communication kind of starts with us and we have a really huge impact on the district. So today's focus and our purpose as board members is to improve it. Try to start improving and talking about how we can better govern ourselves and make sure that we have a share understanding of what that I think it's also important to know to delineate and important to know what's board work and what's the superintendent's work. That's also a topic discussion today. And also having been on the board for a year now, I am really confident and really happy again that the outcome of this is to include student outcome. So a little bit about Dr. Jenkins Dr. Barbara Jenkins, again, thank you for traveling all this way to be here. I know this is the the long weekend and it's hard to pull people away, but Dr. Jenkins has been serving students for over 30 years. In 2012, she was named Superintendent of Orange county public schools, the eighth largest district in the nation, which is just about 206,000 students. She retired from Orange County Public Schools in December 2022. Dr. Jenkins is a highly recognized education leader, received a Presidential appointment as a Director of the National Board of Educational education sciences in 2017 and received the Baldridge Baldrige Foundation Award for Leadership Excellence in 2022. She has served as Chairman of the Board for the Council of Great City Schools representing the nation's large Urban representing the nation's large urban districts. Dr. Jenkins is a Chief in Residence and the Leader of the Women in Leadership Initiative of Chiefs for Change, a national bipartisan group of district and state education leaders dedicated to the success of our nation's youth. Jenkins also serves on the Board of Trustees for ets, the world's largest private nonprofit education testing and assessment organization. A little bit about Dr. James McIntyre, Jr. Dr. McIntyre is the dean of Colleges of Education and Assistant Provost for Academic Excellence. Prior to his appointment as Dean, he served as Director of the center for Educational Leadership and Assistant professor of Practice at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. In his role, Dr. McIntyre managed the university's Leadership Academy for aspiring school principals, facilitated the Tennessee Rural Principals Network, and provided targeted support and leadership coaching to schools and districts across Tennessee and around the country.

He has also been honored with the Life Achievement Award from the National PT and the Excellence in Educational Leadership Award from the University Council for Educational Administration. With that done, shall we. Let's go around the room and introduce ourselves.

B: So I'm going to make you introduce yourselves when we do the icebreaker. So I'm going to save about two minutes here. Right. Consolidating. Let me. And thank you so much for the kind introduction. Let me just say a couple of words about our purpose to foster the strong governance relationship that guides and supports district leadership and certainly ends in student outcomes that are positive. Is our purpose today. Can we accomplish everything we put on an agenda? Perhaps not. But we can certainly lay a foundation for you to work in that direction. This whole notion of governance and the appropriate role of school boards is pretty critical. There's research around it, there are publications around this notion of coherence. So much so that I put it on a flip chart. In fact, Roseanne, if you stick that chart right over here to cover up the WI Fi sign, that'd be perfect. No, we're not going to. I was going to say when someone comes late, they don't get access to the WI Fi, but we'll leave that uncovered for him. So I want to make sure we have a grounding around this notion of coherence because that's what the research is around. In the book the Governance Core, there's discussion around both alignment and coherence. So think of alignment as we got everything straight. We have our budget aligned with our goals. It's technical, it's the rational side of it. Think of coherence is leaning a little bit more toward the emotional side. It's a commitment to work together for this common good which we like to call a moral imperative. I looked at your website. I've read all of your background's information about you, so impressive for the service that you do here. The moral imperative is really what you put in your own purpose statement that you're going to do something really significant. We provide rigorous, high quality academic learning experiences that are inclusive and joyful. We disrupt racial inequities to create vibrant environments for every student to demonstrate excellence. That's a pretty serious purpose moral imperative which draws us together around this notion of coherence. We want to get things accomplished because we have this moral imperative. And so coherence. Can you see it? Just a couple of words, information I really want us to be able to refer back to the systematic logical connection or consistency. Got a moral imperative we are passionate about. It tugs on the emotions a little bit. It gives us an opportunity to integrate diverse elements, relationships and or values. So because of this moral imperative, we Make a conscious decision that we're going to have coherence. And that coherence is what essentially differentiates boards who have positive student outcomes and those who don't. Want to have a commitment to good governance and understanding and a commitment toward this movement toward coherence from the governing body, from the superintendent and her staff, coherence working together for this common good. And so that's kind of why we're going to spend some time together here today. Let's talk about our agenda briefly. You've seen it. I should apologize, too, because sometimes we send the PowerPoint deck ahead of time, sometimes we don't. I promise you there was no homework assignment other than True Colors. But if you looked it over, it's harmless. If you didn't look it over, it's harmless as well. It's just going to give us a guidance for our discussion today. Want to make sure folks are clear on that. Torn between sending it out ahead of time and not. Because I hate to create additional concerns. Nonetheless, our agenda will run pretty swiftly through some of the activities. And when we get toward the end 11:45, we will break for lunch. We will judge whether or not we actually need a break around 10:45, because I don't want you to sit too long. But I promise you, as we engage in discussing, we will use some strategies. Those who've been in the classroom before will recognize it. Pair and share. Talk to your neighbor about something and then report out. Standing meetings, it means you've got to stand up because you're tired of sitting down. You have a brief standing meeting, and we have a couple of instances where we'll do speed dating rounds, which means you have to talk to more than one person as the time goes by to answer some questions and discuss them. So we'll try to keep you engaged. This is essentially our agenda when we get to the end of the day. The general protocols portion, you don't need much direction from us on. We'll talk some general good practices, but around the strategic plan. Superintendent's going to chime in around superintendent evaluation. Board chair will chime in school board evaluation, give you some ideas. And certainly you can all chime in on that as well. How do boards evaluate and assess their own behavior, their own processes and accomplishments? And then at the end of the day, we'll talk about pluses and deltas and your next steps. All right, here comes the intro. I'm sorry. Norms need you to fully engage, listen and seek to understand, focus on what's best for our students. Assume good intentions. Be both candid and kind. Self regulate your airtime so all get to participate. If these norms, which we typically use are agreeable, I just need a nod from you. Or if there's something else that's missing, tell me now. Good norms, anything missing? You see a nod or something?

B: Thank you. All right, so here come the. Here come the intro. So in three or four sentences, you're going to tell us why you got in this predicament. What drew you to serving in the K12 arena? Three or four sentences. I'm going to give you a couple of seconds because it can't be a paragraph, can't be a run. On sentence, three or four sentences, you have to say to us, why? What made you jump into this job of helping run public education? Let me give you an example. I'll read mine first. I've done it too many times. And when Jim comes on at 10, we'll make sure to ask him to give his as well. So here's mine. I've always wanted to be a teacher. Since a wonderful first grade teacher, Octavia Gignyard, introduced me to the joys of learning. I was repeatedly enticed to pursue higher levels in K12 education in order to impact more students. I genuinely believe. This is my third sentence. I genuinely believe that public education is a lynchpin to our democracy and the only means by which some children, many children, will achieve a different life than their parents had and experience the American dream at a higher level. So they can be compound sentences, just not run on. All right, you need a minute. Need a minute to think of your three to four sentences. I'm going to give you two minutes. Some folks already wrote it down because they saw the slides ahead of time. Why I got into this K12 predicament. I say predicament fondly. There's no place I'd rather be.

I think the schools are a Place where it is possible to make a difference in children's lives. And I had the time and support of my family around middle school.

In my adult career and I've been an educator since my goal for my entire working career. And one of the greatest joys that, you know, I think is when you help guide a student to find success in an area that they never expected to find success. And I think if everyone could have that experience, we would have a better look.

F: So I was my dad immigrated here and education was the thing that he felt place he felt he belonged in public school and how he learned to belong. So he was always enamored. That was something that's in our household growing up and then as an adult when I had to make a decision about where to spend my time after becoming a parent, if I'm not going to be with my own family, I want to do something. My parents were public school teachers. I was a Portland public school student and my children are all public school graduates. And I spent my career working government, county government. I just so strongly believe that.

end time: 382:55:58.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Excellent. Thank you all for sharing that. I hear a moral imperative, I hear a passion, I hear a purpose that is pretty well grounded and very similar among you. It doesn't surprise me if you're drawn to serve on a school board. You have similar motivation to come on Friday set to many of you individually come on a Friday before a three day weekend shows a willingness to sacrifice on behalf of children. I will tell you though I've been retired for two years now, I am passionate about what public education means for our young people. Just believe in our young people and what their future can be like if the adults involved will just give them a helping hand in some direction. And so flying five and a half hours and get getting in around 11:30 last night, I don't consider a sacrifice. It's my contribution. If you're willing to work together, then I'm willing to do anything I can to help school boards and superintendents across the country do that work and have the pleasure and the joy of working with so many of them. So let me just say thank you for your sacrifice. Sacrifice not for today. I know we've made light of the holiday weekend. But for serving on a school board, particularly one that does not offer any compensation to board members, is a contribution that at least deserves a thank you. So thank you for what you do for the children here in Portland, 44,000 students and their families. I owe you a debt of gratitude. All right, so now we're going to talk about our little personality session called True Colors. Let me just give you a little bit of background. I don't want you to be at all overly concerned about this. Anybody ever do Myers Briggs?

start time: 382:58:54.000
end time: 383:10:06.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yes.

start time: 383:11:58.000
end time: 420:22:08.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Okay. So the folks who did Myers Briggs, really one of their students, actually is behind the True Colors. So it is not totally separated from what the research says brought extra copies out or staff brought extra copies, but everybody has. Anybody needs an extra copy. It's a. It's a short, briefer method than Myers Briggs, but about 95%. 90 to 95% of the time, if you take it again, the results are reliable at least about 90% of the time. And so we're going to talk through just a little bit about it. That the intent was to make for better working environment, that not to put labels on people, but that knowing your personality type and understanding how you work as well as knowing other people's personality styles and how they work would make for a working environment that was more cohesive, that had less stress, less division for the working environment. So let's just go ahead and dive right in. So I want to know who turned up with their primary. Remember, you can be a primary and a secondary. You can certainly be a hybrid, if you will, of more than one style. You can have two or three match your personality. So I'm going to let you identify yourself. And then I have this curious question just because I'm curious by nature. As you were going through it, were you able to identify the possible personality type for a spouse, a partner, a friend, a co worker? Like, first time I did it, I knew immediately what my husband was, and first time he looked it over, he knew immediately what I was. Because we've been married for 35 years now. But. But I will be curious to hear if you sort of diagnosed or pinpointed someone else. So how many blues do we have in the room? And if you. And if you had a tie vote, just raise your hand for both the colors. Okay. Three blues. Keep tabs on this for me. So we know how many blue I've got. I've got Deborah, Kim, Patty and Gary are blues. All right, how many goals? You're a tie. Patty's a tie for gold.

Yeah, it's accidental. It's just, I think, logically driven. I like to analyze everything, maybe to a fault, and then also very efficient. I was. I think I was. I was diagnosed for ADHD when I was an adult. And that makes me very good at. I mean, I always known, but that makes me very good at hyper focusing, which is like, when there's a task that really find very important, I get it done and I do it really well.

end time: 559:56:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So blue. But no, I. Well, it's a two point difference and actually I struggle with one of the questions, which I think if I were to answer different, it would have had green number one. Because I don't think that I'm emotionally driven.

start time: 559:57:30.000
end time: 560:28:42.000
confidence: 0.83
B: So you're a blue green or green? Blue.

start time: 560:29:46.000
end time: 563:48:26.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I, I know that I'm more green, but I will say that because I think I've presented as very green before. I've learned to be more blue. So some of those responses resonate with me.

start time: 563:49:38.000
end time: 564:06:04.000
confidence: 0.63
B: Learn behavior.

start time: 564:08:02.000
end time: 567:45:40.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Yeah, yeah. So if I were to tease out like natural state versus how I've learned to be because you know, you're great if you get further with blue and education.

start time: 567:50:40.000
end time: 575:48:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So gotta have some of all of it really. So let me just disclose a little bit about myself. So I am agreeing. Been married for 35 years. My husband leans toward a balloon slash gold. So there are things we know about each other. When you do a personality, say, oh, that's why. Oh, I get it now. Like my husband knows. Don't repeat the same thing to me. I can't take the repetition. After a while, after 35 years, must say, get to the point.

start time: 576:01:30.000
end time: 576:14:58.000
confidence: 0.79
D: That story is.

start time: 576:15:54.000
end time: 606:40:54.000
confidence: 0.96
B: That's the way my brain works. I take in information. I want to get synthesizing and, and I want to get to some solutions rather than the other version. But as a superintendent, you can't just say get to the point. Now my staff will say, she's a data queen. Actually there was a title. State of Florida recognized me as a data driven, data driven leader. It was not data queen. My staff coined that. Don't bring me just an idea what your gut is telling you, what you're really starting to feel passionate about. Show me the data. And so I'm very data driven. But I have to adjust. I had to adjust in order to be able to communicate well with folks in the other areas. You don't want to hurt someone's feelings unintentionally. I ask questions because I'm Gathering and synthesizing, probably. Much like Eddie said. Gathering and synthesizing. This is. This is where you're going to explain it to your wife next time. Gathering and synthesizing. I'm not doing a drill and kill. I'm not trying to torpedo you and trying to stump you so you can't answer the question. I'm gathering data. So understanding that about the different personality traits types really does help in how you engage. And so we're going to group ourselves by colors and we're going to talk about the tips for the true colors. There are ways that you can limit stress for each other because I'm going to tell you what the greatest sources of stress are for each individual color. And then we're also going to talk about how you as an individual work through your color. Here's some things you might consider or do differently so that you engage better with others. And then the third section is around communicating with the various colors. So if you are. I'm gonna let you organize yourselves by color. I'm just kind of waiting and let you take charge and organize yourselves. Two of us. See, I knew somebody would jump in.

confidence: 0.96
A: So one of the. One of the things that, you know, I struggled with my whole educational career was like the sense of urgency was important to be driven. And so when. When something is given like a long term project and a really hard time to kind of map it out, be like, oh, I need to do this ahead of time. It always just came down to, you know, procrastinate until the last day.

start time: 843:36:38.000
end time: 850:01:34.000
confidence: 0.92
B: And then it seems strange that a green would have that as one of the things you have to be careful of. Estimation, the driving nature of getting it done is somehow harmed or tilted a little bit when you've got deadlines that are way out into the future. It is. It's an odd. It's oxymoron in my opinion.

confidence: 0.97
D: Give them the big picture and then details. Have asked I feel like I like to orient myself in space around projects or whatever work I'm doing or information and processing. I really need big picture need to see the system, a system system and then locate the issue within the system.

end time: 893:10:34.000
confidence: 0.98
B: And ask questions if you need to for clarification. Yeah, team coming in, one of our legal team would say let me unpack this for you. Stop because you're going to frustrate me. If you want to tell me every little detail before you get to the big issue. Yeah, I want to hear the big issue first.

Don't just go in saying here's everything that's bothering the superintendent, here's everything we need help on. If you got a solution, you can go in and say now we think we have a solution. We think we've got this worked out. Let us give you a couple of bits of detail before we get there. All right. Anything else stand out about communicating with.

start time: 911:29:44.000
end time: 951:28:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Like self regulate so so everybody knowing each other's style. It does help with some self regulation and sometimes you just do this under the table so nobody can. Nobody can see you doing it. Julia, you say get that nobody knows it, that you're self taught and it's helping you to bring it down a notch. And then you have more patience as you're listening. Here's a way we can wrap this up. Each color is associated with certain personality traits and behaviors. Remember Myers Briggs, three psychologists. In fact I even had their names for you. Not that it's important. Isabel Briggs, Myers, Catherine Briggs and David Kearsey. Lots of work proven over the years. Myers Briggs, trustworthy. Don Lowry was a student of Kirsey and he's the one that simplified it into and first started the true colors assessment, making it much simpler. Each color is associated with a person, certain personality traits and behaviors. Everyone has some degree of each color, but one color is usually predominant. So when you consider your colors, the variations, the blends, it's not a pure scientific study. It's not a purely scientific instrument. It just gives you a little bit more insight into human nature and how your peers work and think and process. And having that information maximizes the workplace setting because you understand your own style and you understand others as well. Want to encourage you. Especially someone said they did theirs in pencil. You can certainly get another copy. It's public domain. Roseanne can get you another copy. If you want to try it out on your spouse. Doesn't mean you have to give them all the cheating points later on. Gary, keep that to yourself. No, if you. If you share it with someone that you're in a close relationship with and share all of the information, I think it's very, very useful. So thank you for being candid, for going through the assessment. I'll work with you on the lunch break on yours, and we will move on to the next portion. Just so you know, Herman. So everybody has disclosed to Herman their colors, because he is going to disclose after the lunch break what his color is. Only a five minute assessment. I promise you, you'll be ready. But tell Gary what your colors were.

By the scripting. Jim McIntyre has joined us all the way from Tennessee. Jim could be with us here in person, worked with him several times. You heard his background information when the chair did the introductions earlier. And so we're going to give Jim before he jumps into governance because he's going to take on a portion of the presentation. Now, before I get to the case study, I want to give Jim a minute in three or four sentences. Jim, you've already got someone who's beat you out. Can't beat the one sentence that Herman just gave us. But in three or four sentences, tell us why you entered K12 education.

I'm a professor, so I'm going to try to do the same and feel the same kind of pressure to do that. Just a bit of my background first. You heard my background. But I've been an educator for a very long time and I think my purpose, the reason that I'm in this work is really grounded in the power of education. As a classroom teacher many years ago, what I saw was students coming from varied backgrounds and experiences and often some challenging circumstances, but the power of education to transform their lives, the power of high quality instruction, to engage them in learning and to put them on a different trajectory, to allow them to be successful and to have a brighter future is what I have spent the last 30 years or so since I've been in the classroom trying to do at scale. I don't know, Barbara, how'd I do? Dr. Jenkins, is that okay?

E: Yeah, so again, you've heard a little bit about my background, but I spent many years at the Boston Public schools in Massachus and eight years as superintendent of schools in Knoxville, Tennessee. And so I've seen two different, well, many different school boards work together with their superintendent. And I've tried to be a student of what it looks like to be an effective school board and an effective governance team, which is the school board and the superintendent working together. So that's going to be. I think the bulk of our time today is going to be talking about how do we create a really positive working relationship among the board and with the superintendent, how to create the sort of working relationship that's going to lead to even greater learning outcomes for students and even greater opportunities, educational opportunities for students. How do we create the kind of protocols, the kind of mutual commitments, the kind of practices that will lead to an effective governance team of the board and the superintendent working together and ultimately lead to sort of enhanced learning and success for our kids, which I know I didn't get to hear all of your discussion of why you're in this, but I can't imagine that virtually everyone would have said because they want to make a difference in the lives of young people. So when you received the presentation early in the week, you may have been a bit overwhelmed by the length of the deck and the many words that are on some of the pages. But I want to just reassure you that our intent is really just to end this retreat today, to give you the time and space to look at your current operating procedures and protocols around the working relationship with the board and with the superintendent, to see how you all feel about them and to have a conversation about if there are any additions or changes or refinements that you'd like to consider. I want to just be clear, And I'm sure Dr. Jenkins said this at the outset, we have enormous respect for the work that you do. The work of being a superintendent of schools in today's world is enormously challenging and difficult and important. And the work of being an effective school board is just incredibly powerful. School boards that can work together to work effectively and to really have an excellent governance perspective and relationship can just create incredible opportunity for young people and move the district in such positive ways. And we're just really excited that you're interested in having, continuing that conversation, because I know you've had a lot of that conversation over the years, but continuing that conversation. And I just want to say at the outset that we have so much respect and appreciation for the fact that you've stepped up. Being a school board member can be. You won't recognize this, but can be a bit of a thankless job. Right? It is challenging. It's enormously important. But it, you know, you often. There aren't a lot of people who often call you up and say, hey, just want to say thank you. There's a lot of people who call you up, say, I have this challenge, or I have this concern, or I have this issue. But I think at the outset, we just want to say thank you for the work that you do, for your commitment to young people, and for taking the time and committing this part of your life to doing that important work. So all that as a precursor to the conversation, I want to also keep in mind that we're not making decisions today, Right. Our goal is to facilitate some good discussion and dialogue, hopefully to come to some general consensus on some ideas and some concepts, and then at a future board meeting, if you wish to, to make some modifications, some adjustments, some enhancements, some refinements to your current protocols as you see fit. But I think it's important for us to come together and to think about this for a couple of reasons. One, I'm a big fan of a book that some of y'all may have written, is called Atomic Habits by James Clear. And part of the premise of the book of Atomic Habits is that we don't rise to the level of our goals, right? We actually rise to the level of our systems and habits. That's true individually, as persons, and also as organizations. So I know many of you have been sort of in athletics. I know Director Hollins and Director Bram Edwards and Dr. Armstrong have all been in sports and athletics. I think several of you have as well. So I use the analogy of a marathon, right? So I may have a goal that I want to run a marathon, and that's something that's important to me. That's an objective that I've set. But if my systems and habits are that every morning I go and eat a half dozen donuts instead of going and running three to five miles, I'm not likely to be able to achieve that goal, right? So the. The idea is, how do we create the systems, the protocols, the practices that are going to put us in a place for the board, for the governance team, the board and the superintendent working together to be successful, and therefore for our school system and our students in particular to be successful.

B: Jim, you know, I thought of another athletic analogy around this whole notion of coherence. You may have different skill sets, you may have different personalities, I said, but Steve Kerr of Golden State warriors is incredible at bringing together those different. Well, now they're breaking up the team. Let's think. Think championship team, because there are a couple of personalities on there who I thought, get rid of him. But a couple personalities on there. He was masterful at Bringing together coherence, different, I am certain, different values, different relationships, different elements, different talent. But he was masterful at bringing that all together for some kind of consistent, systematic functioning that brought about success. And so I love your analogy around athletics as well.

confidence: 0.97
E: Yep. So about systems and habits. And I think the good news is when I start to think about. And Dr. Jenkson, I don't know if we can move to the next slide and begin to get into that conversation. I think the good news is really that you've done a lot of work on this question of governance. You've done a lot of work on this question of an effective governance team. And as Dr. Armstrong comes into the role as superintendent, I think there's a really good infrastructure for that. You have some really good language in some of your policies and your. And your practices and your protocols to be able to support excellent governance. And you have a track record, I think, of working together. And, you know, you've been engaged in this conversation, I think, even very somewhat intensively about a year ago, talking about some of these questions and issues. Some of that didn't get to resolution just because we know a lot has happened in the last year since this time last year. And so what our hope today is to bring back some of those conversations, to look at what you currently have in place in terms of your language and your protocols around the governance structure and to see if there are tweaks or adjustments or refinements that you want to make to then really for all of us to sort of commit to. Yes. This is the structure that we have in place. These are the things that are important to us. This is how we're going to operate and then move to move forward together and doing this important work for children. So, y'all, honestly, if you're happy with where you are, it's going to be a pretty short retreat. Right. We'll have a pleasant conversation. We'll have a lovely lunch. We'll be on our way. But I suspect there may be some of these issues that it will be healthy and useful to revisit and to dig into a little bit, and there may be some enhancements or some refinements that you want to consider. So we're going to start with. I'll stop there. Any questions about what we're going to undertake or where we're headed? Okay, great. So I'm gonna stop there.

E: Great. Beautiful. And thank you to Ms. Bradshaw and Ms. Powell. The fact that I'm here, and that y'all can hear me is. Is a beautiful thing. And I can hear you is as well. I will say one more thing. I. I would normally be in the room with you and, and Dr. Jenkins. I'm. I'm glad she's there and that she. You all have allowed me to come here. Two things that are happening. One, I'm the dean of the College of Education, assistant provost here at Belmont University, and it's the first full week of school, so that's challenging to be able to move away from. But secondly, just to be, you know, fully transparent, my wife has Parkinson's disease. And so she's 53 years old. She's young, but she's been diagnosed from. For about 10 years. And so for me to travel across country for is sometimes challenging. So I appreciate the grace and the willingness to allow me to come in and have this conversation with you virtually. So thank you for that. So we have in front of us, we're going to talk a little bit about the governance relationship. And again, for many of you, probably for most of you, this is not new. This is a conversation that has been ongoing. But I find it's just useful to remind ourselves and to revisit these questions on a regular basis just to make sure that how we are operating is consistent with what is known to be good practice. So I'm going to talk to you, we're going to do a couple of things here. I'm going to talk to you at a very high level about the governance relationship in public school districts in America. And then we're going to do a case study which will hopefully make it a little bit more real. Then we'll dive into some of the research around what does it look like to be an effective school board? What do school boards that really influence positively student learning outcomes look like? How do they operate? How do they work together? And then we're going to look specifically at how you all operate and the language that you have in place, the protocols and procedures and practices that you have in place. And then are there any interest in making tweaks to that going forward? So this is a graphic from the Florida School Boards association, because you all are, you know, I think probably have a good working relationship with school boards associations, both locally and nationally. I'll. I'll make reference to a couple. We'll have some information that will come from the National School Boards association and from different school boards associations, including your own across the country. But this one's from Florida, and it's just a nice little almost literally roadmap of the governance versus management, right? And so the basic idea behind the way that school boards are designed to operate in the US and in Oregon is that the school board has really the overarching authority to, to run and to oversee schools in public schools in the district, right? So they, the school board is meant to set a vision for the future of the school, school district. Where are we headed? What do we want the outcomes to look like for our district and for our kids? What and then specifically what are our goals within that vision? And how do we, you know, what does that want? What do we want that to look like going forward? And then school boards adopt policies, right? They adopt and you have a whole host of policies that dictate how we think we can achieve that vision and those goals. What might that look like? And in, in Oregon and other places, you also have a responsibility around resources, around finances, around appropriating a level of resources that you think are going to, is going to be adequate to serve students well and to work with the school system to make sure that those resources are distributed equitably and prioritized in ways that are going to get to great outcomes for kids. And then you evaluate outcomes, see how the district and the school system leadership is moving in the direction that you want to see, making sure that they are following policy and making sure that they are achieving that the goals that you have set and realizing the vision that you have cast. And then on the other side of that sort of proverbial line is management, right? So that's governance. That's what school boards do. That's how they, they oversee at a high level the work of school systems. And then on the, on the management side is really the day to day operations of, of the school system. What happens, how do, how is the school system led and managed on a day to day basis? How do we move toward making sure that policies are followed, that statutes and regulations are followed to make sure that the board's vision and the goals of the board are, are being that we're moving in the direction of achieving those goals and that vision? And then how do we operationalize all of that? How do we manage the day to day work of that happening? And that is the purview of the superintendent. That is the, the role and the work of the superintendent. In, in Tennessee we call them directors of schools, but that's the work of, of superintendents to lead the district and to implement policy and to work toward achieving the goals and vision of the school board. If you go to the next slide, I, I think it sums up what I tried to just say in some words. And so for those of you who like to sort of. Of see it on paper or on a. On a slide deck, this is what I think the summary says. I'll let you just take a second and to read that. But this is the sort of the divide between governance and between management, between what the school board does and what the superintendent does. I'm going to stop there for just a second to see if there are questions, to see if there are clarifying questions or if there are any reactions to that. And, and we're going to dig deeper into this. We're actually going to dig. So forgive me, I am a professor. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna. I'm going to bring you into the research in a few minutes and we'll talk a little bit more about the research around effective school boards. But this is the basic divide between governance and management, between what the super. What the school board is intended to undertake and the superintendent. Questions, reactions.

H: Thanks. Thanks, Jim. And I know we're going to go deeper, so maybe I'll just pose this as a question that I would like to dive deeper into. I've been on the board for about five years. I've gone to two of the Harvard, you know, council, great city schools, leadership institutes, done some of the conferences. Here's one of my frustrations. We always talk about how a board's job is to adopt policy and to adopt budget. Two of the, two of the key things they do. And we always put that on the school board role. And then we talk about superintendent's role. What, what I have not seen unpacked is that adopting policy and adopting a budget can be done very, very differently. So you can adopt policies and budgets at a high level that is directional, that sort of vision, direction, and sort of says, this is where we're going as a district and you allow your superintendent to take that and implement it. And you can adopt policy and budget at a very granular, detailed, very prescriptive level that dives very deep into operations and so that it's really easy. And all of us in this room are going to say, yep, that's the board's role, is to adopt policy and budget. But how we adopt policy and budget makes a huge difference in terms of this governance. So I hope we can really dive into the specifics around that.

E: I love that because you're absolutely right. And part of that is what are the Interests and the preferences of the individual school board. But I think when we get into the research, we will address a little bit of that. I think there is an interest in enabling and empowering the. The leadership of the district to have some opportunities for creativity, to have some opportunities to. To realize the vision of the board and even the policies of the board in ways. So setting the, the expectations, setting the results that are wanted, setting the outcomes that you want to see, and enabling the district leadership to move in that direction. But to have a little bit of latitude to do that is where I think a lot of the research comes down. But again, that's really the prerogative of the board. That is really, I think, the choice of the board. But I think a lot of the effective school board research that we see is going to skew a little bit toward giving broader latitude, giving broader opportunity for creativity and innovation to the district leadership. So with, you know, I think the, you know, you sort of see the, the policies as some real important guidelines and guardrails to make sure that the district is moving in the right direction. But I think allowing for some, allowing for some opportunities for district leadership to be creative, to bring some solutions to the board that maybe wouldn't be necessarily. That you wouldn't necessarily put embed into policy at a granular level is there's. I think there's some value in that. But, yeah, we'll dig. We'll dig deeper into that, for sure, would agree.

start time: 1323:22:18.000
end time: 1364:54:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And further. So I think there's a continuum of boards being engaged and engaged appropriately where they impact student learning and student achievement. One extreme might be almost paralyzing to creativity and bringing solutions to the board, and the other one is probably too far, far removed. So I'll give you an example. If the board says, you know what, our reading outcomes are just horrific, and we need you to come up with some solutions around the reading outcomes. At the end of the day, we're going to hold you accountable for reading outcomes. That's the. What the. How you get there should be left more up to administration. When you look at the budget, you don't say, well, I'd like you to spend more money on this program, this program and that program. The question to pose is, how are you investing our dollars? Show me how you're investing to accomplish the goal. We gave you around reading outcomes. So the question is around. Give me the details. I told you what I'm looking for, but I'm still holding you accountable for some of those details as well. I love to use facilities as A possibility because interesting things have happened in Florida in the past. A couple of board members, not in my district down south, who got more into the how of who got major contracts and landed them with some brief jail sentences. For the board to say, we want a quality facility, we want it within budget, going to hold you accountable for that. And then the details of the how are worked out by staff and the superintendent is held accountable is appropriate. There's a district spinning, had some notoriety where a board member said, I don't like the selection that you gave the new high school to. We need to redo as policy leaders. We need to redo some criteria for the selection process so that it comes out differently and favors a local construction company that's way below the line, on the wrong side of the street and can lead to trouble. But being intense enough to say, this is what we're holding you accountable for. Show me where it's in the budget. You don't just bring me a budget and ask me to pass it and I have absolutely no input. Show me where it is in the budget, where we set these priorities. I'd like to see how you're proposing that. We will invest that. And at the end of the day, I'm going to probably accept your recommendations around the how, but I'm still going to have to hold you accountable for the outcomes at the end of the year.

start time: 1365:09:30.000
end time: 1397:38:50.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Yeah. And I think it's a great. A really. A great reminder for us to dig into those questions, Director Scott, because I think they're really important ones. I would also say that there is, from my perspective, and I understand, I come from a certain perspective, but from my perspective, one of the most important things that a school board does is hire and evaluate a superintendent of schools. And you'll see that in the research. And you've done that beautifully. Right. You've hired a tremendous leader and someone who I think can really move the district in a very positive direction. And so you want to give that individual and the leadership of the district the opportunity to do that. And I want to acknowledge also, it's actually a great segue because we're going to move into a case study in just a second that makes this very real. But I want to acknowledge, again, this is hard. You all run for office. You put yourself out there. You. You put yourself on the ballot and in front of the voters, and you say, these are the things that I want to accomplish. And you know what's interesting and sometimes paradoxical about the literature? The research that it says that to the extent that you are able to set the parameters and set the direction and, and hold people accountable but not get in the weeds, you're actually likely to be more successful in terms of student outcomes that way. And so. But that's really hard, right, because you sit for, you know, in front of the voters and you ask them to vote for you, and you are going to be on the ballot again. And so there's a tendency to want to do more, to want to go deeper, to want to get really granular. But again, we'll dig into the research in just a minute. But what it really says is that when you set that vision, when you give the leadership the opportunity to meet that vision and to do so by meeting your policy and your policies that you've put in place and you hold them accountable, that's when you really see great traction and movement in terms of student learning and success.

G: Yes. When we talk about, talk about monitoring progress toward business and goals, you know, are we, I hope we can like, speak on what are some of those matrix that we use our milestones that we use throughout the year to monitor. You know, one of the things that I think we haven't done, at least for myself, is knowing where we at, you know, in our milestones, to make that sure that we are on path, meeting the goals that we have. And so I think that's something that we talk about today.

E: I think that's terrific, Director Hollins. And I think that that really speaks to the importance of not just the vision, but also the strategic planning process. So to really dig in to what we as a school board and what we as a community expect for our students, what we want, what we desire, what we aspire to for our students, and to develop a strategic plan that says this is what we envision, this is where we want to go and to start to get to the specificity of. And this is what it looks like when we get there. And here are the interim metrics, here are the interim measures that we're going to look at along the way to make sure we're on the right track. And if we're not, we can course correct and make sure that we are asking the superintendent, asking the district leadership, you know, what are we going to do about this, what we're falling short on this particular metric? What's your plan to make sure that we hit it. So I think a really comprehensive strategic planning process, I know that's on a brief part of our agenda toward the end, but I think a really important and comprehensive strategic planning Process at a detailed level that really engages the community is something that I know the school board in Portland has done in the past, has done nicely in the past, and has engaged the community to have that conversation. And then it requires that continuous assessment, that continuous looking at it, to make sure that it's not just a document that you look at every five years, and it's a, it's a beautiful graphic and things like that, but it's actually something that you, you do monitor, that you do talk about, that you come back to every couple of months or every quarter to make sure you're looking at the progress. So absolutely agree. And I think that's something that we can continue to dig in in this.

B: Conversation as well, depending on the appetite of the board. That's an excellent point, Gary. There ought to be either quarterly or even monthly reporting out on portions of the outcomes that the administration is working on. Board has set these goals. Every month or every quarter, there ought to be some interim reporting out. So it's not a got you kind of deal or end of the year surprise of whether or not you've accomplished the goals. It's time for course correction as well.

start time: 1447:20:42.000
end time: 1450:59:10.000
confidence: 0.97
F: I have a question about that. So if we are using data that's like Oregon student assessment data for the goals and it's only available, say quarterly, then what would reporting look like out?

end time: 1462:46:28.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Unless you have your own internal assessment of students and you can say, we've seen this much growth through Edmentum or Iready or something, and you're able to collate and roll up those numbers, at least you have some interim reports to say, you know what? We're not at this rate. We think we've been too lofty in our expectations. Our students and teachers are not getting to those points at least as rapidly as we had hoped. So no surprise, however you're able to gather the data is how you can certainly report out. Once it can be synthesized. It can't be daily, that's for certain. But once it can be synthesized and shared with the board, then that's helpful, and then it gives the administration a chance to course correct. Kim?

C: Yeah, I think the only thing I would add is it would be helpful to know when we talk goals, are we talking strategic plan goals or we talk in board goals? They are different. And so I think that will be helpful as the conversation moves forward so that I'm clear.

E: Okay, so we're going to dive into a little bit of a case study and a couple of things about case studies. One, I find it's always easier to talk about other people than talk about ourselves. So we're going to talk about a case study. I think it's somewhat realistic and it's very quick. It's two pages, so it'll just take five or six minutes to read and, and then we'll have some conversation about it. Barbara will. Will help facilitate maybe some, you know, some one on one conversations or small group conversations. But we want to give just a concrete example of the governance versus management kind of conversation that needs, that happens. And it doesn't just happen in Portland. It happens all across the country. And to acknowledge that these are important conversations and challenging conversations about to Andrew's point earlier, where do we, where do we, you know, where we draw the line probably isn't that unclear. But how granular do we get in policy? How detailed do we get in the budget? All of those types of questions I think are really important and these things surface from time to time. So Barbara, are you able to hand out the, the case?

start time: 1511:08:40.000
end time: 1518:11:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yes, we received it, so I just handed it out. Let me just give you a couple of precursors as well. You notice at the top of this document. So Harvard's very picky about their intellectual property. It's copywritten. So by the time we're done, I'll just gather them back from you. Jim and I both have to Pay a little fee if you go through here to get permission to use it. But this is a very brief one. It's about a page and a half. John Kim, I'm several of you ace.

D: Yes.

end time: 1524:22:12.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Remember John Kim. He actually wrote this particular case study. And so it leans more. Rather than looking at another genre, another entity, it looks specifically at public education. So take a minute to read it. Notice the details, because we're going to work through it in the Harvard way like any other case study. So notice the details as you read.

start time: 1524:25:16.000
end time: 1524:52:52.000
confidence: 0.91
F: And we can write on this?

start time: 1524:55:56.000
end time: 1592:54:20.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yes, you can write on it. I just can't let you take it. Not that I think she would copy it and sell it, but I don't want to deal with issues. 30 seconds. All right, so we're going to break it down on my whiteboard. I wish I had one of those. Lovely rolling as well. Competition there. Yale I've not seen as well. The P loves those.

confidence: 0.96
B: I want to break it down this way just to make this dissect what's going on here so it could be easy. Just jump right into the problem and what could have been done differently. But I want to break it down first to really try to understand what happened with the chair, what happened with the superintendent, what happened with Garcia. So what do they tell us? And by the way, when you answer sometimes or you make proposals, I'll ask you to cite it in the actual case study. And I reserve the right for cold calling when nobody volunteers. That's the Harvard way. Cold call somebody and makes everybody at least pay attention. So what we know about the district in general before we talk about that particular community where the school was being built. I'm sorry, where the school principal was turning over. What do we know about from the case study in general about the district and that particular school community?

end time: 1650:54:56.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Okay, what else we know about the chair. Was he timid and soft spoke? That's what I was looking for. He is pretty direct. Wasn't direct. That means he was Gary.

end time: 1659:15:42.000
confidence: 0.90
E: Yeah, I had a school board chair in Boston who didn't pause between is there any discussion and hearing none. The motion carries. So you sometimes see a little bit more directive types of chairs and this.

start time: 1659:16:06.000
end time: 1660:35:26.000
confidence: 0.97

start time: 1667:48:00.000
end time: 1668:12:24.000
confidence: 0.87

G: That's what the chair.

start time: 1668:27:28.000
end time: 1672:05:24.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So it's clear a superintendent willing to talk individually. I don't think the chair would have said that if it was untrue. Yeah. One on one. What else?

start time: 1672:07:52.000
end time: 1672:40:00.000

start time: 1675:37:40.000
end time: 1681:45:28.000
confidence: 0.96
F: But somehow the superintendent had seemed too busy to that to Garcia and not seemed open to that particular board. It seemed. Was it her job to just share her expertise with the superintendent for the best it seemed like the superintendent was busy. She could really help and work together.

start time: 1681:46:24.000
end time: 1682:50:16.000
confidence: 0.94

start time: 1682:53:28.000
end time: 1683:29:40.000
confidence: 0.80
F: But anyways has seemed to her.

start time: 1683:34:40.000
end time: 1683:45:44.000

B: Yeah.

start time: 1683:47:52.000

F: Anyway.

start time: 1683:55:52.000
end time: 1687:22:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I'm thinking it that way. You seem busy which makes you wonder when we talk about communication later on is there a regular cadence of one on one interaction with board members or do they just catch him when. When they can anything else?

start time: 1687:45:20.000
end time: 1688:21:00.000
confidence: 0.92
F: It seemed kind of passive.

start time: 1688:37:20.000
end time: 1689:04:08.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Passive like that for me.

start time: 1689:06:24.000
end time: 1691:54:00.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Well the past because doesn't seem like they did anything besides expressing like displeasure versus letting the the board president say.

start time: 1691:54:40.000
end time: 1694:37:30.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Something which what was it just a look on his face or he scowled or something was it didn't show like frustrated pleasure but quote it for me.

start time: 1695:23:50.000
end time: 1696:00:46.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Garcia could sense real displeasure.

start time: 1696:03:58.000
end time: 1696:43:58.000
confidence: 1.00
B: You could sense it. So something was happening there.

start time: 1696:46:14.000
end time: 1702:25:40.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Yeah. And so like I could just pass it because the. The superintendent could have said something like I know you, you know are from that community and you have a lot of insights and I would love to talk to you before we start our process versus having the board president do it.

start time: 1703:13:20.000
end time: 1706:33:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So he did something that shows frustration, but he didn't directly communicate. He was passive. Board president intervene about the rest of the board. Before I get to member Garcia. How about the rest of the board?

start time: 1707:08:00.000
end time: 1712:14:20.000
confidence: 0.98
D: It was a mixed reaction from the board members. Some of them frowned in irritation at the suggestion. Another board member slowly shook his head. One of the other board members nodded in support. Another looked right at her and smiled. So there was kind of a mixed reaction from the. From the body.

start time: 1713:00:40.000
end time: 1714:00:32.000
confidence: 0.95
F: And another, the very last line, the.

start time: 1714:00:56.000
end time: 1714:52:20.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Shaking of your head. Nod and a smile.

start time: 1715:06:00.000
end time: 1715:48:50.000
confidence: 0.84
D: A lot of non verbal communication.

start time: 1716:02:30.000
end time: 1718:11:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And I see you smiling at me. I think that means I got your vote. I got your support. You may be smiling like this is not going anywhere.

start time: 1719:03:50.000
end time: 1719:16:50.000
confidence: 0.54

start time: 1719:27:50.000

B: No.

start time: 1720:29:10.000
end time: 1720:39:30.000
confidence: 0.74
D: Yeah.

start time: 1720:47:50.000
end time: 1728:19:38.000
confidence: 0.93
B: The non smilers did not telegraph their displeasure as well as the smiler, which is probably what an orange. Are you a smiler? Jump back into that. So a lot of non verbal feedback but unclear what it meant. All right, let's get to Garcia. Everybody wants to talk about Garcia. What do you know about her case study?

start time: 1728:21:54.000
end time: 1729:45:50.000
confidence: 1.00
D: She has deep experience in this community that is critical.

start time: 1730:03:30.000
end time: 1736:40:08.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Deep experience and connection in community social capital. Kind of what Jim was referring to earlier. She's elected by her constituents. They expect her to be able to make something happen. She's got connections. She's got experience. That's a good thing for a board member.

start time: 1736:41:04.000
end time: 1739:03:12.000
confidence: 0.99
I: She's also shown that she understands how to take nothing and grow it over a short period of time.

start time: 1739:04:56.000
end time: 1740:22:40.000
confidence: 0.85
B: I like that. Now what should you say that psych me. Tell me what. What gave you that conclusion? I like it.

start time: 1740:24:40.000
end time: 1757:02:40.000
confidence: 0.97
I: The. It was the CYP program that she. She started from the. The ground. She became the executive area executive director. She said Garcia successfully grew the program to serve more than a thousand students each year and green a successor. So not only does she have the ability to start something from nothing and grow it to becoming something extremely significant, she also understands the power of succession. A success is not a success if they don't have a successor. So she groomed someone, making sure that the person that was going to be coming into position understood the character, the values and everything so that when they. When she did leave, so she understands it. To me. I get the. I get the impression that she understands what it means to. To lead and to make way for the next leader to come.

start time: 1757:23:40.000
end time: 1758:03:20.000
confidence: 0.96

start time: 1758:13:00.000
end time: 1759:24:52.000
confidence: 0.98
H: Well, I mean, related to that connection. I mean the, the. I was really, I'm really interested in.

start time: 1759:25:16.000
end time: 1759:34:40.000
confidence: 0.92
B: The.

start time: 1760:03:00.000
end time: 1761:14:36.000
confidence: 0.90
H: The disconnect between what constituents expect versus what good governance is.

start time: 1761:15:48.000
end time: 1761:19:40.000
confidence: 0.83
A: Right.

start time: 1761:20:20.000
end time: 1764:33:48.000
confidence: 0.94
H: And so this comment about, you know, what's Garcia going to say to parents from the neighborhood when she sees them at the grocery store just really encapsulates them. Right. So you know, she's going to have to respond to her constituents when they say why aren't you more involved in this.

start time: 1764:36:04.000
end time: 1764:49:16.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Exactly.

start time: 1764:51:08.000
end time: 1765:16:12.000
confidence: 0.86
H: Even though it may not be the right governance.

start time: 1765:17:16.000
end time: 1767:22:52.000
confidence: 0.91
B: That's a question. It means there has to be communication so everyone understands the role of the board. What else do you say?

start time: 1767:24:36.000
end time: 1768:15:20.000
confidence: 0.87
F: So it's unclear whether she had like an orientation.

start time: 1768:22:20.000
end time: 1768:53:56.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Did she ever have an orientation?

start time: 1768:55:48.000
end time: 1769:00:20.000
confidence: 0.99
I: Right.

start time: 1769:01:00.000
end time: 1769:53:08.000
confidence: 0.98
F: Because like she's finding that out at a board meeting.

start time: 1769:54:04.000
end time: 1770:12:00.000
confidence: 0.98
B: At a board meeting.

start time: 1770:43:40.000
end time: 1775:08:00.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So that would be a question I have because providing a framework of how, what, what's the appropriate way for board members to share, maybe share their expertise of the history of the community. But that's still staying in the great point.

start time: 1775:18:30.000
end time: 1775:30:50.000
confidence: 0.54
B: But.

start time: 1775:46:30.000
end time: 1777:40:46.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Oh, having worked in the school directly, I think she's used to having an immediate impact to making a change.

start time: 1777:41:58.000
end time: 1778:02:54.000
confidence: 0.81
B: Cite that for me.

start time: 1778:05:42.000
end time: 1779:29:50.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So. Well, I think so then she's connected that to her next action which is.

start time: 1779:30:30.000
end time: 1779:52:14.000
confidence: 0.84
B: You know, running for school boards.

start time: 1779:53:02.000
end time: 1781:57:02.000
confidence: 0.97
F: So she's is used to having the ability to probably make more day to day decisions within that building.

start time: 1782:00:06.000
end time: 1785:51:50.000
confidence: 0.93
B: You know, that relates back to even what Herman said. She, she's run an organization and grown an organization. So she's accustomed to the operations side and getting immediate. Having an immediate impact or a decision that's important too.

start time: 1786:14:10.000
end time: 1797:54:10.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Would like to add that I would get the, I get the impression that she does understand a level of order because she stepped down. It says she stepped down from her executive role to become a board member. So she understands that there's a difference. But then she stepped down from the, the CYP board member to become a school board member. So she knows, I get the impression she understands order and a level of protocol because she's making, she's making succession steps each way. And it appears that just from what I'm, you know, what we're reading, that she's doing it in the right manner.

start time: 1798:07:50.000
end time: 1803:42:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: That's a great point. It's almost related to what, what Julia said earlier. Did she just not have an orientation to say this is the way we do it on the school board? Because you understand the difference between governance, hopefully, hopefully and her other organization. She's not going to still try to drive it as a board member. But the notion of orientation and expectations is critical.

start time: 1803:47:50.000
end time: 1807:43:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: But also I'm. I'm guessing that cyp, it is a nonprofit. Not guessing. It's in the second sentence. It's a nonprofit versus an education board. So the roles of the governing are. Are different.

start time: 1808:30:00.000
end time: 1812:11:12.000
confidence: 0.90
F: So very last sentence goes along with getting knowledge about what she should be doing because she says how should she approach the superintendent allowing her to hold her yet on Sorted.

start time: 1812:12:16.000
end time: 1815:55:50.000
confidence: 0.88
B: No, by extreme. On. Let's talk about her actions then. Missteps actions and were they driven by certain assumptions and what was her intent? So, Eddie.

start time: 1815:57:10.000
end time: 1823:38:50.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yeah, One thing that really stood out to me is again, my assumption, based on the reactions from the other board members and superintendent, was that her. I assuming her idea was not talked about with the superintendent or the board president beforehand, that it was a surprise to everyone. So the, the idea she proposed was not she assumed.

start time: 1823:41:30.000
end time: 1826:48:58.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Okay. To surprise everyone. Was there something, Eddie, in the case study that sort of gives us some insight into what may have encouraged her?

start time: 1826:49:54.000
end time: 1844:43:58.000
confidence: 0.96
I: That's what I was boldened her. Because in that direction it said she. She looked around. She looked around. And I was actually going to bring that up earlier when we talked about. About Garcia as a. I don't want to call it a character flaw, but I do want. I do believe that is something that we should all be aware of. And that's how we allow the motivations of other people or the tenor of other people to move us in a direction, wanting to please people. And she looked around. It says she looked around at the crowd and this encouraged her. So it was their faces, it was their nods. It was their acceptance of a truth. We're not denied that it was a truth, but she allowed the crowd to move her to make a decision. And we have to be careful. I think it's all. You have to be careful when you're allowing the crowd to push you to make a decision one way or another, right, wrong or different.

Because even if you look around at the crowd and you see it and you're feeling it, whatever, that's cool. We feel. I get you. But the moment she started talking and said I would like to propose, that's when it started going south. Everything after that was trash.

end time: 1904:16:58.000
confidence: 0.96
F: And that I think is a really good point, Gary, because it show goes back to this conversation about her training and the superintendent's lack of. Of direction. They should have. There should have been some comments in here about how they were going to. Instead of just giving a list of the. The hiring and you know, open the vacancies. The superintendent should have clarified to. To the community as well, who might not know the rules. And as part of our process, we always put together a selection committee made up with people. So obviously she didn't know how the hirings occurred, which it just to build on that. I mean we have a policy that there is community engagement and so like a different if. If she if they had something like that she could have then like said I know members of the community are interested in this. Here's how you would you know has to be on that committee or whatever. I'd like more empower the community to engage versus I'd like to be on the committee.

H: Andrew, I'm going to push back a little push on the idea that the first statement was because the first statement also strikes me as inherently political and maybe not necessarily so. So getting back to even before the right it's this, you know and I'm particularly what jumps out at me. The district needs to do a far better job of selecting a principal that understands the needs of the community stable leaders strength that our layer just namesake high school is not. It is not always inappropriate to criticize a superintendent or a district. There are times when arises that this does not feel anywhere close to that. To me it feels like that's something that saying to get political points be like look at me, look at me. I'm, I'm out there. But it actually does harm to both the superintendent and the district with that very public criticism from the dice versus saying this is an important hire. I want to make sure that you and the district are focused on this important hire that we're happy to do. And then in private you can have that conversation or you say this is unacceptable. But I, I always ask myself these case studies or when I see it in practice like what was the, what was the reason the public criticism happen?

start time: 1924:01:50.000
end time: 1949:34:10.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Yeah, can I, can I jump in here? Barbara? I think this is a really good point and really good point. And Herman, I think was hinting at this earlier as well. And this notion of we have public board meetings, right. And we talk about this in terms of inviting the public in certain ways to really provide public comment or to give input before decisions are made and things like that. But as at the end of the day, and I'm sure you've heard this said before, board meetings are meetings of the board in public. Right. And so the conversation really is meant to be among the governance team. The conversation is meant to be with the board and the superintendent. And sometimes like in this case, it feels like there's a little bit more of a conversation going on. There are some things being said that are not the target audience is not the people around the table. The target audience perhaps is the folks in the room. And that's a really, you know, that's a delicate balance. That's an interesting place to be. You're elected officials, you're in a public meeting, but the conversation is meant to move the district, the dialogue about the agenda, the dialogue about the work that's being done by the board forward and not necessarily to make sort of public facing pronouncements that are intended for your constituents. It's really meant to be about the work that's happening at the board table. So it's a challenge and it's a constant, I think, struggle and balance. But just wanted to highlight that because I think both, both Herman and Andrew have, have really surfaced that, that question.

start time: 1949:41:50.000
end time: 1988:40:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Absolutely. And Andrea, I like what you said about something can be said in private or in one on one with the superintendent and other things are for public consumption. Good intentions. Absolutely. Good intentions. May have been swayed because there are folks in the audience that are kind of egging her on a little bit. She can't read the response of the other board members. Also, probably lightest misunderstanding of the role of an individual board member who cannot direct the superintendent versus the entire board, agreeing and coming to conclusion that directs the superintendent. And again, the question I always think of when I read the study is what was her onboarding, who trained her, who told her what the role was like for school board members versus other board members? So I heard you lean toward this last part that we will finish up on the alternative path. What could she have done differently to stay on the correct side of the street on governance versus where she ended up getting sort of correct from the board chair, which, by the way, it's, it's uncomfortable. But the board superintendent does not instruct and manage and correct board members. The board chair has to kind of do the herding of the cats. We, we love that term because cats are lovable. But hurting them and making sure that the board as a whole is staying under the purpose of governance falls on the chair, but it also falls on every board member to say that, that we're moving into operations. I'd like the superintendent perhaps to bring us back a report and some recommendations around how we make sure we have the best possible principal for this school. And not just the best principal. You get a wonderful principal that hangs around and does nothing for student achievement says achievement has been defined. So it's twofold. It's not just getting somebody who's going to stay because if he stays and he's happy, go lucky and everybody loves them and student achievement still continue to go down. That's not a solution. So the problem is twofold. Declining achievement and turnover of the principal. So give me some, some Verbiage of how it could have been done differently. Alternative path. I already heard public works and private. I want you to say a little bit more about that. Andrew, what could she have done?

start time: 1988:49:40.000
end time: 1995:25:02.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Yeah, I mean I think there's a, I think there is a public statement that can be made and some of this, you know, pulled from this about like this is an important school, it's important that we have stable leadership there. I think in private there could have been a conversation about how important this was and that frustration. And then I think we've already talked about other people said it. I think putting, you know, putting out there and actually turning to the superintendent that moment saying, you know, could you outline a little bit of the path?

start time: 1995:26:06.000

end time: 2003:13:10.000
confidence: 0.93
H: What is, what is the plan? Which I think Julie made the point. You know, in our situation, we have a policy that superintendent could say we're going to follow a policy. We're going to have a selection committee. We're going to go through this process. And I think boards can also offer some generic, like let us know how we can support you in that process. It's a very open ended. It shows that you care. The community is going to hear that. They're going to say, oh good, you know, they're doing that. But then it allows for future conversation outside of a board meeting. What's the appropriate, what's the appropriate level?

start time: 2004:14:10.000
end time: 2009:26:56.000
confidence: 0.96
B: As if there is an actual committee process where the community has some input on the selection, then that one on one meeting with the superintendent can say, hey, here three people that are movers and shakers in that committee. I would love for you to consider perhaps one of them being on it, not me, but perhaps one of these individuals being on, on the committee. What else? What would it sound like differently?

start time: 2009:27:28.000
end time: 2031:05:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Eddie, just backing off of Andrew's comment. I think ideally because I mean like I always assume the superintendent's on it because it's the problem and the superintendent is working on fixing this problem. So always a super assume. So like you know, if it, if it can't be planned ahead, you know, I think it's best to start with questions, you know, what's being done, what other plans in place to, to help mitigate. But it, I think even better would be some pre planning. So for example, if this, you know, the information should have been given to the board members beforehand and if, if this Garcia, if Garcia had issues would have contacts, Superintendent being like, hey, I'm worried about this principle, you know, could you share it with me? What are the things? And then at the board meeting could that or maybe set it up so that the board meeting that the superintendent could share. Like, you know, we have this issue, but this is our plan moving forward. And it. That would just be. It would be good for everybody. It's good for the superintendent. It's good for the board. It's good for the public to, to understand, you know, because distrust happens when people are left in the dark. Right. And I think that set up. Right. And so I think that that helps the public too to be understanding. Like, yeah, there's a problem. It is. They're actively working on that help.

confidence: 0.94
F: So, you know, I was thinking about the. The one on one conversation that follows it. And you know, I think being allowed to share her insights which should be helpful to the superintendent. I also think to me like just going to like the different roles is depending on what the superintendent's evaluation criteria is. That's the other way you can influence the process.

end time: 2054:15:00.000
confidence: 0.95
F: For example, is it just. Is Principal Churn just an issue at this school or is it a systemic issue? And that points to like a conversation between the board and superintendent perhaps. If that's, you know, one of their metrics. This presents evaluation. The other place is, I mean my assumption is they have academic outcomes as part of their evaluation process. And it's like here's my insights about the community and you know, that we're not getting the outcomes. And it's your role to ask the superintendent to say how we're going to improve the outcomes. And one of the ways is choosing the educational leader of the school. And having that be the sort of metric is like you're choosing. But you should know like this is how also at the end of the day that choice, one of the metrics of your evaluation is going to be.

start time: 2054:46:40.000
end time: 2055:08:08.000

confidence: 0.94
B: Great point, Gary. Well, the question anything else on the alternative path? What could she have done differently? Good intention. She meant well. Well meaning may have been unclear on her role and protocol. What could she have done differently?

start time: 2061:14:50.000
end time: 2072:03:30.000
confidence: 0.91
G: And I'll just not just my colleagues are saying, I think you know, her going to the Superintendent 101. If this is an issue with the system issue or is it just a school issue like Eddie was saying that going to superintendent ahead of time to ask some questions because this, I'm sure this didn't come up just at the board meeting. This has been an issue for this district for a while. So having that conversation with the Superintendent or some of our board members who might have been there before for her. Hey, what's going on with this school?

start time: 2072:13:50.000

E: Yeah, Barbara, can I ask, can I ask a question here? The, the, the point was raised a minute ago and I think Julia talked about it and you did as well about this moment. And I joked a little bit about, you know, a heavy handed board chair, but there's an art and a science to being a board chair. It's a really hard job. You, several of y'all have done it, and you know what I'm talking about. It's, it's a, it's a real, it can be a real challenge. But in that moment where the school board chair responded and the superintendent did not, I wonder if we can talk for just a minute about if that's the appropriate role of the board. Do we think that the board chair should have responded there or do we think that the superintendent should have responded there? Because the superintendent we often look to, for responses to questions and guidance and things like that. But this is a little bit of an awkward moment because this is sort of, in a way correcting a proposal or behavior of the part of a board member when that, you know, that's one of, in this case, it might be one of five or seven or nine people who as a whole are your boss. So I wonder if we could just talk a little bit about that dynamic of the superintendent certainly wanting to be, you know, being knowledgeable in the process, being able to offer something to the process, but also that dynamic of responding to someone who's part of their, you know, as a whole, someone who is supervising and evaluating, you know, their true color.

start time: 2098:23:30.000

confidence: 0.93
H: I think that's, I mean, I think it's exactly right. There's a power differential there. And I, I think it's unrealistic to expect a superintendent to say, you know, to the board member, oh, you're, you're, you know, you're wrong or you're outside your lane or that's how you go. I think that is the. And you know, you, one of you said it earlier, it's the board chair's.

H: I mean, it doesn't have to just chair others. I think as, as a peer, you have that ability to sort of, to sort of, you know, we have the ability as a group to correct one another. I think a superintendent, there's an art to this as well.

end time: 2122:37:50.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Yeah, like that. Because I feel like the board chair because they twice used the word but which I felt like she felt a sense of shame after kind of like I'm going to put you in your place because you don't know the rules. You don't know what you're role is and did that that if it would have been more instead of a but and this is the Lord's role versus role followed by the superintendent. It could have just given a graceful way into better. Back into a better governance structure. But like kind of bringing shame on somebody in a.

end time: 2128:15:50.000
confidence: 0.95
F: It creates a different dynamic then. And like I said, I think Andrew's right. This superintendent could very easily just followed up like you know, after the board chair said I'm sure they're interested in session like yes, we should set up a time to meet and you know, also share with you like how the process. The process we're planning on using.

start time: 2128:22:10.000
end time: 2130:22:34.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Absolutely. Because she could come back at the board chair a little bit more tersely after that.

start time: 2130:25:22.000
end time: 2179:40:24.000
confidence: 0.97
I: We're missing. Right. And so when you. When for me again, when you look at stuff like this, we have to look at it from the. I feel unless there's a pattern which I've read it again since we've been talking. Unless there's a pattern that would indicate that someone has had a. A pattern of doing something like this. A pattern of saying the wrong thing, you know, because again, I agree. Intent. Intent does not negate the impact. So we have to deal with. We have to deal with that and we also have to take into consideration the. The heart in which it. Which it was delivered. And so when you start looking at the messaging and what was happening, you start going back to Garcia and looking at it, you start noticing that she also felt let down and confused. Like wait a minute, I thought it was our job. I thought this is what we were supposed to be doing. I thought. And you see that by. It says she wanted to help the district with her deep knowledge and her experience. Her intention was to. I'm providing help. She felt like she could really help and Work together with the superintendent. You, you're starting to see that her positioning was never about calling anybody out. It was never about chasing an enemy. It was never about embarrassing anyone. It was never about, you know, like, I'm going to give this discipline or whatever to the. It's like she wanted to help the district with her deep knowledge and experience. She wasn't interested. And you start looking at it, she knew both sides. She wanted to support the southern part of the city, which is, if we go back to the beginning, the low income, marginalized people that have been left out part of the city, the ones that don't feel like they have a voice. So she's actually trying to be a voice for the voiceless. And she says, was it not her job? It says here. She didn't say it. But the question is, was it not her job to advocate for the under resourced and disadvantaged part of the city? So when you start looking at it from the perspective of she's intentionally trying to do good, there is no malice, there is no ill intention. There is no idea of wanting to embarrass. There is no idea of wanting to correct or cause harm. Everything that she's saying, she's saying from a space of I must, I want to help kids. I thought that's what we were all here for. And then when it comes back and you're like, you're out of line, you're. That's. She's confused, like, wait a minute, I, I thought that's what we were here to do, right? And now y'all are telling me, so now what am I, how do I speak to people when I don't understand my job? So it's not my job to speak for those that are marginalized. It's not my job to stand up for them. How do I talk to the person in the grocery store? It's not about like, I'm gonna be embarrassed or I got a side with them. It's about if I'm not supposed to advocate for them. If that's not we're all here for, then how do I go back to them and say, that's not what we do?

confidence: 0.95
B: So those are critical points too. I want to make three points along the same lines. The correction. What do we say about the chair? Pretty. We didn't say blunt, but he was very direct in his communication. The corrective statement could have been gentler, could have been more along the lines of understand your concern. Going to recommend that you have some time with the superintendent because we want to make sure. We stay in our governance role, but I absolutely understand it. For those of you in the audience, the board's role is governance, where we instruct the superintendent on what we expect and then legally he is responsible for making the recommendation for personal. So the, the corrective statement could have been gentler. Absolutely. It was very direct. You agree?

G: I was also going to talk. When we talk about the relationship with and the board, I also think, I think it's a lot of intuit based on that relationship that they have, that working relationship that the superintendent and the board have for a superintendent to be able to give her her thoughts on and how that culture is in support of that superintendent versus them feeling that, well, these are my bosses, I don't want to say nothing. And having that or relationship that she feel that she or he feel that they can't have that relationship, say, hey, this is my thoughts around this without. I'm worried about my job.

F: I, I just noticed that at the. It says at the last board meeting is when she had heard about the problem of the school. So she's time to think about it. And so again, I think it goes back to her not understanding process because she had plenty of time to talk to the super.

start time: 2210:17:40.000
end time: 2215:25:58.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I made a note. Onboarding cannot be overemphasized. So she understands the cadence of meetings and opportunities for feedback before you actually come to the public meeting. The other thing, some of Andrew's comments really could be used as an opportunity to kind of tutor the audience. Some of those statements.

E: I think that's right, Barbara. And going back to the, you know, Herman's point about how do you. How do you talk to that person in the grocery store about what your role is? How do you. How do you go back to your constituents? And I think both Herman and Andrew raised this earlier, you know, to inform and educate people about the role of the board members, about the role of the board as a whole and its notion of. Of governance? And how do you. How do you explain that to folks who might have very different expectations as to what they want you to do and want you to be? So I'm sure some of you who have experienced that, how do you. How do you talk to folks about that? How do you explain that notion of your role as a board member? As opposed to what they expect you to be and do, Andrew.

H: This disconnect has been my biggest surprise after getting on the board. And I'll. I'll tell a quick example. Two weeks after I got on the board five years ago ago, I got a call from somebody who I'd known, who had shown up at my events, who'd supported me, and he said, I need your help. Great. What can I do for you? I need you to fire my grandson. Second, he was not kidding.

I can connect you. You know, you need to go to your principal, whatever. That man has never spoken to me.

start time: 2244:40:46.000
end time: 2251:41:52.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Because, Jim, I hear what you're saying, but I have been trying this when we. Let's just talk openly about the strike, right? What the community's thought process was for, what our role as board members was in that strike was absolutely not our role either meeting up during or after. But we are not going to convince them differently. And I think that. And again, this. This is a bit of an issue I have with council Grant city schools, because I was like, oh, you got to explain your role as a board member. That is not what the public thinks we do, and it's not what they think we should do.

start time: 2251:43:36.000

E: Right.

start time: 2251:48:40.000
end time: 2256:47:46.000
confidence: 0.95
H: So I think the hardest thing about being a board member is being aware of the governance and being willing. And I don't disagree that we should try, like, keep trying, stay optimistic, but, like, just recognize that a huge swath of the public are just going to say, nope, that's not your job. Your job is to get in and fix the problem in my school. That is why I supported you. That's what I want to see you do.

start time: 2256:48:58.000
end time: 2259:25:06.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah, Understood. Understood. Gentle ways of redirecting. And in some instances, they never speak to you again when. When they realize you can't fire or.

start time: 2259:26:18.000
end time: 2260:51:14.000
confidence: 0.93
H: And I think we need to recognize good governance does not necessarily read to lead to reelection. That's.

start time: 2260:52:02.000
end time: 2273:02:16.000
confidence: 0.97
B: That's. We had one board member who always said when issues would come up, she said, you know, I wasn't really happy about principle. You put at Jones and he didn't stay there. But I understand that's that I am governance and that's below the line. She always said that's below the line. That's operation. So she's making a statement, sort of a subliminal message to get to her constituents. And she never lost a reelection. They always thought she was cheering in their corner. But she would count your comments on. I just want to say I understand that's governance, that we are governing body and that's below the line. But I was just very disappointed to see the blank, blank, blank happen to the Jones High School principal. I was going to make you the last speaker. So it's time.

confidence: 0.96
C: What Andrew is saying, I wonder, and this isn't like calling anyone out. I think it's more, more about creating the space to call in. Like, I wonder about how much of that kind of falls on me, Superintendent, in the way in which I'm representing community, the board and others. Because I, I think that there's a disconnect. And I think when like I just recently I shared with the board, like over four days I met with 60 principals and they shared their experiences and some of their concerns. And it was, I mean it sat with me for multiple days after, like, I was like, wow, I, I did not know some of the things that they elevated was so pronounced. And you know, having served in the district, I didn't know to that degree that we had some little fires in different parts of our city. And so I guess I just wonder like when you know that that question on, I mean I get like, okay, this is specifically focused on a second grade teacher, but when some of the concerns of broader are raised about the state of schools and what's happening in classrooms and it doesn't then translate to at least some type of like action and movement or at least some communication piece for the those who are in operations. I think it indirectly communicates that, you know, there's no movement, there's no influence. And so like I understand, I mean I appreciate the lanes and all that and I also understand that we have some communities who are experiencing some small little fires and are looking to elevate their voice in a way that they're. It leads to some action. And so I feel like there is, I think there's opportunities and one on ones and other meeting structures where, you know, I can be brought in if I don't already know what's happening. I can be brought into what's happening because there are a lot of secrets.

start time: 2316:01:24.000
end time: 2335:35:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: But you know what, that's a critical point though because I think as board members get feedback from their constituents, part of their response is. So that's a detail level that I'm not responsible for. But I can promise you I'm going to share this with the superintendent and she'll have someone get back with you. It's such an egregious concern. She'll have one of her area superintendents or someone get back in touch with you. And then the one on one with the superintendent says, hey, I know this may just be a one chance, a one time deal. Just wanted to make you aware of it. You need to at least look into it. There are repeated concerns and complaints about the same second grade teacher. There's a fire, you say, Kimberly, there's a fire going on over here. Could you please look into it? Because I've got 12 different calls saying fire the second grade teacher. Can you at least assure me somebody's looking into it? Somebody's observing in a classroom. If it's really egregious like they say she's her hurting children, doing something physically aggressive toward children, then that certainly calls for a different response altogether. But assuring the constituency that you're getting it to the right place for something to be done about it. And then, Kimberly, making sure somebody is getting back with that parent over their concern as well. It's a good landing spot. Yes.

start time: 2335:44:10.000
end time: 2339:36:36.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Just to connect that. Sorry, just really quick, Jim. Just to then connect that. Then that, that gentleman that brought forth that concern. You know, if there was a conversation, a phone call, a sit down, if not me, someone on the team, and then even a follow up.

start time: 2339:37:48.000

end time: 2346:21:06.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah, yeah. He might feel like, okay, while he couldn't, you know, be directly involved, he triggered the people. And I think some people are concerned about like I don't want to send the superintendent in all different directions. And then when we talk about the true colors, like I want to be involved in the discussion, I'm, I'm responding. I'm getting out in the field.

start time: 2346:22:18.000
end time: 2349:03:46.000
confidence: 0.90
B: And so because if you don't get the information, you can't identify trends and issues and small fires that are. Yes. Brewing. You're going to say something, Michelle.

end time: 2361:17:46.000
confidence: 0.98
D: I was, I was going to say in my one on one conversations with families, with teachers. A lot of my conversations that are one on one are like, this is. I appreciate the concern. I'm willing to listen to anybody. But a lot of my correction or my conversation has to do with saying that's not something a board member does. I can elevate the issue, but I can't fix it. Like just for instance, hearing from a family that wanted to take their kids out of a neighborhood school because the principal was walking around like a queen, I was like, well, I can listen to that. That's not something I can directly influence.

confidence: 0.97
E: And mine was just going to be an amen to what Kimberly said, which is good governance is a two way street, right. That we literally set it up as a roadmap. Right. And the governance part on the part of the board and staying above that line is important for the district to work well and to operate efficiently and effectively. But on the other side of that road, issues that are raised and concerns that are brought to bear have to be addressed by the folks who manage the district day to day, by the folks who are in the operations. And that is what makes it functional, is to make sure that, yes, that's not the role of the board member, but when those issues and concerns are raised, it has to be addressed by the superintendent, by the leadership, by the district and those systems. Systemic issues, or even those smaller issues that you don't want the board micromanaging, but they still have to be addressed. They still have to be worked through. And the folks who are stakeholders in the system need to understand that those issues are being addressed and being addressed. You know, maybe some action or it may just be responding, but it has to, there has to be some response to that. And that's. There's a responsibility on both the part of the board and on the part of the leadership.

Like they change schools and they, I need to have a back transfer this school. And it could have been like, that's not my job. Instead I said like, have you like actually applied to transfer? Because I wasn't clear, like, hey, you as a board member can get my kid into that school.

F: So I just asked that question and it turns out like they had and they all got resolved. But if I just Said that's not my. My job. Versus like this is the directing them back to the process. They ended up getting a response from enrollment and transfer which is where they should. And I don't know why they kind of me but it was like that's the place you can go. And versus if I said that's not my job then I think it would have just made it more antagonistic.

Grab your lunch, start eating, and we'll start reconvening around 1215, if not sooner. If I hear the conversation levels start to wane, we'll start a little bit sooner. Give us some extra time.

I don't have a problem trying new things, which that is true. Don't have a problem just jumping into it. Things changing. I'm. I'm good with all of that. I think it's no secret that I prefer relationships over. Over things. Relationship is king in my life. It always has been. I'm pretty sure that it will be. I'll lose money for a relationship because I'd rather keep the relationship and because I can always get money. I can always get money. But will I always be able to keep that relationship? Gold was. I think it was third because I. I am loyal to the soil. Like I believe in loyalty. It is what it is. I don't really. Some of the other ones that were in there I really wasn't a fan of because it says respects rules and authority. Maybe, maybe. Maybe. Yeah, that's it. That's the supreme. That's what it is. And so maybe that's it. And maybe that's why that was there. Responsible Am I. I don't know. Because I'm willing to try pretty much everything. And is that really responsible? I don't know. Organized. That's the most organized thing in my life right now is that what I've learned is the power of an administrative assistant. I got an administrative assistant about a year and a half ago of my own with outside like for church stuff in my. And it has changed my life. It has changed my life. I get text messages every morning that tells me this is your schedule for today. I get some phone call reminders to say you have an appointment at. At this time. And a reminder. It has changed my. My absolute life. I've given up access to my email. I've given up all passwords, my. She reads my emails. She filters out for me what's junk and then what's what's not. And she's created a whole separate group that I get to go into where I can actually read those emails. And they matter. The other ones, I. If it doesn't make it to this group, it didn't matter. It is beautiful. So I am working on that. So I believe I'm getting organized because in order to do the level of work that I do in the spaces where I do those things, organization is necessary. So I respect that. And green. Yeah, I wasn't. I wasn't feeling that at all. Except for independent thinker. Because some of the questions I didn't really. I wasn't really a fan of. It was just. I don't care how other people necessarily. I'm not bent on how other people see me because I'm not called to see for me. I'm not called to. To just please people. I'm called to change and transform people. So whether. If you just. If I'm doing stuff to be liked by people, then I may change what. What I'm supposed to be doing because I want to be liked. I don't care if people like me. That's. That's in my world, you liking me is irrelevant. I'm called to change and transforms lives, not be liked by, by people. Because when you, when you make significant change, sometimes they don't like what you're doing because you have to go against what they believe should be done. So I don't really care about being like, you will respect me. You. I, I do. I use, I give it. I'm not going to disrespect anyone. So I, I will call people on the carpet if I feel like they're being disrespectful. And I do believe, like my grandmother would say, you get it where you gave it. So if you act a fool in the grocery store with my, when my grandmother was alive, you act full in the grocery store. There's no bigger fool than her. She wear your tail out all up and down the aisles of that grocery store. She ain't waiting till she get to the car. Ain't gonna be none of that. You get it where you gave it and you stop, learn. You learn real quick. Don't give it to her there because she gonna give it right back. And so if you act a fool with me in a general setting, trust and believe that I'm gonna give it right back to you, but I'm gonna do it. I'm like rude. I'm not gonna be like crazy, not gonna be way out there. Because there's a way to say things and there's a way to do things. You know, say all things are lawful but not expedient. So it may not be the right time or. But I'm gonna give it to you.

B: That's an excellent point. So I want to kind of bring that to a closure because you just nailed what I was going to say. The whole issue around psychological testing and the styles is that you understand the way you function and also the way your function and the intent behind it was to maximize the application of that to make the most productive workplace, which is the board's workplace. And then also I read this summary to them. Each color is associated with certain personality traits. But everyone has some degree of all of the colors. You usually have one dominant and one secondary. Remember, there are variations, blends. It's not purely scientific, but if you take the assessment again in 30, say 60 days, 90 to 95% of the time, your colors will come out the same. Pretty, pretty consistent. Encourage you to do that. I left an extra copy on everyone's place setting in case you want to try it out on spouse, partner, friend, co worker. We had Extra copies that Roseanne had actually made for us. I put an extra on each of your work. Did you see the places?

B: He did. He read through all. He did. Oh, he did all of it during lunch. He barely had time to eat because it's so studious. I want to thank you for that as well. Again, the. The whole point behind it is knowing other personality traits helps you to appreciate the way they think and process and also helps you. That tip sheet helps you be able to better communicate with them for a more coherent board. And we actually spoke earlier, Herman, about the notion of coherence system, systematic, logical connection, consistency for diverse elements, relationships and values. So though the board may have different personalities, different values, because there's this moral imperative, everyone who spoke to it was about helping children learn and succeed in life. Life. That moral imperative helps us to make the emotional connection to say we're going to work together like Steve Kerr gets a diverse talents and personalities to work together to win a championship. We're going to work together because we have that single moral imperative that is our purpose. And we agree that even if we don't always agree, we're going to work together cohesively to make things, good things happen for children. All right, that's a good transition. Now we are back to Jim to talk more about governance.

So actually, if we go to the next slide here, I'm going to start where Barbara just left off, which is beautiful in terms of just the flow of our conversation. So can you all got it?

E: One, one too far. Good. So we're going to talk a little bit about. We're going to get more into the details of the governance relationship. Again, our purpose today is to continue to cultivate and reinforce a strong governance team that will lead to continued success and enhanced success for students ultimately. And if you see in the upper right hand Corner on slide 12, on slide 12, you see in the upper hand right hand corner all of these photos, almost exclusively, these photos of your children that they're taken from your Facebook page or Instagram So wanted to make sure you see yourself and your kids in all that we talk about today. So we're going to do, we're going to talk about research very briefly because we've talked a lot about it actually already. We've talked a lot about the issues that are defined in the research. We have surfaced many of the issues and challenges that come with this governance relationship. And also there's a surprising convergence of the research. And I'll show you what I mean by that. As you look at different, different studies and different pieces of scholarship around effective school boards, there is surprising unanimity around what that looks like. So we're going to talk about research. We're going to do a little bit of reflection around our, our current state in Portland Public Schools and the, the, the policies and the protocols that we have in place around the governance team, how the school board works together, how each of the members work together as a coherent whole, and how the school board works with the superintendent as a full governance team and how we can define the systems and habits and protocols that are going to help us to continue to move forward. But if we stay on that last slide. Real quickly, Barbara, I just want to highlight what, you know, this, this comes from Michael Fullen, who I'm a big fan of. And so when talking about governance systems and school boards working together, I love what it says. The, the vision, the, the goal, the dream is to have a school board and a superintendent working together as a cohesive, unified team with a common vision driven by a shared moral imperative. Exactly what, what Barbara was just talking about. So diving into the research a little bit and again, to just acknowledge you all have, this is not the start to the conversation about, about governance, about the governance team, about effective school boards and how they operate. You've had some of these conversations. You've been engaged in this dialogue. And so just to reinforce some of that, I want to walk you very quickly through some of the research. This is a piece of research from the National School Boards association. And if you want to just take a moment to read some of the key points of what effective school boards do. So, you know, things that, that we've talked about, commit to a shared vision, have strong shared beliefs about what's possible for students. Focus on accountability, create a collaborative relationship with the staff, community and the superintendent. Utilize data, align and sustain resources, take part in training and development and professional learning. And number seven, I think I highlighted here because I think it's really important and a great, again, a great framing of what effective school Boards do is they lead as a unified team with the superintendent, each from their respective roles with strong collaboration and mutual trust. Again, that's from the National School Boards Association. If we go to the next slide, some more research and I think you'll start to see what I mean about a surprising conversation convergence of the research. So this is from actually very Recent research from 2023 from the Journal of School Leadership. And this is factors associated with enhanced student achievement. When we, when we talk about effective school boards. And from this is from a piece called Effective Board Leadership. And again, what do effective school boards do? Create a vision, utilize data, set goals, monitor progress, create urgency, engage the community. I think this is important, connecting with this district leadership. So again, that's the conversation we're having. What does that relationship look like? How do we define that relationship? How do we make sure that that relationship is productive and there's good communication? And then, you know, a lot of the other things that, that I think you're really engaged in and excited about in terms of developing policy with a focus on student learning and demonstrating commitment and practicing unified governance. These are the factors associated with enhanced student achievement when school boards undertake these actions. Look at the next slide again. It's going to start to look really familiar. Right. This is from the Illinois association of School Boards. Here are the, what they call the foundational duties of effective governance. And the way they frame vision is that the district, the board clarifies the district purpose. So the board sets that vision. I really like the way they frame this in terms of an ongoing two way dialogue with the entire community. That's part of the role of an effective governance. Governance team, an effective school board, the board employs a superintendent. Right? The clear understanding of roles, responsibilities and expectations. And that's one of the most important things that you do. And one of the things that you have just done and done beautifully. You've hired a strong, effective, visionary leader to implement policy, to lead the district forward. And so one of the most important things that you do, you are just coming on the heels of doing absolutely, absolutely beautifully, monitor performance and take responsibility for itself. In terms of that, that, that, that sounds a little, I don't know, harsh or something like that. But when it's really just talking about being reflective and making sure that the board is accountable to itself, really creates clear policies and evaluates itself on a regular basis in terms of its own effectiveness. Love the picture. With all the kids and their hands raised. That's one of my favorites. There's a lot of other research around Effective school boards and effective governance teams. Some of this is a little bit more dated, but again, surprisingly consistent. One of my favorites is Marzano and Waters District leadership that works. Striking the right balance. And so those are some of some additional references, as in citations, as you, if you want to dig into some of that. But again, I think what you'll find is there is just this incredible convergence, is incredible alignment in the literature that just is reinforced time and time again by study after study about what it is that effective school boards do and effective governance teams do. Meaning the school board and the superintendent working together. Go to the next slide, please. And so this is just again, you'll hear the themes again and again. And I don't want to be redundant, but I want you to hear it and to make sure that we internalize the research so that we can have a great discussion about the specifics of Portland Public Schools and the way that you are structuring your work here. So this is a synthesis of all of those different studies that we looked at and more. And what you'll see is a great deal of, of overlap here. So school boards focus their work on policy and governments create a vision, hire a great superintendent and make sure that they hold that person accountable to the expectations they have set, define and refine policies that support student learning. I want to highlight this because what you don't necessarily see here is one of the real important priorities of this board, which is racial justice and equity. But this is where I think you do that in creating the vision, in setting the goals and in setting the defining the resources and how those resources are equitably allocated so that you can define success for all students. So I hope that you hear that priority is embedded in all of these pieces that the research says are so important. And as you think about your priorities as a board, your interests and where you want to go for the future, I recognize that's a really important aspect of the work in Portland and in many places, but particularly in Portland. And that's embedded in the synthesis of the school board research. Utilize data. So making sure that you're monitoring progress, culture of collaboration, engaging the community. And then I think this last one is really important and it is one of the most important things that a school board and superintendent can do together as a governance team is make sure that they keep the focus on what's important. So keeping the focus on high quality instruction and student learning. And there are lots of distractions, there are lots of things that you have to deal with that you have to grapple with that you have to address. But you. The most effective school boards and the most effective governance teams of boards and superintendents working together keep their eye on the prize of great instruction happening in every classroom every day and high level student learning so that kids can be successful. And where we sometimes worry or see concerns is when the urgent can sometimes squeeze out the importance. And effective school boards manage that balance where they keep their eyes on the important, they address the urgent, but they keep their eyes on what's important and make sure that they're moving in that direction and driving toward student success. So that's the synthesis of school board research. We're going to take a few minutes for you to digest that and to think about that and to reflect on that. And I guess what I would ask is if you would take a couple of minutes, maybe one, maybe 90 seconds or two minutes of sort of just individual think time around these reflection questions. So we're going to ask you where has our school board and our governance team, really our school board and superintendent together, been most strongly aligned with the research on effective school boards? In what ways has our school board acted inconsistently, if any, and maybe you haven't. And then are there policy structures, commitments or practices? Are there habits and systems that could bring our school board and our governance team in closer alignment with the effective school board's research? So we're going to give you a little bit of individual think time, maybe about two minutes, Barbara, for that. And then we'll put you. I'd love for you to be just in small groups, maybe twos and threes to talk through these questions in small groups. And then we can come back, maybe take about five or six minutes to do that. And then we can come back together as a whole group and digest and, and report out on those conversations. Okay. Yeah. Before we do that, any questions about the research, anything that, that struck you or anything that I need to clarify?

end time: 3750:42:40.000

start time: 3774:49:12.000
end time: 3780:00:20.000
confidence: 0.89

I don't know how you're going to get there. But I know when we. You're going to land at the Fred Meer on Interstate. That's a board governance. I'm determining this is the direction. This is the expected outcome. Was that.

I: The. The board goals. The board goals are around student achievement, the student focus. Start talking about the. The governance. The. The supposed to govern the direction that. This is where I see our district going. I want us to increase like this is where we're supposed to be at and where all students are. If we changed our goals to say that, you know, just black and brown but all students will be able to read at the affordable appropriate level five. Now that's the goal. That's the expected outcome. How we get there. I believe that's up to the superintendent, staff and everybody else like what that is. But we have set a clear goal and a clear expected outcome. So not they can but they will be able to read at the appropriate grade or high grade too. That's the goal. That's the expected outcome. I believe it's our job to set that as a board.

I: I believe that's us. That's not the superintendent. That's not the staff. We said that. I believe we get into the habit of. Of saying, well, what do you think? We ask too many questions where we should be providing direction.

I: And then if we, if we, if we play. So regardless of where it's at, if we play the role, to make sure that I take issue in the same direction, take the back to our responsibilities and respect somebody else. To me, that's a me. It's almost like I'm trying to escape. I will never escape accountability. Because if I define the goal and the expected result, this is what I'm expecting to see. If it doesn't, you know, I'm not going to say, well, stand up and say after. And it turns out it's not carefully monitoring because we look at every one of these and like, halfway through each one they say, monitor.

G: One thing we had for question two, and you guys didn't add in because I didn't write in everything everybody said. So one of the things we said was using urgency versus importance. I love that statement you said. As far as using urgency squeezes out importance. I think we do that a lot.

This is one that maybe is just me, but I think we lose sight of policy and governance, particularly around when it comes to some of our executive sessions and discipline that we tend to dive right into some.

confidence: 0.96
I: Now we're ready. We felt we spent a lot of time talking about the policy as far as like as a board, like we need to possibly look at. Relook at some of our policies. And then we talk. Then we as we talking about governance and we went down this rabbit trail. It's probably my fault because I started talking about the board and governance from a direction perspective and that a board should be providing the direction and talking about expected outcomes and then how that's done. The how is the job of the superintendent and the staff? And. And so we went down this road of when does that. When does that get in the way? Like when are we doing. When are we doing more than what we need to do and calling it governance? When it's not really governance, it's. It's something else. How do we. So I don't think we were saying that we need to do. We need to do better at that and figuring that out.

start time: 4045:05:34.000
end time: 4045:11:34.000

C: We.

start time: 4045:13:02.000
end time: 4047:47:18.000
confidence: 1.00
I: We also spoke that we don't our communication as a. From like both parties. Like how we talk to one another. We need to do a better job at communicating.

start time: 4047:48:54.000
end time: 4048:35:02.000

start time: 4048:36:46.000
end time: 4052:15:12.000
confidence: 0.96
I: And with the superintendent and the staff so that we're. We're understanding each other's heartbeat. We were really wanting to make sure that if we understand one another, then we know how to communicate with one another and we know how to work.

start time: 4052:15:36.000

start time: 4053:42:56.000
end time: 4056:32:58.000
confidence: 0.93
I: Versus just versus the operation and not. And governance is more than just looking at the policies because governance is more than just saying these are the policies.

start time: 4056:35:04.000
end time: 4063:55:54.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Governance is also direction what you expect versus the how. Got it. All right, question three. Jim's going to get on me for going over time. Question three, Succinctly. Are there policies, structures, mutual commitments, practices that could bring the school board into closer alignment with the effective school boards research? Volunteer to go first because Kimberly's going.

start time: 4069:41:06.000
end time: 4074:29:28.000
confidence: 0.95
C: And then I think utilize the one on one meeting structure to sunrise and sunset concerns, issues, thoughts, feelings, but allowing us to have the opportunity to be in conversation. So that board superintendent relationship, that's one on one.

start time: 4074:30:24.000
end time: 4076:49:00.000
confidence: 0.98
B: I think that's critical. I think that is critical. Certainly would have helped board member Garcia. Helped her tremendously. Anything else?

start time: 4077:45:20.000
end time: 4085:00:50.000
confidence: 0.97
I: All right, group two, we wanted to really look at our. Some of our policies are more than 20 years old and possibly even older and didn't take into consideration how it would impact students of color and marginalized students. So we really felt like if we as a board were to get that under control, that could really help to move our district into the direction.

start time: 4085:03:30.000
end time: 4086:30:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: A regular cadence of reviewing policies. If they're 20 years old, there's a good chance they need to be reviewed.

start time: 4086:33:20.000
end time: 4087:00:32.000
confidence: 0.80
F: To be reviewed every four years.

start time: 4087:02:16.000

B: Every four years. Just not happening.

start time: 4087:35:28.000
end time: 4087:57:00.000

D: Well, I think that.

start time: 4089:06:00.000
end time: 4089:23:40.000

F: Policy says.

start time: 4089:28:40.000
end time: 4090:27:40.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Which is another reason why the policy needs to be reviewed, which is why.

start time: 4090:36:40.000
end time: 4102:06:48.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I want to talk about the point that you made though, about why we should review it. We've. We've undergone as a community this understanding about racial equity and how outcomes are predictable by race in our district. So there's been this focus for the last. I don't know, probably, you know, more Julia, what the focus has been. But that's why. Is because some of our policies were written before we even had a very diverse board. And in our demographics in the district have changed as well. So it's. I mean, I think for that reason that would be why I would want to see us like literally going through. And also I think a lot of our policy, to Andrew's point are they're kind of operational, not really student necessarily student outcome focused.

start time: 4102:09:44.000
end time: 4103:40:40.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So policies less operational and more current with the community's needs.

start time: 4103:42:40.000
end time: 4103:50:00.000
confidence: 0.76
D: Yes.

start time: 4103:51:20.000
end time: 4111:44:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: And the community's keeping pace with. Do you know, Michelle, that's happened across the country where. Yes, it has one way 10 years ago. And then the socioeconomic status has shifted, the demographics, the ethnicity has shifted the el population, children who are learning English. All of those things have shifted and need to be considered in policy revisions. It is getting hot in here again. Something talk to somebody because lunch on top of heat.

start time: 4111:51:20.000
end time: 4112:11:12.000

I: Yeah, the itis.

start time: 4114:03:28.000
end time: 4115:25:22.000

B: Okay, last group, last question.

start time: 4115:27:06.000
end time: 4117:46:58.000
confidence: 0.87
G: All right, so we had focusing on student achievement. We get away from that a lot of times.

start time: 4117:49:14.000
end time: 4118:35:50.000
confidence: 0.81
B: All other distractions focus on student achievement.

start time: 4118:52:10.000
end time: 4123:01:04.000
confidence: 0.93
G: We also talk about supporting the vision and policy that are set forth. So one of the things that we came up with was when, like, the state gives us unfunded mandates and us not doing the same thing when we're doing our policies and our vision.

start time: 4123:03:12.000
end time: 4124:02:20.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Unfunded mandates passed down to the administration. Got it.

start time: 4124:19:20.000
end time: 4126:51:00.000
confidence: 0.94
G: Having our strategic plan aligned with our core goals. It was always my understanding that our. The strategic plan should be the way of how we get to our goals.

start time: 4127:22:00.000
end time: 4128:25:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: That sounds more complicated than it has to be. So I'm glad you brought that up.

start time: 4128:27:20.000
end time: 4131:43:10.000
confidence: 0.95
G: And then how did our strategic plan talk about outcomes that are achievable through the strategic plan and then also finishing goals before we start new ones?

start time: 4132:30:10.000
end time: 4133:52:10.000
confidence: 0.80
F: Yeah. So the other then would be meeting our evaluating for our superintendent and board in place.

start time: 4133:54:10.000
end time: 4134:49:10.000
confidence: 0.99

start time: 4137:08:12.000
end time: 4141:09:40.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Well, some board meetings, there's, like, really no board work. It's just like being. It's not all what Jim said. Like, it's a conversation between the superintendent and the board members. A lot of times it's like just a report. Like, a lot of reporting or board members sitting there listening.

start time: 4141:11:00.000
end time: 4143:07:16.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Okay, so more interactive actual board work taking place around, like, our work around the work.

end time: 4145:16:24.000
confidence: 0.93
F: I mean, it's like we're there. It's important to hear from the community and everybody else, but it's also our one opportunity to do board work.

start time: 4145:17:52.000
end time: 4149:35:36.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Board work around policies and outcomes and data, et cetera. There's some ways to help with that focus as well. Anything else on the three questions? Let me hear from my scribe on the last two to make sure. Number three. To make sure we captured it.

start time: 4149:36:48.000
end time: 4156:36:30.000
confidence: 0.86
F: Number three. I have habit systems and communication protocols. Outdated policies that impact marginalized students. Focus on student achievement. Strategic plan aligns report goals. A strategic plan that aligns with work goals and they are achievable resourcing policies. Summarize that evaluation. Superintendent board online.

end time: 4174:47:10.000
confidence: 0.86
F: The development and the strategic plan and then monitor it. Should the board be connected to goals, stay focused on what is important. There's a need for cultural acceleration that accountability becomes feels tuned, distracted by operational issues, policies that seem more operational community or.

end time: 4180:35:20.000
confidence: 0.88
F: You're gonna. Somebody talking that up. So we'll get it, of course, because.

start time: 4180:38:10.000
end time: 4181:49:16.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Thank you, scribe. Roseanne did a wonderful job of capturing that. Jim, back to you.

start time: 4181:51:48.000
end time: 4205:07:00.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Yeah. So thank you. That was beautiful. And I mean, I. I think just really captured a lot of important information here. I want to elevate two things before we move to our next steps. One is the conversation that has arisen a couple of times about the board goals versus the strategic plan. And I know that Portland has had a long tradition of having board goals that are. That are maybe separate from or different from the strategic plan. But I wonder if it might be valuable to reconsider that, to think about if the board goals and the strategic plan should not at a minimum be aligned, but maybe even be the same. I mean, maybe even be the. A strategic plan. When I look at your board goals, they're very much focused on racial equity. They're very much focused on student learning outcomes. And I would imagine as you go into a new strategic planning process, whatever strategic plan you're going to develop is going to be very focused on those priorities as well. So I guess I would love to hear Barbara's thoughts on that, but I would love to. I think I would encourage you to think about whether board goals and strategic district strategic plan need to be separate things, whether they need to be aligned together or whether they need to be one on the same. And what works best for you all in that regard.

start time: 4205:14:00.000

B: Andrew.

start time: 4205:27:28.000
end time: 4211:09:22.000
confidence: 0.95
H: So it's a great conversation. Kimberly, I think had to leave the room for a second. So I also want to make sure we don't have too much of it without her here, because I think this is essential. I'm going to speak. I want to put a little finer point on what I think the problem is, because I want to. I think if Guadalupe were in the room, he would say, Jim, oh, absolutely. That strategic plan is aligned with those goals. The board set the goals. I developed a strategic plan to do all those things.

start time: 4211:11:06.000
end time: 4211:20:34.000
confidence: 0.75
B: And it's.

start time: 4211:21:22.000
end time: 4216:19:14.000
confidence: 0.96
H: It's 100% aligned. In fact, he has said that to us multiple times where the real debate was that I think we should Talk about and really get on the same page with our new superintendent is he viewed the strategic plan as an operational document and operational item. And he said, you're going to monitor the board goals. I'm going to monitor plan. Board members said, but we want to.

start time: 4216:19:22.000
end time: 4216:27:30.000
confidence: 1.00
B: See what's going on.

start time: 4216:28:10.000
end time: 4217:19:00.000
confidence: 0.82
H: Strategic plan to. And Guadalupe was pretty clear. He's like, that's not your.

start time: 4217:19:30.000
end time: 4217:24:00.000
confidence: 0.87
E: Your role.

start time: 4217:24:40.000
end time: 4227:27:38.000
confidence: 0.97
H: That's not your lane. I'm going to do that. And board members said, well, well, could we get some metrics or reporting? And he was not willing to do it. And I'm again, we could maybe call Guadalupe. I don't want to speak too much for him, but what he had expressed at the time was a concern that the board was going to weaponize that reporting in a way district. So I want to just put that on the table flat out because I think it is a really important conversation. You're highlighting, Jim, that as a board with our new superintendent, then we need to be very clear, where are the lanes? What's the reporting? What's the structure? Because I think there's a different way that we can do it that still keeps us governance and operations. But I don't know exactly where that line is.

start time: 4227:29:54.000
end time: 4233:17:52.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Let me speak to that because I know I was one of the ones that asked for metrics and metrics of the strategic plan of outcomes. And that actually came from the Harvard Institute when they actually talked about doing strategic plans and having outcomes and matrix aligned with that. And the one at Guadalupe made him talk about it. Didn't have those. And that's what I was asking for. Now, I don't know why. I don't know as far as they.

start time: 4233:18:16.000
end time: 4233:31:44.000
confidence: 1.00
H: Did not have those.

start time: 4233:33:12.000
end time: 4247:00:18.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Did not have those. Right. And so I don't know about the weaponizing piece, but it still goes to the same thing I was talking about as far as how as a board, do we know where we're, where we're going and how we know how we're getting there? So for instance, if we say, okay, let's go from here to Seattle, right? Well, at this point we should probably be in Tacoma, right? At this point we probably should be at C. That's kind of all what I'm looking for is like, so because Australia, right. I guess just more looking at based on what we're talking about. How do I know we're getting there? Because I'm not in education. So, you know, for me it's. It's very detailed pieces that I just want to know. To know, okay, this is so I Know how we are getting there and what those looks like, you know, for me.

start time: 4247:01:14.000

E: Yeah.

start time: 4247:17:30.000
end time: 4248:12:02.000
confidence: 0.90
B: And I would say, oh, sorry, go, Jim.

start time: 4248:14:26.000
end time: 4269:13:04.000
confidence: 0.96
E: No, I guess what I would say is there's probably no one that is more protective of sort of the prerogatives of the superintendent. But I think there's a great value in having a single unified plan and set of goals for the school system, for the board, and really for the community about what our aspirations are and our expectations are for kids. So, again, we don't have to resolve that today, but I think that's an important conversation for you and Kimberly to have together around what that might look like. Because I think when it is, when it's just a superintendent's plan, then all of the accountability and all of the responsibility falls to the superintendent. When it's the. When it's the collective strategic plan of the community and the. And the board adopts it and the superintendent recommends it and it's a collaborative effort, then everyone has accountability to it. Everyone has responsibility for it. It's the community's plan for what we're going to do for kids. And I think there's power and value in that. And again, that's a conversation that you all can have and figure out. And Kimberly may have strong opinions and thoughts on that, but I think there's value in that.

end time: 4272:40:42.000
confidence: 0.92
H: I think there is a. There is. There's a place we can be here where, like, it's also our job as a board. Even if we're requiring the superintendent to provide regular updates on the strategic plan, that doesn't necessarily need to take action on that.

G: Yeah, no, absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that's what exactly what I'm talking about. Right. It's not showing, hey, how we're going. It was a good example when I learned, when I was on the last board is all we put to say is just, I need you to get here. I just need to know how do we know we're getting there? Right. Yeah, there's going to always. You have to pivot, turn, stops, bathroom breaks. Right, whatever. But if I don't know where we're. How we're supposed to get to where we're going, I have no way of evaluating if we're doing the job we're supposed to be doing. Right. And I guess that for me, it was just like, okay, because if. And for me, at the end of the day, if you just say our more goals is 5% growth and such, and that's all I see is, I don't know. Okay, we should be here, we should be there, but we don't get the fight. That's the only thing I have to evaluate on. Well, you didn't get 5% because I have no other matrix to say. Okay, well, we got 1.3 here, one and a half here, and we're on the right road to get there. And I can say, okay, at least we're making improvements. And not just have to say, oh, well, you didn't get five particulars. That's the only thing I have to go.

B: I love the analogy of you're on a road trip. Kind of want to know why are we stopping? What happened? Is there a problem here? Oh, so and so needed to stop for the restroom. Everybody's aware. Any divergence from the route. There's a why behind it. There's an explanation. I think that's critical. I also love the notion that if everybody in the back seat's given directions. Yeah, turn here, go left, go right. That's a crash that is certainly not going to get you to your destination in a healthy position at least. And so I think that's critical as well. So there has to be a level of trust to the driver. Got to be a certain level of trust. But you trust but verify. Like Kim, how many more minutes until we get to Santa Fe? Because this looks like it's really off. So just tell us now, just tell us now if we're going to be a little bit delayed. Here's what I think a really good scenario is and this board has come to that conclusion. It won't be decided here. There's a good possibility that at the board level, the vision, the mission, the purpose, all of that is agreed upon and it is a co owned strategic plan, which means the board also helps look at the SWOT analysis and at the data. Everybody's aware of it and the board comes up with the big buckets. These are the five things we're focusing on is what our budget and everything. This is what's important to us. And then the individual objectives that are measurable. Smart goals and measurables. People like to use goals and objectives interchangeably. It's whatever language you prefer. That level of detail falls to the CEO, to the superintendent, but she reports back to the board. Here's what's going on with the big buckets that you gave me. Here are the individual little tiny measurable objectives and here's where we are. Whether it's monthly, quarterly, what have you. I think a co owned strategic plan. And I love what Jim said about the community. If you roll out, not that you're going to have just a melee of people telling you the strategic plan, but you roll out the big buckets and here's what we believe we ought to be doing as a district for our children. And you ask the community the question, either in rollout meetings or digitally or online, have we covered it? Are we missing anything? Do you agree this is where we ought to be headed so that it feels like it's co owned by the community as well. Not from, trust me, not from square one. Tell us what our strategic plan ought to be because that's a Melanie but it's kind of what we're thinking where we've been drafting and we want your feedback in case we've missed anything. Then it feels like a co owned, not just superintendent and board, although that is critical. It feels like there's some co ownership with the community as large because here's what happens in public education. New superintendent comes on, they do this and learning tour. They put together their strategic plan. It's not co owned by the board. So if there's a transition, it all goes out the window. The next person comes along, they start from square one again. If it is co owned, board members step on and off. But the community has sort of not rubber stamped, has stamped their approval on the strategic plan. And regardless of who gets off and on the train, it keeps moving in a pretty consistent direction because everyone has agreed this is what we ought to be focusing on. And I love the analogy of public education is so demanding. This is trained, trying to make it up the side of a Mountain with 44,000 students on board. We had 207,000 students trying to make it up the side of that mountain. Just when you start getting some momentum, you think, oh my gosh, we're going to make it. Stop the train. There's two board members step off, two new ones step on. If one of them is Garcia, who hasn't had any orientation or onboarding, that train is going to stall for a minute. It will stall. And then you got to start picking up again, trying to get the momentum to make it up the side. Stop the train again, by the way, because the state just changed all of their accountability measures. You get so close to that field goal or to that touchdown and they move the goal. That's what happens in Florida.

And the reason why I want to say that is because I remember a couple years ago, sitting in space and I would see people get up and you can tell like something's going on. And I'm thinking, I have a son sitting in a classroom and I want to know, like, is his school under attack or anything that's happening. So I know that we have board members who are parents, and so we're trying to see if we can call for a quick executive session to solve a bargaining issue. But it's not a student safety issue. And I think I just, I know this is sort of out of the protocol, but I want you all to know that if I'm ever pulled away and it's something to deal with student safety, you guys would know what me, media.

F: A fine point on the board goals. And that what I thought was the superintendent's strategic plan is to me, they. I felt by them calling them the board goals and not being the goals of the strategic plan, it was like, that's the board's thing. And then there's this other thing. This is superintendent.

confidence: 0.95
F: And they weren't aligned. And frankly, like, you know, the board's goals weren't being met. And it's like, is that the reason? And so I. I do think a critical piece is, like, getting clarity on, like, you know, whose goals are they? Are they all are our goals or. And whose plan is it and what in. Within the plan? What is everybody's role? But I. I always felt when there was a statement of, like, you know, forward together, it's like, oh, we're like, who's that? You know, together.

B: Right. And in full disclosure, I know Guadalupe interacted with him a few times. Council, great city schools. We were on the board together. But I would not hesitate telling him on this particular issue, we disagree. But he was a superintendent. Then your discussion has to be certainly with your new superintendent. But I think there's a way to have more clarity and coherence, because what you described doesn't sound coherent. Separate the two intentionally. And if a CEO is saying, I'm not going to report to you on my strategic plan. You just stick to your goals. It doesn't sound coherent. And so the best measure of getting everybody moving in the same direction for the good of students, for the best student outcomes is a more coherent version. And so I'm going to put a note up in the parking lot. Roseanne, I'm not going to make you get.

confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah. Last thing I would say on that, Barbara, is that sense of collective accountability can be powerful in terms of, you know, it's all our plan. Right. So the board has a role in setting policies and division, setting policy, allocating the resources, appropriating the resources that we need to. To meet the strategic plan goals. And then, of course, of course, the superintendent and the leadership manage and move and drive toward that. And it's. I would just to address one of the concerns that was raised. It's hard to weaponize a strategic plan when it's our strategic plan, not your strategic plan or my strategic plan. So it's. We. We, you know, an opportunity to. To come together, maybe to. To really enhance and build trust and work together toward that. Barbara, I know you want to take a break, but real quick before that, my second observation. Oh, sorry.

A: Yeah, I just. Was just. Just a question for. Possibly for later is I'm assuming you probably have some templates or roadmaps for like how the. How. Right. How to create community buy in and everybody buy in. Right. Because, I mean, that just seems like a. It's a big lift, especially when most of us identified as, like, communicating with the community is one of our deficits.

start time: 4464:24:48.000
end time: 4482:42:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Absolutely. Absolutely. There are some vehicles that can be used. For example, I mentioned the rollout. It does not start from bare bones saying, tell us. It says, we've looked at our data, we've done a SWOT analysis. We think these are the big areas we ought to be focusing on. Rolling it out to the community is more along the lines of, tell us what we're missing. Is there anything else? Can you come up with something that we are not covering because we want to hear from you? And then once that opportunity has been given, then you have more buy in from the community. While it was in draft, everybody had a chance to weigh in. And there are ways to get around that. Through different community meetings, in each board member's district, electronically, on your website, weigh in, add anything that we've missed. You have to be prepared. Some people put crazy things in when it's social media, but you put it out there anyway. Everybody's had an opportunity. Then you have a chance to say, this is our now co owned board, superintendent, community. This is our strategic plan for our students that moves on people going off and on the board for the next five years.

start time: 4482:55:30.000
end time: 4485:18:34.000
confidence: 0.92

end time: 4485:26:34.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Right.

start time: 4485:28:02.000
end time: 4487:09:58.000
confidence: 0.91
F: I mean, vision, all sorts of people meeting and coming up with this strategic plan. And we still have that same plan.

start time: 4487:12:14.000
end time: 4487:34:14.000

start time: 4487:35:42.000
end time: 4492:15:30.000
confidence: 0.98
C: And we still have priorities anchored in that plan. I mean, our work streams, the big rocks that the team is working on. Yeah, there are some things that need to be operationalized, but much of our core work is still grounded heavily into the strategic plan.

start time: 4492:36:30.000
end time: 4509:55:58.000
confidence: 0.97
I: The only issue I had with that was that we would bring up, when we would talk about it, we would say, I know we didn't meet these board goals, but we are moving closer to our strategic plan. To me, that made it sound different. Right. And so that, and I'm all for having one, because when you got multiple, like, it's like, how do I choose where I'm at? So I have no problem with us, you know, in my, you know, my humble opinion, getting something that's succinct, where we can all be in line. I do want to, I do want to be careful to make sure that we don't, we don't lose sight of what we all said was a value, which is ensuring that our, our students, our kids are actually getting the high proficient level of education or whatever it was that we put in our vision. The vision statement that they're actually, they're actually getting that and that we're not sacrificing that for alignment, I can almost.

confidence: 0.96
B: Assure you, Herman, if you started from scratch trying to say, what is it we believe in? You've got a moral imperative that most of you have already spoken to. A commitment to coherence helps drive that focus of the vision and the purpose of the mission. You can almost guarantee you, if you had to name five or six buckets, most of you could probably name them now, but it's going through the process so that everybody's in agreement. These are our big buckets. That's where you want the superintendent to focus her time. And when you ask the community, if you actually go through, should you go through an exercise like that, when you ask a community if they come up with something additional beyond your five, six buckets, I just keep saying that number because it resonates with me. But if they come up with Something that you've not covered in those five or six buckets, chances are you'd be able to say, glad you brought that up. That fits under bucket number two. But the notion that you've asked and given folks an opportunity for input gives that feeling of co ownership, and there's certainly a way to get there. And I think five years, Honestly, Patty, I think that means it's a good time to be revisiting rebooting the strategic plan.

end time: 4534:53:50.000
confidence: 0.96
H: I want to actually, I want to concentrate on that for a second because I want to make sure we're being clear or if we're not in alignment, as opposed board, that the superintendent hears that. That one of the things in the hiring process we were pretty clear on as what I thought is that we are not looking for a superintendent who's going to come in and redo the vision and strategic plan. We felt like there's a very strong vision. We've set strong board goals. The superintendent had a good strategic plan, which, by the way, we all have.

H: Okay. I mean, because just there was. There's been a ton of work, and I think one of the challenges. And it's back to your train analogy. We have a new superintendent. I don't want the train to stall because all of a sudden the superintendent says, ooh, the board wants me to do a new strategic plan and new vision. And I got to put this whole. All this structure in place.

H: We're going to spend two years getting back to 90% of what's there. I do want the new superintendent to take a look at that strategic plan and say, all right, what's really been working well? What's not been working well, to your point, we have not been making progress on our student achievement goals, which means one of two things. It either means we need to change the things we're doing, or it means we need to give those things more time to work. And that's been the question we come back to again and again and again as a board that none of us know the answer to. But she and her team do. Right? It's the reason why we hire them is to say, what I need is another 12 months. What I need is another 24 months. Or what I need is your support to make some big changes. Because I think we need to do that.

end time: 4573:37:22.000
confidence: 0.94
B: And I want to. And I want to reassure you too, I didn't mean aside and start from scratch. A reboot or 2.0 of the plan probably means you start looking at the goal level and trying to merge. So you don't have a separate document of superintur goals versus strategic plan goals. So think of the actual goal level, but they're not that different. Strategic plan versus board goals. I think there's an opportunity to try to merge so everybody is behind the same set of goals, not redoing the vision and the mission. I love your mission statement on your website. It's incredible. But when you get to the goals level, is there an opportunity to try to merge so that one set of goals doesn't supersede another set of goals? I think there's opportunity there.

B: So from my perspective now, the board is not making a decision here. It's simply a discussion around is there an opportunity to try to merge at the goal level so they're not two separate documents that you're always jockeying back and forth with. Please don't think I meant reboot your entire strategic plan. We weren't gonna do that. No decision being made just to speak. Discussion. Yeah, I'm sorry. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead, Kimberly.

confidence: 0.96
C: I think the only question that lingers because I think I would say that for the most part there it is universal commitment and belief that the strategic plan is the right plan. There's some things that need to be operationalized. We're working on creating work plans to operationalize some of those items. So I do think that that is. Is our core work right now. I will say though, that there is a disconnect with staff with the board goals, and not that they're not not the right board goals. I think there's some question on the middle school readiness or 8th grade readiness, but that the amount the movement within the percentage point may be a little too aspirational is, I think, a belief that is held among staff. So I think at some point that will warrants another conversation. But I think there is universal understanding and belief that we, that, you know, the plan is the plan.

We need to support this way, this way, that way to be able to get us there.

C: Well I would say that's a great question and I love the way that Barbara opened about using the marathon analogy where it's like, okay, we're about to run 10 miles and all of the behaviors and actions and things that I'm doing isn't necessarily going to set me up to run the race. But even if I was doing all the right things, I can't expect that tomorrow. Today I say I want to run a 10 mile race and that tomorrow I'm going to be able to achieve it. Right. And so really calling out those specific actionable steps year to year because I think for some it's the, the board goals, it's like is it a, you know, three years we'll be there? Is it every year we should be there? And then of course all of the flurry from last year of none of the board goals being met and the ensuing impacts of that. So I don't know if that was clear or not, but basically I guess I would say that we're gonna, I think we're fairly, we're confident that we have the people in place and if we don't, that will be adjusted over the course of this year. But when we think of getting to the percentage of growth that we want, there's still a lot of work that we need to do at the foundation level to get that lift off. We're hopeful that, you know, hopefully there'll be a couple percentage growth that we'll be able to celebrate in the next couple of weeks, but certainly not the percentage that is indicated in the oracles, which would then make yet another year of not meeting them. So then at what point do we visit, like what percentage of growth is appropriate for us given this time? Or like what data are we using that says that for instance 7% growth, 6%.5% growth for all third graders in math is the right goal.

This was on a conference call national group yesterday around how do you solve to convince parents again, no, you really do need to come to school now. It's critical that you come to school because that has a direct impact on student outcomes as well. So pre pandemic and post pandemic and pre or post chronic absenteeism, something like 10% of our students are considered chronically absent at a national level. Chronically absent, which means they miss over a certain percentage of days because after the pandemic, parents and everyone else think, well, not that important to be there. It's okay, you can go online.

start time: 4664:35:58.000
end time: 4671:16:56.000
confidence: 0.96
I: It's literally two days chronic absenteeism. If you start breaking it down to a student level, because I I'm looking into it now, is if you miss more than two days, two days a month of school, not a week, but two days a month of school, you total that up and you are out of, you're out of alignment on the number amount of seat time you're supposed to have in school and you're chronically absent.

confidence: 0.94
C: Well, just to be clear. That too. Thank you for that. But in Portland, Right. We have two things that we're we're working through and that's the absenteeism, the rate of students which in some of our schools we have less than 70% on average daily attendance. And we also have a concern at the teacher level where we have a number of people because of policies who are not attending. So whether it's a student out of their seat or a teacher out of their classroom, our students are being doubly impacted. And that then you trigger right the if thens, if thens, if thens. And it just continues.

E: So sorry. I had two issues that I wanted to highlight and elevate from the conversation earlier. We just went through one and so sorry to take us on like a 40 minute tangent. But the other one is I think equally important, which is several people have note have noted the importance of keeping the focus on teaching and learning, keeping the focus on instruction and high quality student learning in the classroom. And I guess one of the things I want to just also offer for consideration is when we think about systems and habits, one of the greatest tools that you have is agenda setting for your school board meetings, how you structure your school board meetings and the agenda that you that you develop for those school board meetings. And so I wonder if it might be useful for the board and the superintendent to consider what might that look like? Probably not in the short term because you have a cadence of that for the coming year and agendas and things like that. And you also have things that you're required to do at certain times of the year. But I wonder if over the long term you might want to think about what how do we establish a discipline of keeping teaching and learning at the forefront of what's on our public agendas for school board meetings? For example, when I was in Knoxville, we had a discipline of having a mid month informational meeting which was a workshop. And so once a month or once every other month we would have a full, you know, school board workshop that focused exclusively on instructional, educational, teaching and learning issues and that required us as a governance team to focus on those issues on a regular basis. And we'd work with the board around, you know, what were some of the really important things that they wanted to hear about that were going on in the district, whether it was know, special education or career and technical education or, you know, just Instructional coaching, whatever it might be, but to keep that focus because it can, you know, it can. You can get mired in contracts and facilities and things of that nature pretty easily or, you know, some of the, you know, I mean, I think a great example is the strike. I mean, that was all consuming and took a lot of the oxygen out of the room. But if you, you know, develop sort of that cadence and that and that structure, that habit and that, that system of focusing on instruction on a regular basis, then you've built that into your system and you're. You're going to do it. So I would just offer that for consideration. And I don't know if anyone had thoughts or reactions to that, but something to think about. Another parking lot issue, probably. Barbara, to put up there to say, something to consider.

I'm not going to spend a ton of time on this because the next couple of slides, just because these are the statutory requirements and both the duties and the responsibilities of the school board. You know, these. They're built into your policies. They're. They're built into the structure. I will say, just on the statutes that empower school boards to do their work. I think there's some really nice language in here. Right. And it says school district boards have control over the district schools and are responsible for educating children residing in the district. So the overall umbrella idea is you all are responsible for educating kids in the district. And so setting that vision, setting those goals, holding people accountable who are in leadership to do that is a really important aspect of the work that you do. I'll go to the next slide. I am not going to go through this. These are the, the powers of the board. A surprising amount of them are focused on interscholastic athletics. But we're going to keep. Just keep moving.

E: Love athletics. Think it's wonderful. Great part of the experience. Anyway. Duties of the board. And so, you know, it talks about what. So you have both responsibilities, powers of the board and duties of the board. These are defined in statute. Your, Your board attorney can certainly speak more eloquently to this than I can. But these are just the statutory authority that you have as a board. I want to move quickly through that to the next slide, which begins to get to what does that look like on the ground in Portland with our school board here? And so we're going to take a couple of minutes to look at what I think are two really important foundational documents that you have developed and put together. And the first one is the one that says the role of the board. And I think this is a very, you know, it's a very brief policy. And I will point you just to one sentence in that policy, which I think is really important and good language. And it says, the board delegates executive supervisory and instructional functions to the superintendent, but shall retain full legislative authority over the schools in the district. That's very succinctly what we've been talking about for, like, the last three hours. So it's good language. Y'all have developed that nicely, and it's in your policies. Beyond that, I think the board has done a really nice job by adopting a resolution that really speaks to how the relationship, the governance team relationship, the relationship between and among the school board members and the relationship between the board and the superintendent is meant to play out. And I will say there's a lot of great language in here that I would really affirm and validate, and I really admire and appreciate what you've done here. So what I want to do over the next few minutes is. What I want to do over the next few minutes is just to. Yes, 6298. The resolution 6298 is to take a few moments for you to read through that. I know it's your, you know, essentially has the effect of policy for you. You all adopted this resolution in 2021. But I want to just re immerse ourselves in it and talk a little bit about if there is anything that needs to be refined or tweaked or added to. To this policy. And I recognize that we're actually on the far end of our time, and so we've got about an hour left. So we're not going to dig, probably be able to dig as deeply as we, as I hoped we would into specifics here, but at least hopefully surface some of the questions, some of the areas that might be useful to revisit or to refine going forward, and then that can be some future work for the board and the superintendent to work through together. So, Barbara, I think if folks have that in Their hands. It might be useful to take about five or six minutes just to enable everyone to read through it again. Familiarize yourself with this, with this resolution and then we can dig in to talk about some questions for reflection again which are on your slide that are showing. So I would suggest take about five or six minutes to read it. Take two or three minutes just for some, again some individual think time to answer these reflective questions that are on the slide. And then Barbara, if you would put folks in different small groups than the last time, we would have some more small group discussion around these reflective questions. And we do that for about five or six or I don't know. Barbara says seven minutes and it's, you know, 12. But well, you know, we'll, we'll sort.

So I just want to acknowledge that last year this time there was some conversation about making some modifications to this document. My understanding is that there was some discussion. I watched the school board meeting of, I think it was August 28th of last year and there was some good discussion, documented some of that. But that, that those that there wasn't action taken to actually formally adjust the document. So just want to give that as context. We can dig into some of those questions and conversations and revisit some of that from last year. But for the moment, my understanding is this is your working protocols around the, the board relationship and the board superintendent relationship.

Yeah, I mean, that was. So we had a lot of conversations. There is actually a draft somewhere. I'm sure Roseanne could pull it up that has. I'm pretty sure it's.

Anything missing, anything need to be adjusted. And here are your partners. Chair and the superintendent. Andrew and Gary, Julia and Herman. Patty and Michelle. You have, like, about four minutes.

end time: 5008:50:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: All right, roll it in. So the first question is just general for the entire group. The second question we will take report out for my scribe. Do these guidelines sound appropriate and comprehensive to you as a group? Let me hear your feedback on that. Do the guidelines seem appropriate and comprehensive?

start time: 5009:05:10.000
end time: 5010:38:10.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Well, I'll be honest. I didn't even get. I can't read that fast. So definitely comprehensive.

end time: 5015:06:00.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And I apologize for rushing you, but you have an executive session coming up, right. The more important question is, do you immediately see anything that's missing or that needs to be adjusted?

start time: 5015:38:20.000
end time: 5024:30:04.000
confidence: 0.92
G: Sorry. I think one of the things that we probably could add in here is some of the stuff that we're doing now. So, for instance, like when we do one board meeting a month and then a work session. Right. Maybe that we can add some of the stuff that we're doing now. Some of the times, you know, under B, where they're providing documents to board for reviewing the master meeting. But that has changed. We only doing one. So now it's like 14 days ahead of time. And you have so many days to respond and get your questions asked and all that stuff. I think we can add those stuff in here that we are starting to do now.

start time: 5024:31:32.000
end time: 5026:11:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Add some current practices in, such as getting the documents ahead of. So many days ahead of time. Yeah, okay.

start time: 5026:13:00.000
end time: 5029:05:40.000
confidence: 0.94
G: But then Andrew actually had a good comment. He said, you know, if. If we are talking about being student achievement focused, do we want to spend a lot of times on this board Protocol pieces.

start time: 5029:34:00.000
end time: 5029:58:40.000
confidence: 0.80
D: I mean, hear more about that.

start time: 5029:59:20.000
end time: 5038:18:42.000
confidence: 0.97
H: Yeah, because, I mean, I'm just, I'm having some reaction to this because when I was chair for a year, we spent a lot of time working with AJ Working with the board. I mean, you can go back to the document. There's a lot of changes. We had, again, multiple work sessions. In the end, not to get consensus right there, there wasn't a majority to adopt, like, all the different changes. There are pieces we probably could have gotten in. It just raises a question for me. I mean, it's going to be up to you and Michelle, but, you know, you could spend 10, 20, 30 hours. We can come together as a board for a couple different work sessions. But is that in furtherance of our student?

start time: 5038:19:46.000
end time: 5039:01:38.000
confidence: 0.94
B: You know, doesn't have to be that.

start time: 5039:03:54.000
end time: 5043:15:10.000
confidence: 0.94
H: Yeah, I mean, I think there are improvements here in terms of like information requests to the superintendent by individual board members. I think, you know, we don't have any way of putting people accountable for hearing these. I mean, there's other things we can do, but I'm not sure from a value add perspective, I'm spending a ton of time on this.

start time: 5043:43:30.000
end time: 5046:01:30.000
confidence: 0.96

confidence: 0.95
F: I mean, frankly, just to build off. Andrew's point is like, we've had.

confidence: 0.96
F: Talking about the. How we do our work, but frankly not actually having like, what is our work and how are we going to plan it out and do it. And then usually what happens in like March, it gets to be just a complete, like mad dash of activity because everything gets jammed in there. So from my perspective, I would rather be like at a high level. Is there anything that just like, isn't workable? Not. Let's like generally agree this is a, you know, an extend grace when needed, but focus on like, what is it that we agree is our essential work and plan that now because as soon as the new year starts, we've got on the superintendent. I mean, just the budget. It's just a whole host of things. And then I don't, I think then the urgent squeezes out the importance when we don't do that. So from my perspective, I would rather be like, generally, are there some things, some specific things we need to talk about, but not have multiple meetings about it without getting to like, what. What are, what are we trying to accomplish this year with the superintendent?

start time: 5068:30:10.000
end time: 5068:59:10.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Got it. Other thoughts?

start time: 5069:32:50.000
end time: 5069:39:06.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Yeah.

start time: 5069:39:38.000
end time: 5107:13:08.000
confidence: 0.95
A: One thing we, we talked about was probably that communication piece because one of the, one of the things that, you know, is very important is it's very true among, in public education in the United States, right? It's underfunded. We have too few people doing too many jobs. And so, you know, I always think about worst case scenario, you know, what if at one point the board goes crazy and all of sudden start emailing all the leadership team, you know, 30 questions. And then since the board is the boss's boss, there's, there's this feeling of obligation that, you know, they're going to drop all their work and do this. And so now if we're talking about affecting student outcomes, you know, if the leadership team suddenly doesn't have time to finish their work, that bleeds all the way down the system, right? People don't feel supported under them and so on. And so I guess one of the things I think would be nice is to clarify a direct path of communication. Like, for example, you know, we also need to identify, like, what are some issues, you know, because we're board members, but we're only, you know, I'm only one of seven board members, right? And so maybe what's important to me is important to no one else here. And the board is one unit. So. But if, but there might be something that I raised that could be important to three of us, right? Or three. And so that, that shouldn't have, we should have a system that naturally elevates things that are important to multiple board members and then things that maybe other board members just is not that important. It naturally maybe puts on the back burner because, you know, it's a, it's, it's a, you know, like a respect of time, right. And so, you know, one of the things, one idea maybe. So I don't know if we, you know, of course we're not making any decisions here with, you know, for example, like, you know, we have a board manager. Maybe all questions go to board manager and the chair and then CC the superintendent, right? Or, you know, like a system. And then that way we have a way to track all the questions. And so if there's patterns that are coming up, we can elevate those. And there's things that are just like, you know, is this, you know, like, for example, some questions may be relevant to achieving our board goals and some are not. And so how do we. It would be, it would be nice to have a discussion about how do we prioritize? Does that make sense?

start time: 5107:14:04.000
end time: 5113:22:42.000
confidence: 0.95
F: See, that's why I think it's important to decide what like our work, what our work is. Because the power of having like a framework or this, this is what our work is. It also allows you to say no to other things. And, but if there, if there's no like we haven't defined so then it's like well this is just randomly what I'm interested in. Or I don't know if I think.

start time: 5113:23:06.000
end time: 5113:43:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: If you have an agreement on like.

start time: 5113:44:10.000
end time: 5115:01:06.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Generally your framework then you'll know like there's three or four or the entire.

start time: 5115:01:38.000
end time: 5116:32:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Board interest which a co own strategic plan could kind of lead in that direction at the goal level.

start time: 5116:41:30.000
end time: 5129:57:28.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Right. So that to me that like having more definition about what our work is because for example, I mean I look at our work is like right now because we don't have like a word plan for the board. It's like it's our board meetings, like what am I going to be asked to vote on primarily or with what's within like the scope of the board members responsibility. And like that's where like most of my questions are. Because like without, in the absence of any other framework it's like oh well it's like somebody put something on the agenda and I want, I'm gonna have to vote on it. So I'm gonna you know, ask a question about it. I think this, the power of knowing what you're saying yes to allows you also to know what you're saying no.

start time: 5129:58:24.000
end time: 5130:43:36.000
confidence: 0.92
B: To use cases to keep the board focused.

confidence: 0.91
A: I feel like you're, you've got a great idea. I feel like you're almost assigning yourself some homework. Maybe come up with graph work, plan. Then it'll be again like just like policies. Right. It's nice to have a draft to start and start thinking about.

start time: 5134:44:40.000
end time: 5135:27:40.000
confidence: 0.91

D: Nicely delegated.

start time: 5136:49:20.000
end time: 5154:57:06.000
confidence: 0.97
B: The chair can delegate, but listen to this. What I think I hear you talking about in general is that the protocols think of them as guardrails as well. So we do what we should be focusing on and we stop doing or we not we don't get distracted by what is not our work. So protocols ought to be at a high level, guardrails simplified where possible and a level of efficiency so that we're not driving staff through 30 different priorities and questions. So some level of proficiency, I'm sorry, of efficiency to get the work done. And then I also heard that if there are several questions coming up that instant indicate a pattern, then that ought to be elevated for further discussion. What ought to Help us with the guardrails is when we have agreed upon goals. This is our work, this is our framework. Here's what we're supposed to be focusing on. Other things are peripheral, may be interesting. They have to go to the parking lot in some instances. But focusing on our goals helps define our work. What gets done, what has to be set aside. That makes sense.

start time: 5154:58:58.000
end time: 5164:38:10.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Can I underline that, Barbara? Because we had talked about the desire for a board work plan and I remember your words to me as like, well, those are the board goals coming from the strategic plan. And I guess I just wanted to pause and I wonder if that is the same thoughts that you all have as board members. Is that when you hear the word work plan, is it then operationalizing the Borgos and making those explicit connections to the strategic plan, or are you thinking and picturing something different?

start time: 5164:47:10.000
end time: 5176:38:38.000
confidence: 0.95
F: I'll say what I picture it would the work plan would have, you know, early in the summer setting the evaluation in concert with those superintendents, setting the evaluation template and then, you know, building in the quarterly check ins and then the end of the year, the valuation. It would have like the board evaluation on it. It would have the work plan for the budget. The boards work with the budget because we have to adopt it. You know, the budget. It would have like the other statutory requirements on it. It would have the work that the board needs to do in order to refer the bond. I mean, so those types of things.

start time: 5176:40:54.000
end time: 5177:45:18.000
confidence: 0.82
C: You'Re talking more like stranded calendar, like a scope and sequence.

start time: 5177:46:54.000
end time: 5189:34:10.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Well, with outcomes, like whatever. What is the outcome of something? So for example, for the board goals, my view is like our engagement with the board goals is really through the evaluation of the superintendent. So if we set the collaboratively set the board goals, if there's some sort of adjustments and like we're not going to be, I mean we only have, we have two educators on the board, but the rest of us aren't. So like, we're not going to be like, here's the curriculum you should use. Use to, you know, or professional development you should do to get the board goals. But ours would be in this pretence evaluation, you know, an agreement on progress towards the board goals and us measuring that or assessing it.

start time: 5189:56:30.000
end time: 5203:45:58.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I appreciate that. I think that goes back to the other point. Where is that if the board goals, all of the board goals are tied? Well, most of the board, three of the four are tied to the state assessment data that comes out in the spring. I think that other question that was asked earlier to you, Barbara, was, you know, Quarterly. Like I think even Gary had made that point too. Like what else are we kind of pulling in to assess our progress towards? I mean of course we have MAP or I Ready and some of these other interim assessments. But I don't know if it gets at the detail that's needed to say like, hey, we are on track to meeting state standard for third, fifth and eighth grade, which are essentially the verticals.

start time: 5203:48:54.000
end time: 5212:56:18.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And that's an important point. But interim assessments, I think you have to couch it to say according to our map data or according to our IREADY data, we seem to be on track to accomplish our goals. But I already can miss the mark sometimes give you this false sense of security and think, wait a minute, looks like they were ready here. And the end of the year state assessment didn't quite make it. But it's a reasonable assumption to say according to our I Ready or our map data, we are trending positively. We feel pretty good about progress. We're going to just keep forging ahead and not. And not get relaxed.

start time: 5212:59:14.000
end time: 5231:39:56.000
confidence: 0.95
F: I would just say also, Kimberly, that when the original that setting the eighth grade goal, the board had asked the superintendent to come back with a not just a how did they do on the state test but a more balanced assessment of for eighth grade. That wasn't again wasn't just those two scores. So that. And that never happened. And then the other thing is the high school one, in addition to graduation, there were college and career readiness indicators which like how many like CTE completers you had how many AP IV college credit classes were taken which couldn't. Could have measurements along that line. And at a certain point in time, like I say, the eighth grade never got fleshed out to be something other than just again to proficiency data points. And also I say then it was just the whole college and career readiness piece dropped off. So I think that's helpful.

start time: 5231:43:08.000
end time: 5234:12:44.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I didn't know about the eighth grade. One would love that opportunity to fine tune that one because that is probably the toughest.

start time: 5245:16:00.000
end time: 5246:36:56.000

confidence: 0.96
B: 245 would have been session now that's been canceled. To summarize it, we forge ahead. Let me ask the chair to chime in because we're going to cut across here about school board meetings and then about board committees. What is the current practice and any concerns about that. Let's hear from you.

start time: 5251:13:48.000
end time: 5252:06:44.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Yeah. Is there a question? Any concerns?

start time: 5252:07:32.000
end time: 5252:43:20.000

B: No, no concerns.

start time: 5252:57:00.000
end time: 5253:31:16.000
confidence: 0.98
A: So yeah, we have. We have three committees. We have.

start time: 5255:51:24.000
end time: 5257:05:08.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Well, we're very analytical. When I was in middle school, I used to analyze what caused humor.

start time: 5257:06:44.000
end time: 5257:40:52.000
confidence: 0.86
H: Anyways, how'd that work?

start time: 5257:41:16.000
end time: 5262:06:10.000
confidence: 0.90
A: After you, Joe. Yeah, comedic. Exactly. What was I talking about? Oh yeah, three committees. We have Policy Committee, we have the facilities Committee and we have Audit Committee.

start time: 5262:28:30.000
end time: 5262:51:30.000
confidence: 0.90
B: And how are they working?

start time: 5263:04:30.000
end time: 5263:49:42.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Policy committee is moving along great.

start time: 5263:52:46.000
end time: 5264:43:50.000
confidence: 0.87
B: But that's. You've got policies that are 20 years old.

start time: 5264:45:50.000
end time: 5270:19:22.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yes. So we. One of the one we asked from the policy committee was to be able to use our board work sessions also to have first and second readings to kind of expedite that process. And that has been implemented and. Yeah, but there's definitely a lot.

start time: 5270:22:26.000
end time: 5270:41:30.000
confidence: 0.75
B: Facilities committee.

start time: 5270:43:30.000
end time: 5277:11:54.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Facilities committee is moving to an ad hoc model as low as needed. So for example, when we have big, big building reviews or. Or bond or construction reviews though, that will happen. So they haven't met yet. And then Audit committee is the same thing. It's. It has, you know, there's deadlines for when the audit are due and. And where. When they're seasonal.

start time: 5277:14:02.000
end time: 5277:17:14.000
confidence: 0.99
E: So.

start time: 5277:17:22.000
end time: 5286:15:20.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah, so that's. That's periodical. I want to say quarterly, but I might be off a little bit quarterly or less. And then right now we were talking about forming a bond committee for. Specifically for the board work directly related to the May bond that's coming up and that. That is a very specific goal with a very specific deadline and a deliverable at a certain date. And that is currently trying to figure out who to. How to fill that one.

start time: 5286:17:20.000
end time: 5286:29:12.000
confidence: 0.71
E: Okay.

start time: 5286:31:36.000
end time: 5288:10:12.000
confidence: 0.98
B: And in general, committees have discussions, but they have to bring back discussions for decision to the entire. Yes.

start time: 5288:11:36.000
end time: 5289:17:48.000
confidence: 0.92
A: All decisions have to be made by the recommendations.

start time: 5289:20:44.000
end time: 5293:52:12.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Make recommendations. And I would assume also let's say you have a committee and board members are welcome to come to that committee even if they are not assigned to that particular committee because those are public meetings. You see the entire board coming to that committee meeting. What does that imply?

start time: 5293:54:36.000
end time: 5295:17:34.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Well, the only the committee members are allowed to decide the recommendations.

start time: 5295:19:32.000
end time: 5295:32:30.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Okay.

start time: 5295:39:30.000
end time: 5298:35:54.000
confidence: 0.94
A: The people who join, you know, ex officio there, they just listen. Yeah, they, they can provide input, but it is up to the committee members to decide how to use that input.

start time: 5298:36:42.000
end time: 5299:43:06.000
confidence: 0.97
C: And we do have quorum at policy committee, though, right? We have four of the seven.

start time: 5299:44:18.000
end time: 5302:13:10.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Yeah, but that's just somebody joining. And also by our policy, the chair is the ex officio member of every committee.

start time: 5303:59:50.000
end time: 5322:19:42.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Sorry, Jim, I was gonna say if we have some time to dig in on this, because I do think there are some challenges around this, and one of the ones that comes up for me is, is how the board weighs in kind of to what you were just saying, Barbara, Because I think it's problematic right now. I mean, we, we have a policy committee that makes recommendations to the board, but then when they come to the board, the first reading has traditionally been pretty pro forma. Like, oh, it comes to the board for first reading, but then second reading is when we adopt. And I think what I will just tell you, even after five years, I'm somewhat confused on, because we don't explicitly say at that first reading. Now would be a time for board members who were not on the policy committee to weigh in with amendments for changes to express opposition. That's just, it's usually very much a, hey, this is first reading. And any changes can, you know, we're going to get, we're going to get comment. But then there's also been sort of a tradition of like not really wanting to make changes just at the second reading because that would have triggered. So I'll just tell you, as someone who's never been on the policy committee, it's still confusing to me. What am I supposed to weigh in on a, on a controversial policy or even a non controversial policy? That's one issue. And then the second issue I, I think we should talk more about, should.

start time: 5322:20:06.000
end time: 5322:49:18.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Be at the first reading, by the way, but keep going.

start time: 5322:50:14.000
end time: 5336:01:58.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Okay. And then the second issue I'd like to talk more about is, is when we talk about policy, how deep are we going into operations or not? And you know, one of the things that Patty and Kimberly and I talked about in our little group breakout was like, I'll just put out, there's an example, one example of a cell phone policy is this. The board directs the superintendent to eliminate student access to cell phones during the school day period. And that's the policy. And that's a perfectly legitimate policy that then the superintendent would develop all the administrative directives around. How are we going to do that? The high school level, special schools Middle schools, like, all of that. It could look different, it could look consistent. But that's, you know, just as a current example, that's not the policy discussion we've been having. And we've had it in general board meetings, We've had it in policy committee. It's a much more detailed, like, do we use yonder pouches?

start time: 5336:02:14.000
end time: 5336:11:18.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Do we not?

start time: 5336:12:14.000
end time: 5338:44:10.000
confidence: 0.93
H: And so, as a board, we've never really taken time to talk about, like, what level should our policies be at, even at a. Even just philosophically.

start time: 5338:56:40.000
end time: 5341:41:36.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Got it. And that's critical for the entire board to agree to. So. Yeah, so add that to the parking lot, too.

start time: 5341:44:08.000
end time: 5379:56:42.000
confidence: 0.96
E: I think that's a really important conversation, and I think it's one, you know, that the board has to. I think it's an important conversation for the board to have, but also for the superintendent to be a part of, because, you know, what's the level of detail, of granularity that is needed from. I mean, again, going back to some of the research on boards and how they're effective. I think part of how they're effective is they set policies that make clear the direction and the values and the outcomes and the results that they want and are less likely to define the. The actual. How that gets operationalized. Oftentimes that can be administrative procedure or that can be other things. So, again, I think that's a decision that the board needs to make and can make, and it's a conversation that you all should have. But I think probably weighing in on having broad parameters in policy and giving the superintendent and the leadership the opportunity to really fill in the blanks of what that looks like and how that goes about defining the outcomes, defining the results that you all want to see, I think is. Is probably the best way to go. But again, that's a choice, and it's a conversation for you all to be able to have. Barbara I think we can. I'd love to spend a little more time on committees. It sounds like there might be others who want to weigh in. And then I think there's a couple of places where. Where I would love to just highlight from the policy document that you all have put together. But I will say, in general, I think it's excellent. I think you all have done a beautiful job, especially the framing on that first page, on page two of exhibit A, I think, is extraordinary. I think most school boards in the United States would love to have this kind of language, and it's really thoughtful, it's really intentional, and I think it's really explicit about what you're trying to accomplish and I think it's, it's great. So I've got a couple of places where I'm glad to highlight questions or maybe some areas that I've heard you talk about that we can dig into a little bit more in the next 10 minutes or so. But if there's other comments on committees, glad to entertain that it is our.

start time: 5379:57:06.000
end time: 5381:02:18.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Board committee or board meeting and then we've got to get to communication before we.

start time: 5381:03:14.000
end time: 5398:40:24.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah. And I think that's all helpful. I will say that the question that Andrew asked about policy, I would say for me as superintendent with this board is perhaps the biggest one. So I guess I'm just curious just to understand our follow up in the parking lot. Are we putting things on parking lot for perhaps our next quarterly meeting because. Or is that just something for. Just because I feel like being able to unpack like an example or something that we're like grappling with like in real time and be able to work towards solving it would for me be a tremendous support. But I also don't want to take away and I don't know how others are feeling but I feel like, you know, like let's grapple with the real thing and see if we can solve it and then maybe that will help future discussions and where else we might find time to be able to have these conversations.

start time: 5398:41:12.000
end time: 5406:15:00.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So I'm glad you brought that up. So two things in the parking lot means we can't solve it here nor can we make a decision here because this is not the time that you're supposed to have to come to conclusions and make decisions. But that doesn't mean it couldn't be in the next work session or in the next board meeting or that staff bring some recommendations on some revisions. It doesn't wait until the next board retreat. Absolutely not. But you can't solve it here or we'd be here until 5:00.

start time: 5406:22:00.000
end time: 5406:38:24.000
confidence: 0.91
I: Won't be.

start time: 5406:41:12.000
end time: 5407:05:52.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Or longer or at least some of.

start time: 5407:06:16.000
end time: 5407:34:24.000
confidence: 0.88
G: Us won't be came earlier.

start time: 5407:35:52.000
end time: 5407:59:00.000
confidence: 0.77
B: So. So you can't.

start time: 5408:55:20.000
end time: 5409:23:28.000
confidence: 0.98
D: You're welcome to stay till 5.

start time: 5409:25:44.000
end time: 5415:13:46.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So part doesn't imply that it's not crucial. Just implies we can't fix it here and now. But it can very easily be on your next work session some time to think through it, some time for policy committee to even bring suggestions. Those are critical items that just can't be settled here and now. Great point.

start time: 5415:16:18.000
end time: 5415:34:02.000
confidence: 0.95
G: I just have a question.

start time: 5415:35:46.000
end time: 5415:40:26.000
confidence: 0.49
B: Yes.

start time: 5415:40:58.000
end time: 5429:29:36.000
confidence: 0.94
G: Talk about question number two says how are board committees helpful in achieving the goals of the board what did that look like? When we talk about board goals, how should committees do that? Are we just doing that at board meetings only or is that something that. When we talk about a lot of the metrics that we're looking for in order to achieve our student achievement, because this is all what we're here for, student achievement. Everything else is second. Can that be done in committee? Some of that can be done in committee. Or do we want to just look at that work section or board meetings.

start time: 5429:31:28.000
end time: 5435:23:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: All the time in committee? No decisions are made in committee meetings. Review and other board members come and listen in and participate. But all of that, I want you to remember coherent. Everything you do ought to be focused and within those guardrails of your plan and your goals.

start time: 5435:32:10.000
end time: 5439:12:30.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Yes, I guess I would definitely like to see either committees or board meetings really focus on student achievement. You know, when I look at. At least. You know, I just want to make sure that that's what we're focusing on.

start time: 5439:29:30.000
end time: 5445:43:28.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And here's a rule of thumb. If you have a committee meeting and the entire board is coming because they all want to hear it at the same time, then it's not a committee. It ought to just be. It can be monthly or quarterly updates on student achievement and some of your strategic plan outcomes and trends with your data. That's. Student achievement is probably too large for committee because the entire board wants to hear that. I'm glad you clarify.

start time: 5445:45:04.000
end time: 5449:04:20.000
confidence: 0.98
E: I would agree with that. I think student achievement needs to be. Is the work of the board and needs to be in the full board conversation. And creating structures for having that conversation I think will be important going forward.

start time: 5449:20:00.000
end time: 5454:18:00.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Everyone else pretty comfortable that the way. Shouldn't say comfortable. Everyone pretty clear on the way board meetings are structured and the way committee meetings are structured. Do we need another committee? Should we cut away some committees, in your opinion? Sounds like you've got two that are ad hoc and one that is continual.

start time: 5454:20:40.000
end time: 5455:26:48.000
confidence: 0.80
F: Since you asked, you said that everybody's final. By the way, the board meetings are set.

start time: 5455:29:04.000
end time: 5456:07:36.000
confidence: 0.86
B: Board meetings and committee meetings.

start time: 5456:08:08.000
end time: 5456:24:56.000
confidence: 0.98
F: I will just say I'm not.

start time: 5456:26:08.000
end time: 5456:58:16.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Tell us. Tell us now the time.

start time: 5456:59:28.000
end time: 5461:08:08.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Well, it's the. Going back to. I feel like it's not about the work of the board because I. It's the board meeting and often we're just sitting there. I can. I can sit for two hours and not do anything.

start time: 5461:09:44.000
end time: 5461:22:20.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Okay.

start time: 5461:36:00.000
end time: 5465:23:32.000
confidence: 0.94
F: And it's useful to listen, but frankly it's not. I think if that's the place we're going to do our work, we should be doing it public, like our board Meeting should be structured more to be doing our board work.

start time: 5465:25:16.000
end time: 5465:42:44.000
confidence: 0.98
B: More discussion.

start time: 5465:44:52.000
end time: 5475:54:50.000
confidence: 0.93
F: More discussion, more engagement with each other around the things that we've said are important versus that just happen to get on the agenda. And it's there. Our agendas generally achievement focus or it's unclear what they're focused on because we don't, we haven't said like these are the five things we want to get accomplished as a board this year. And this, this is why we're. We're hearing this presentation or this is why we're soliciting board members viewpoints, perspectives, you know, as we put this something else together.

start time: 5476:02:30.000
end time: 5483:45:12.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So then a possibility. Tell me if this sort of goes along with what you would be more hopeful for. So if one board meeting a month actually had a portion of the strategic plan, student outcomes, for example, we're focusing on math this month and a report out of what's going on. And some discussions, some further questions among the board members focused on the strategic plan, student outcome, student learning. That would be more along the lines of what you would hope for. Yes.

start time: 5483:46:16.000
end time: 5490:28:20.000
confidence: 0.97
F: And the other things that we need to, to do as a board and if like, you know, say everybody wants to weigh in on an issue that we need to work on with, like let's get that on the board agenda. But we might not know it because like we're not an agenda setting meeting. And then we just get the agenda and it's like, oh, I guess that's what we're talking about this meeting.

start time: 5490:38:40.000
end time: 5496:01:44.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And some of that could be handled in offline meetings or one on one meeting with the superintendent as well because she's able to assess. I've had four different board members bring this topic up. Chair. So I think it's something we need to be having a report out at the next board meeting because it seemed to be pretty critical that can be maneuvered there.

start time: 5496:03:12.000
end time: 5506:49:32.000
confidence: 0.92
F: So that's one way. I also find because we bring such different experiences and expertise and interests and we're connected into different parts of the community is like, I love hearing from other board members. This is why I think there's a value of setting something. What is the frame? Because something may not even be on my radar screen, but it's like, oh my God, it's totally missing for Patty and Eddie. You know, like we gotta be paying attention to this because this is what the board is doing and here's the impact it's having on classrooms. So. And not that we can't bring up issues the superintendent, but I also think we missed some of the Value so the collective wisdom, perspectives and experience.

start time: 5506:51:16.000
end time: 5510:24:00.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So there are some boards who, after they've concluded their business, say other items, issues for discussion by board members. Something as simple as that brings up an opportunity for open discussion.

start time: 5511:08:20.000
end time: 5512:53:10.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Yes. Although that's usually at 10 o'clock at night or 9, if we've adhered to the agenda and people want to go.

start time: 5512:54:20.000
end time: 5513:48:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Oh my God, you meet regularly until 10:00 at night.

start time: 5515:05:30.000
end time: 5515:26:42.000
confidence: 0.89
C: That's what I wanted to address.

start time: 5515:28:26.000
end time: 5516:05:54.000
confidence: 0.88
G: Like, even with all the dialogue.

start time: 5516:06:42.000
end time: 5516:10:26.000
confidence: 0.47
B: Yeah.

start time: 5516:10:58.000
end time: 5523:48:36.000
confidence: 0.93
G: That means our board meetings need to be structured in a way that we get that done in a timely fashion. You know, and so if that means, if we, as an example, that we need to reduce the proclamations down to 2 minutes versus 30 minutes or whatever, so you can have that time for a dialogue because, you know, after a certain time and everybody's coming for work and all that stuff going, you know, to 12, 1:00 in the morning is just.

start time: 5523:51:08.000
end time: 5524:02:44.000

G: And so you might have one a year maybe, but, you know, doing. Being able to have that dialogue and do it in a timely fashion is going to be important. So that may mean the board really needs to be structured to talk about maybe one or two items and to go into however much detail or dialogue you need to go into. That's. That's definitely important. And I learned that last year.

E: And I think that's. That's about systems and habits. Right. That's about the structure. That's about how do you, how do you structure your work and how do you have the discipline of making sure. Sure that there's a regular focus on teaching and learning, there's a regular focus on instructional issues while still taking care of the things that you have to take care of the statutory requirements, the contracts, the things that you have to do. But being able to organize and focus your time and your agenda on the things that are most important and the instructional areas, I think that's really important. I hear from you that a lot of the protocols that are in place are pretty good. And that is probably not worth having a ton of extra conversation around additions or refinements, except maybe in the area of committees. And this important conversation that we're having right now around how to structure board meetings and how to make sure that we are focused on teaching and learning. But I think there are a couple of places, Barbara, if I may, that we've got a bunch of slides here, but I think there's a couple places that might Be useful in the short term to develop systems and habits around that. Could just clarify a few things and then allow more of that focus time. Rather than spending more time on how the board protocols work and things like that and trying to come to consensus on it. Maybe there's a couple of quick hits that can be undertaken and then focus more of that time on what is the work that the board is to do. How do we focus on teaching and learning, have that more of that Good conversation. I would say a couple of areas. One, I heard, heard that there are practices around information flow for school board meetings. And I want to see if that's working well. And maybe it doesn't have to be adjusted, maybe it doesn't have to be incorporated into policy or into the protocol, but if that's working well, just maybe just having that somewhere. This is our practice around information flow. It's 12 days before, it's eight days before it's. Et cetera. That's one, two is clarify the path of communication for information requests and substantive questions. Eddie talked about this a little bit before. This doesn't necessarily have to be a vote or a protocol, but this could be a conversation with the board chair and the board vice chair and the superintendent around. What does that look like in terms of. Can those, you know, can we request that board members send substantive questions or information requests to the board chair, the. The senior board manager and the superintendent? And so there's a way to manage all of that. I think that's a, That's a, That's a good conversation to be having. And then I. One thing I would say in your protocol that I. I would want you to at least think about maybe slightly changing the practice, which is it says board members will share information they receive from information requests with a other board members. I might just suggest having that be a responsibility of the. Of this, the leadership of the superintendent and the leadership, rather than a responsibility of individual board members to have to share the information that they receive with other board members. So. And then the last thing I would say is, and Kimberly made reference to this earlier, making sure that there's conversation about how does the superintendent communicate on a regular basis, things that are happening that you need to know about. If there is, God forbid, a safety issue or if there is a labor issue that's going on, how is that information communicated? How do people. How do individual board members want that information to be communicated? Is it a text? Is it an email, Is it a phone call? Are there different types of communication that you want for different types of. Of information. And I think again, that doesn't necessarily have to be in policy, that doesn't necessarily have to be even in. In your protocols. But to have the conversation about the. The preferences of each of the board members and how they like to receive information when it's exigent, I think would be helpful as well. And if we, if y'all think about those pieces, I think we can skip to the next, like seven or eight slides here and. And in the interest of time, move on.

F: Around to. Gary, your point about proclamations? I keep thinking about the idea of how much time the board spends, and this is one that we've wrestled with over the years where proclamations can take a long time and they feel. They can feel very performative if they're brief. And so what. And what happens is then we want to invite people to speak about them. And if you invite somebody, they can't be there for less than 20 minutes of a conversation with the board. And looking ahead, I'm thinking we have some months. We have three proclamations in the board meeting, which could be 40 minutes if we start inviting people to either talk about something. So this is something I'd love to have.

start time: 5628:54:10.000
end time: 5635:22:02.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So there are ways to consolidate. There are ways to consolidate. And some boards, some boards have a quarterly recognition, so that's something they do on a quarterly basis. And you know it's going to be a bunch of recognitions and proclamations. You don't have to take up large portions of every meeting around that. We can talk more about that as well. Communication, Jim, we gotta move.

start time: 5635:25:06.000
end time: 5681:27:30.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Yeah, I think we, I think I raised the questions of communication with, on this slide with the superintendent. Maybe we, you know, those are topics for conversation and really, I mean, it's a big part of that with, you know, a wonderful new superintendent who, if you, who you all have hired, is about building that relationship. So I would just, you know, you can take a look at these sort of suggestions and thoughts. I think the one thing I would highlight here is with new superintendents in particular, our experience has been that it's very useful regardless of what your protocol is around being able to ask senior staff for, you know, being able to ask senior staff questions or for information. With a new superintendent, our experience has been it's very useful and very valuable for in the short term all of those substantive questions and all of those information requests to be flowed through, at least with a CC to the superintendent, oftentimes directly to the superintendent so that she can get a real handle on what are the questions that you have? What are the issues that you're hearing from your constituents? It's really part of the, in a way, the onboarding process, it's part of the relationship building process. It's really part of how the superintendent really gets to understand the district and the issues and priorities that individual board members and the board as a whole has. So that third bullet point I think is, is fairly important if you're open to it in the short term. And if, and I don't know if, and if Kimberly wants that, that, that, that really that information flow to and through her in the short term while she is making her entry into the district. And again, I think if you, you don't want to spend a whole lot of time on your other protocols, we've, you know, I think you've got some pretty good protocols around constituent relations. I think I heard some version of the first bullet point earlier today, which is sort of the practice which is if there are constituent questions or concerns, those should be referred back into the district at the appropriate level first. And, but if, I think this is the second bullet is part of what we talked about earlier, which is the two way street and the joint responsibility that if, if the, just. If the issue remains unresolved or, or it really represents larger systemic concerns, that those really should be brought to, to the attention of the superintendent and appropriate staff. So I think we've covered all that and so I, I feel Good. But we haven't dug into media much. But it doesn't, you know, I'm not sure that hasn't surfaced today. So I'm not sure how big an, if an issue is. We can talk about it. Barbara. But in, in the interest of time, maybe we're doing okay on that one.

B: So at a very high level, I just want to say something briefly around these, we want to say something, these three areas, talk about strategic planning. I want Kim to just briefly go over the visual that's in your packet on the strategic level because there's going to be lots more discussion that needs to take focus around that. And then Eddie will say something briefly about superintendency evaluation. And then we've got some, some possible resources for you for board member evaluation. And then we'll be at strategic planning. Madam Superintendent.

end time: 5716:11:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah, I think it can be a 60 second or less conversation. So the team has been working, the executive team has been working on what it means to be a high performing team, getting clear on our theory of action. And all of that will result in a work plan that we're hoping to have established within the next month and a half which details how we're operationalizing the strategic plan. And so that work is still anchor and anchor and foundational. We know that it has the 2025 as an end date, though that's not how we're approaching the work. I do anticipate that there'll be some refinements and some matrix to show the action within it. But as time goes on, but that we are busy anchoring and aligning our work to the strategic plan. And so my reports and whether it's the superintendent report or other updates to the board will be sharing out the results and progress on our work plan through the lens of the strategic work.

start time: 5716:44:50.000
end time: 5729:57:08.000
confidence: 0.94
F: And how are we going to resolve the issue of alignment with the verticals and, and, and I guess having the broader conversation about like everybody having ownership because I, I do feel like when it, it kicked off there was like broad community. I mean we had these huge meetings with these, all these, you know, post it notes and that got a submission of vision values and then it just like disappeared to the community. I don't think you could tell. Most community members could say anything. They know what the graduate portrait is maybe, but the plan is just gone kind of completely underground. And I feel like, also somewhat for the board as well. So I'm interested in how then, like, we reconnect up or resolve how we're.

start time: 5729:57:24.000
end time: 5734:48:18.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Going to reconnect up. I've made that a note for things that we need discuss tomorrow when we have some time. Got some ideas for that as well. You can bring back some potential around trying to merge below the value level, at the goals level, see what kind of merger might take place and some proposals you might bring forward.

start time: 5734:50:34.000
end time: 5757:33:00.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Right. And I think just my connection. I appreciate the question. I think my quick reaction to that is just really wanting to get clear on what that the bottom line up front, as I'll say, as Dan often says, the bottom line up front for the board goals. Because I know that, you know, our goal and interest is that 100% of our students are meeting standard in, you know, all of the grades three through eight. I know that our board goals are specific on black and native students, and it shows the percentage of growth over time our work is aligned to getting our students to standard anyway. And so. So I would love to hear at some point, direction from the board on specific work. I will say, as chief academic officer, we were heavily tied to and leaning in on a strategic plan. And I think, I mean, I'll be honest, the. The conversations around Borgos tended to be between, you know, Guadalupe and you. All it is. And something that really made its way in our office because our goal is right. We want all students to be able to meet standard on all of the assessments. But. So I don't. I don't know if I have a lot of experience other than just the last two months of hearing about it, to speak fluently to.

A: Yeah. So leadership and us have met with. Have met a couple times to talk about it. I think what we decided on was to start with the school board partners template. Yeah, Template. And start with that. And then we also brought in the chief of HR and also the chief of assessment and accountability, Dr. Adams. Right. And what they're currently working based off that template, working on a draft to kind of bring in more data points that are, you know, feedback that is not only gives you good data, but also useful in terms of improving performance. And that was our. One of our focus goals is like, how can this data be used to improve our performance? And so they're. They're coming back to us hopefully soon with a draft that leadership and board leadership will Will review and our. The date we're aiming for is to have a draft to present to the board on September 24 for more input, solicit more input and then additions or, you know, if we want to edit it more.

end time: 5791:45:38.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I think that's a good question. But I think the idea is that it's always easier to work off the initial draft whether you're going to go with it or not. You know, just like have a basis of ideas like this is a general format first. And then if we want to, if the board decides to deviate completely from that, that's fine. But I think that the idea of that is that this would be a starting point for discussion.

start time: 5791:48:34.000
end time: 5793:57:22.000
confidence: 0.98

F: We'll share the draft of what you're thinking because we spent a lot of time on this other draft. I mean, with AJ for, you know, the whole. We're going to be focused on student achievement. We built this whole thing on that. And again, I don't know what the school board partners is. And maybe it's fine. Maybe it's got a same focus on student achievements, but it's different. But I think before you get too far down the path, it's already almost September of sharing that with everyone else. So just get at least a high level. Like what concerns do you have thumbs up items or what questions might you have if we go down that path? Just so, you know, show up with a, like, hey, you know, we're not, we're not. You don't have a majority borderline.

H: Can I just add on. I'm less concerned about the actual format. Although I will point out if we switch, it'll be the fourth template in five years I think that we've used. But it's fine. I'm more concerned about the philosophical question about what's in there and I don't know, school board partners. But, you know, I just want to point out AJ Was very clear. The board evaluation should only be on the board. Sorry, superintendent evaluation should only be on the board. That's it. We, as A board pushed back on that and said, okay, we're going to use board goals and we're going to add these management.

H: A little bit more just these four goals. But philosophically, to Julia's point, that's where I think the board needs to weigh in. Are we just going to focus on board goals? Are we going to focus on board goals plus something else? Are we not using board goals anymore that would concern me else right now, like, if that's not superintendent valuations, I'll just throw that up there. Food for them.

F: Thank you. The other thing I want to weigh in on and we kind of got caught on this last election cycle was making sure that at least say we still have data that's trailing that goes into August that we know for sure three board members may or may not be here next. So there's not to complete at least some of our work if we have non student achievement data as part of it, that the board that's evaluating the superintendent. Because what we got involved in last time is like, well, maybe we should have the board, the board members who previously were on the board weigh in because they were here for the board versus Patty Nettie who weren't here. So I just. I think this also knowing this is a switch over year versus a year in which there's no board elections that anything that's tied to that later data that we try and have at least a portion of that done.

C: I think that's really helpful because I was in conversations with Dr. Adams, who was working on a template, and his recommendation was to not use the selected board goals and to look at the dispositions that you all had what selecting the superintendent in the initial first year. And so I think if there are some thoughts, feedback or concerns that that's sent to Dr. Adams, who's working on that.

confidence: 0.96
B: And I don't want to weigh in too much because you guys have had folks given instruction and drafting and what have you. Certainly first year may not be what your consecutive years become for a superintendent's evaluation. First year is usually largely tied to the entry plan, the 100 day plan, the strategic plan, what have you. I will let the chair and others weigh in on that. Happy to consult as you're working through that process as well. Jim, if you'll say something about school board self evaluation, we're down to pluses and deltas and wrap up.

E: Yep. No, real quick, y'all have identified this as a. As a priority that you. You want, you know, and, and to do a board self evaluation that you want to assess your work and your progress and do some self reflection and to. To really make that a part of your regular protocols. And so there are several instruments out there that could be used or alternatively a. A custom designed protocol could be developed for the school board specifically here Portland. But the council of Great City Schools has an instrument. School board partners, the group that you just talked about, has a self evaluation instrument as does. I haven't seen it, but it's referenced in the Oregon School Boards association handbook that they also have a tool that could be used for board self evaluation. I think I'm pretty agnostic as to which individual tool you use. More so than that, the act of self reflection and self assessment is really important and powerful for a school board to undertake on a regular basis.

I'm willing to work with the superintendent on some possibilities there as well. The cadence of your meetings. Chair board willing to certainly give you some support on that as well. AJ's document. I'm gonna leave that to the board for some future discussion. What does policy mean and what level of detail do you want in the policy? That's something that needs to be for a full board discussion as well. And then Patty's going to look at school board evaluations. Did I miss anything on the parking? Self evaluation. Sorry?

Certainly can't solve critical issues that are facing school boards. But your engagement here, your discussion, your transparency has Certainly been helpful. I want to thank you for that. I certainly look forward to continuing the discussion and getting onto some of those matters that we couldn't delve into today. And with that, I will leave to my partner, Jim, to close us out.

Things and I think identify some of the work that needs to happen going forward. I want to congratulate you on hiring a fabulous superintendent. I think, you know, Kimberly is going to do amazing work. You all had a very careful, thoughtful process, and I think you've identified a wonderful leader for the future and someone who you as a board will be able to work with and do great work with. And I look forward to wonderful things happening for the children of Portland. I want to say how much I appreciate Barbara and I do this work a lot with a lot of different boards. And I don't think I've ever been with a board that had so much laughter in a board meeting, in a retreat. And I just want to say how much I appreciate that. It means you're open to connecting with each other and working with each other. And it also means you. You're reflecting the tremendous joy that is in this work of educating children. And so I just really appreciate and admire that. And the last thing I'll say that I really admire about all of you and this board is first of all, your willingness to serve either as superintendent or as a board member. These are hard jobs. It's hard work, but it's critically important to the lives and the futures of kids. And I can see and feel and hear your deep commitment to high quality education for children. So really appreciate you. Really appreciate the work of today and the work of that will be ongoing in the future. And thanks for the opportunity to be with you today.
