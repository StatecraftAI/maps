A: All right, Good afternoon. We're going to go ahead and get started with the policy committee meeting today. We have one additional member coming and I don't think JJ is. Our student rep is going to come today, but we are going to have. Or is he going to be online? He's online. Ok, awesome. Welcome, jj. So we're going to start today's meeting. Just the general rundown for today is that we're going to take public comment first and then we will have a presentation by Dr. Adams of some of the survey work of students that has happened over the last month and a half. And focus groups. We're going to hear from two students with the district student council, student representative perspective. And then we have a revised draft policy that has been. That's been built out based on our last discussion that we had around core elements with a trying to find that sort of where the center of the board seemed to land on the core elements. And we'll see how well we did. So with that, I'm going to ask Ms. Bradshaw to call the people who've signed up for public comment. Yes, we have Peter Green.

D: Madam Chair, members of the school board committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important issue. I'm their director of Post58, a local nonprofit organization which for the last 31 years has provided outdoor and leadership opportunities for thousands of students from high schools in the Portland public school area and surrounding areas. The Post has prohibited the use of cell phones during its activities for several years now because we are trying to create a space where students can learn and grow and feel good about themselves. On social media, it seems often students learn to feel bad about themselves. We want them to connect with new friends and not just exist in their narrow circle of friends that they brought with them from middle school. The pattern in the vans when we head off to our activities is pretty typical. As we drive somewhere for the first half hour or so, they go to sleep, and after a while they wake up and pretend they're asleep for another half hour or so. Eventually, one of them gets the courage to ask a question of the driver because it's much safer to ask the adult a question than their peers. They don't know. And then usually one student will comment on the answer back from the adult and that'll begin the Conversation, much safer way to go. But once that happens, you can just listen to the conversation begin to flow and talk, and they begin to spend a little bit of time knowing each other. And then if it's going well, after an hour or so, they'll be playing games and ideally by the end, they're giggling with each other and maybe have made a friend, maybe not. But they've created a social learning situation that, regardless of how it ends up, was a learning experience for the kids even before we get to the outdoors, which is the focus of our organization. And we're very intentional how we structure these rides for the students because we see this development happening just by having them have to be with each other without any distractions. We've seen some great results, the most encouraging of which is that once the kids understand that phones are not a part of their experience, they seem to wholly let go of them. In fact, after the trip, I've often needed to remind students to pick up their phones from me before they leave. And, you know, when I hand them back their phones, it almost never makes them smile. Okay, all right. From the school perspective, it isn't only that phones are a distractive toy in the learning environment. It's the time between classes and during lunch where the sense of social and emotional growth occurs and the schools have the ability to create the most positive space possible. In a brief survey we did with our students, there was one simple but meaningful comment that stood out to me. Without phones, I learn more about the people around me. Thank you.

E: Hi everyone. My name is Virginia laforte. I'm a Grant High School parent. I have been for four years and I've got four more to go. And I wanted to come here today to thank you for taking up the issue of the cell phone policy in our schools. Grandparents, parents have been discussing a lot of what has been negative press and how it really doesn't align at all with the sentiment that we're feeling around the school and from our students and our kids. We posted a quick survey last night to see if what we were feeling was actually accurate. We have a Grant High School parents and caregivers Facebook group. Some of you may be familiar with it. It's a very active and we received 110 responses. I think I put it up at like, I don't know, seven or eight o'clock last night and I wanted to share some of the comments that we received. And over 80% believed that the Policy has had a positive impact on their students. So let me just read a couple to you. I've got the most, the most impactful, positive thing that that has happened in my child's education. Absolutely love the policy of no phones for the school day. Giving the kids seven straight hours of uninterrupted cell phone free time is so helpful for both social and educational aspects of high school. I'm really glad that they aren't given access to their phones at lunch or during passing periods. This has been great for my child, a freshman. It has been a lifesaver and hugely impactful. My daughter is experiencing much less anxiety and better focus. Also better relationships. My student tells me she is less distracted during class and feels more connected to her friends because they're talking at lunch instead of looking at their phones. We started out thinking we would hate it. Too draconian, too authoritarian. We can't argue with the effectiveness of this policy. It's an absolute game changer for my kid. The benefit to mental health cannot be overstated. Teachers can focus on education and kids can focus on class. Talking to each other at lunch. And I see them all chatting and making eye contact as they leave each day. It is wonderful. 100%. Can I finish? I don't have a lot left. 100% support Mr. McGee's leadership on this. I have heard from my student and her teachers that the learning environment has dramatically improved this year. None of these comments were mine. And I'm here today to just say that they're not just phones. Kind of what our previous public comment was saying. They're social media machines, they're intrusive. Kids do not need 2200 cameras in their schools. They're disruptive, they're anxiety inducing. And I feel like if we value the mental health of our students, we really need to expand this policy across multiple schools and keep it as is. What Mr. McGhee is doing is working and we'd love. I know that there's a student survey you're going to be talking about today. I can't wait to hear about it. But I don't believe that grandparents have actually been surveyed after the policy has been implemented. There's been a shift in some of the louder voices that we were hearing last spring to now. And I think it's a really valuable input for your decision making process. And one thing, one last thing. I don't have it listed here, but the lunch thing and the passing period thing, that's. I shared this with you. It's in your email. It Comes up repeatedly that that is truly one of the most valuable things that has come out of this whole process is keeping the phones out. So an exception for lunch or an exception for passing it doesn't seem to be what anyone's asking for. So I'm just not so sure that it's really the compromise that we're looking for.

A: That's it. Thank you so much. And if you have materials you want to submit for the record or to get distributed to the rest of the board, please give them to Ms. Bradshaw or Ms. Powell. Mildred Castillo Borjes Born hi, my name is Lovely Castillo and I go to Beaumont Middle School. And my feelings on it are a little iffy about it because sure, sometimes it does help the students be focused in class. But also, about a month ago, there was an incident at my school where we had a lock in and we weren't allowed to leave the classroom we were in. And we couldn't contact any of our parents about what was going on. So our parents were confused, concerned. And I feel like just locking the phones on the yonder pouches is not the best idea for safety. Although sometimes it does help, like with how the parent was saying that they are more. They talk a lot more. It also just feels a lot restricting to us. And if I'm honest, most of my classmates at school do not use it. We mainly just leave it in our lockers or just hide it under some bugs or something and felt like it was a lot of money that could be used in other places, such as AC for my school because it gets really, really hot during the summer. So I feel like that money could be used elsewhere and we could have other compromises instead of just locking it straight up, like putting it into our lockers or if they see us on it, they just immediately take it. No, no, no compromises that. Oh, I was just using it for this or that. And sometimes also music helps us stay focused in class. Sometimes when I am working, my friends sometimes distract me or if I have my AirPods in or something, I get a lot more work done because I am locked into what I am doing and not talking to my friends about it. So that could also be another benefit from having our phones on us, which I feel like is good for working during class. Thank you so much for coming today and sharing your perspective. Thank you. That concludes, you signed up for public comment today. Great. Thanks everybody for coming today and giving us a look into how things are in the schools that have cell phone restrictions, how they're playing out for Students. And next we. As I mentioned earlier, one of the things that we had contemplated when we started putting together the policy. This goes back to last school year. The student rep, Frankie Silverstein, had ask if we could survey students as part of this. And we agreed to do that. So as part of the handout between Frankie and JJ, our new student rep, working with Dr. Adams, there was a survey created. And now we're going to welcome Dr. Adams to share your findings. Do you want us to wait till the end or.

F: Board has been consistent in the desire to implement a potential ban. And so our survey did not ask questions such as, do you like a ban or not like a ban? Instead, the survey was designed to elicit information that might inform the board's policy drafting. This is obviously a very popular topic at the moment. There have been a number of articles and other things written about the possibility of a cell phone ban in pps. And so what we did is we had some research questions. Are they being implemented with fidelity? What are students perceptions of how the bands are working? And the way we went about this was twofold. We did a survey for all high school students, grades nine through 12. And we also visited the school site, two high school sites that were implementing the yonder pouches. And we did some interviews with some students. We also talked to leaders. But the survey was really about student voice. So that's what we're trying to elevate. So let's get right to the results. First, a little demographic breakdown. You'll note by the pie chart in the upper right hand corner that each grade level was just about equally represented, grades nine through 12. And then we had a little over 2,100 students respond to the survey. You can see the breakdown by race and ethnicity shown by the bar charts. We also asked about students gender and sexual identity. Just over half of the participants who responded identified as girls or women. 35% identified as boys or men. 9% of students who responded said yes to the question I am transgender. So regarding current personal electronic device use in school, we asked the question, what do you mainly use your personal electronic device for in school? This is an item that allows students to select multiple choices. And so we don't show percentages Here we show counts. As you can see the top two responses. Number one was texting, number two was slightly behind that with classwork or instruction, and then the third highest current use was taking photos or videos. We were interested in whether schools or teachers had current policies, so we asked the following two does your school currently have a personal electronic device policy that requires devices to be off and away during the school day? And separately, do any of your teachers have a PED policy that requires devices to be off and away during the school day? And you can see those percentages shown by the light gray and the navy blue. Overall, 87% of students reported that their school has a current policy and 77% of our respondents reported that their classroom teachers had policies. Next, we asked about a personal electronic device used for instruction or in school clubs and activities. We asked the following question. This chart shows the percentage of students who responded yes, do any of your teachers allow you to use your personal electronic device for instructional purposes? And do you participate in any school clubs or activities that require or allow the use of a personal electronic device? Across all of our sites and programs, 42% of students reported that personal electronic devices are allowed for instructional purposes, and 47% reported that they were allowed in school clubs or activities. Next, we wanted to learn about current personal electronic device implementation versus how students might prefer it be implemented if they had one at their school. This was also an item that allows students to select more than one option. So again we're showing numbers of responses here and not percentages. Here you can see the difference between current implementation and what students would prefer. We asked if your school or any of your teachers had a personal electronic device policy that requires them to be off and away during class, how is it implemented? And if your school were to implement an often away policy, what method or methods would you prefer? We had just we had 899 students respond to this item and you can see that in terms of student preference, the top two choices are students are expected to keep their devices off and away and students keep their personal electronic devices face down on their desks while the top two current implementation practices are often away followed by yonder pouches. We then wondered what students thought about when personal electronic devices should be allowed for use. So the question was given an often away personal electronic device policy. When should students be allowed to use their personal electronic devices? This again is an item that allowed students to select more than one option. Here, more students reported that they should be allowed to use their personal electronic device during lunch than other categories this finding was also echoed with the students that we met with in the focus groups, which we will discuss in just a few minutes. We also asked about stress level. We asked both sides of this coin, would students feel an increase of stress if they were separated from their device? And we also asked if they would feel a decrease in stress. And you can see from the results 54% of respondents said that they would feel increased stress if they were separated from the device and when asked if they would feel decreased stress, 76% said no. We also had an open ended item on the survey. We had 761 students from 11 schools and programs provided responses to the following question what additional questions, comments or concerns do you have regarding the draft personal electronic device policy? On the next two slides I'll talk about those findings. Overall, students actually support personal electronic device policies. The majority of students who responded want PED free classrooms. They do advocate for appropriately serious and consistently enforced consequences and students also strongly desire access during non instructional time, especially during lunch. Students also see the need for flexible policies. They shared that PDS do have some academic value, especially in certain classes. Examples that were provided to us by students included robotics, art and newspaper. And then the concept of independent working and being able to listen to music with your headphones on was also something that came across with the student open ended responses. We also found in the open ended responses the idea that all day separation from the device was a cause for concern. What students express is that the cell phones provide a sense of safety and so they worry about access to emergency services. They worry about communicating with their families. And then as we know, we have a lot of students that leave campus during lunch and they report that they feel less safe without their device with them when they leave campus. In terms of personal electronic devices and access needs, students shared that basically that their non English speaking families and friends are reluctant to call the front office and that they use their devices sometimes for just in time translation activities. And students who use their phones as medical devices or to contact outside resources for their physical and mental health worry about access. I did have the opportunity to speak to a parent who shared that her student has social anxiety and often has a counselor or therapist on speed dial and that not having the device has been a bit of a challenge for them. So that's just one example. I know there could be many, many more. Let's talk about the focus groups. We did not. I'll just start by saying we did not speak to as many students as we wanted to, which I could get into later. But we're happy that we were able to speak to the students who were available at the time that the staff visited the schools. So we went to the high schools with Yonder Pouches. So we went to Grant and Cleveland. We talked to a total of 18 students representing grades nine through 12. The themes that came out of those conversations, first categorized on the left, are positive perceptions of the policy. Students share things like better focus, time during class, more time spent in class, less time in the hallway, and the idea that consistent implementation makes the expectation clear. Concerns and suggestions they talked about long lines, entering and leaving specific to the Yonder Pouches in the two schools. Again, the concept of safety when leaving campus during lunch, finding friends, making purchases for lunch without the access to their digital wallet, anxiety about emergency situations, and some students saying that they felt like Yonder was costly and inflexible. A quote that we pulled out from a student said, last year I used to walk home with my best friend every day. But this year we have only walked together a few times because it's too hard to make a plan to find one another at the end of the school day without a device. So the research and evaluation team make the following recommendation that the conclusion rather based on the information we glean from students first, that personal electronic policies are beneficial and that they should have appropriate and consistently enforced consequences. And students, based on the information we gathered, also want more flexible policies. Examples that other schools may be implementing include off and away policies, phone caddies, etc. Etc. And also they want access to them for educational purposes like newspaper, robotics and art. This flexible policies would also allow students to use their devices, to use electronic payments at lunch, communicate with family and friends, and feel safer when they are off campus. And with that, that concludes our results. I will take any questions you may have.

A: Great. Thank you very much. And I also want to note that I believe both the PowerPoint you just presented and a separate sort of more narrative study along with all of the comments which you know, sometimes it's hard to get people to comment in the open comment section. And students like definitely provided comments which I thought were very interesting. Some polite, some less so. But I think to me very useful just to get some insights from a broad variety of students. So thank you for presenting that as well. And that's posted. We'll go to questions and I think I'm going to start with just jj. Do you. Would you like to start if you have any questions?

We thank you for the question, jj. I appreciate this means student Director Kunsevi. We shared the survey in two ways. We shared it on shrivery, and we also emailed every student with a PPS email account. That did take some time because we learned the hard way you can only send 2,000 emails at a time. So it took us a little bit of trial and error there, but we recognized that we needed to provide outreach in at least two different ways. I appreciate the question so much.

What the principals have reported is that the time during lunch and passing times are when you see the behaviors that we want to discourage. So I just have a question about that. I also had a question about that question that you asked two ways. And I'd like to be walked through it a little bit. I guess I had a hard time interpreting the results.

confidence: 0.96
F: Sure. Let's start with your second question first, Director DePass. So we asked two questions, and this was actually. I can't remember if it was one of our student members or Director Sullivan that asked about perceptions of stress. And so first we asked if your cell phone wasn't Basically, if your cell phone wasn't with you, do you feel an increase in stress? Then we asked if your cell phone wasn't with you, would you feel a decrease in stress? And so would you feel a decrease in stress? Question we had about 74% sex no to the would you feel increased stress without your device? We had about 54% say yes.

start time: 486:06:30.000
end time: 490:44:06.000
confidence: 0.94
H: The comment was about the time of use that when we heard from principals this summer, we heard that the behavior that we'd like to discourage happens during lunch and pass passing time. So that's just a comment about. That's. I'm trying to figure out how to reconcile that.

start time: 490:46:38.000
end time: 509:47:30.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Sure. The way I've been thinking about it, I'm thinking back to my own children's time in high school with devices is it feels clear to me that students from the results students want and desire ped free classrooms that the lack of distraction, the ability to increase focus is something that's desirable that then I believe leads them to want based on the results we have here when they aren't in instruction. Can I use my device? Now that is, as you said, a contrast to what building leaders have shared with us in terms of when is it most likely that students are on the devices and we're trying to interrupt that particular behavior. And that typically is during passing time, which you saw some of the comments from the focus group saying I got to class on time, I was spending less time in the hallway. So you can see that there's a little bit of conflict depending on how can where and where and when could there be flexibility versus where there cannot be flexibility?

start time: 509:57:10.000

H: And I guess one more comment about the difficulty of arranging, you know, to meet up with somebody. And I actually know someone that does not have a smartphone. And I asked her the same question, well, how do you meet at a bakery or whatever. And she said, well, we talk to each other, you know, the day before and we make an arrangement and that's how we meet. So I'm just suggesting it's an opportunity also to learn old ways of that are that still work.

confidence: 0.94
A: Anything else? So I had a couple questions and also some wonderings. So I was interested in the slide 7 that has the how students say they use their personal electronic device. And I was just wondering if we had some like super, super smart students that they would answer that they use it for classwork or instruction. Because that seemed in somewhat conflict of the anecdote. I mean they're both. Neither of them are scientific surveys of how things are used. But it seemed contrary to what teachers were saying and administrators were saying what phones were used for.

F: What I would share is definitely what we heard loud and clear from students is that at the classroom level expectations were not consistent. And so there were certainly classes where they could use their device and classes where they could not use the device. I could not say at this time exactly what they were using the device for other than these results that they then selected among the reasons or uses that they had for the devices. But certainly what came through loud and clear was the idea that if there is a policy that says there is some restrictions to personal electronic device usage, students want that policy to be enforced consistently. So expectations are clear.

C: Well, I remember Andrew last week saying his daughter loved her photography class and she used her cell phone for that. And I'm sure the journalism people are maybe walking around making notes on their cell phone. I don't know. But I can see it being used in class for sure.

G: Anecdotally from my experience that I had a lot of students that had a page up that had something to do with what we were talking about in class and Instagram. So immediately when I would walk by close by, it would flip to that page. It's like, look, I am actually doing work, so I don't know if that counts. That too.

A: Privacy screens are very vital too. So another wondering I had was when I looked at the current school or classroom policies, there was one school, this may be just like a follow up question, but there's one school that's a complete outlier with the other ones. Most of the schools had. The students responded that yes, they had a school policy and to a lesser extent classroom policies. And McDaniel was the sort of the exact opposite. 92% the students said they had classroom policies, but only 30% the school level. So I'm curious.

confidence: 0.94
A: That because I'm not certain just because it's the outlier. The rest of them are fairly consistent. So I'm just curious about that then. Just an observation. What the students were. I can get that later. The students stress when separated from the. From their phones. I was trying to think through about the underlying question because I think if I told my kids or maybe even myself, it's like you can't have, you won't have access to your phone. Like not at all. There might be a high degree of anxiety depending on what's happening. If it's like, well it's just in your backpack, like do you have that same sense of separation? So I was just curious about the, the wording and I hate to do this after, afterwards because I should have asked the question in advance. But I'm just wondering if there would have been a different. Like you're not really separated from it, it's just a way versus like it's off in a lockbox somewhere else.

start time: 594:31:46.000
end time: 608:58:30.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Sure, that's great feedback. We certainly in hindsight could have worded the question a little bit differently. But the idea that if I don't have immediate, you know, the good thing and the bad thing about cell phones is they provide immediate. I can immediately text my daughter or my son. I could video call them immediately and they could do the same to me at any given time. Given the three hour time difference between those they do. But I think there's also something to be said about how anxious do I feel at the thought of something versus over time, as I've gotten used to it, do I still feel that same level of anxiety or does that anxiety decrease? So that's just something I would offer to the committee.

confidence: 0.95
H: I have personal experience with an experience having my phone taken from me for five days and the watch too. And I can say I survived it. And it was very. At first there was some anxiety. And over time you just get used to not having your phone. And this was four or five days, not you got it back at night. So I think that's a really nice distinction. It'd be interesting to. I don't know if we can test on that, but I think people could survive a little bit of discomfort. But we're so used to it. I know that I would personally feel more comforted having it on my body, on my person.

start time: 620:36:20.000
end time: 636:53:20.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I mean based on some of the other responses, my assumption is that there'd be radiations of stress. So it sounds like students view yonder pouches. I mean it just looks like from the answers as more separated from like they can't get in it versus off and away which like even if there's a rule but if there were an emergency they actually could turn their phone on and access it. So less separated. So for me, like I say some of the other answers gave I think some like a temperature reading on really what Separated means how separated they felt. But depending on what the sort of mode of separate separation was, whether it was a real one or whether it was more a rule versus a physical separation.

I don't know if you had a chance or maybe I missed it, but was there any patterns between different, any things that kind of stuck out in terms of like, different implementations of restrictions? Like, for example, Lincoln had. Has the lock boxes. Right. And then, you know, Grant and Cleveland has the yonder pouches. In terms of the student responses, I don't know if you. Was there any patterns that kind of emerged out of that?

C: Yeah. And I was looking at the anxiety the other way, Julia. I was looking at it more. Are they less anxious because they have to worry about all these pings coming on their cell phone? And is it less anxious when you're actually away from that rather than being anxious that you don't have your phone? And the research pretty much shows that over time. And in fact, Peter Green, who testified, pretty much said that happens that you're just not so anxious about who's saying what about me. You're just in the, in the moment. But the answer was I'm. I wanted that question. And they definitely didn't necessarily think they'd feel less anxious.

I think we have Rose from Lincoln and Frankie from Franklin. Had to think about that here. And so we have about 10 minutes for this section just to share between the two of you, to share some perspectives. And I don't know how you want to divide the time or how you want to kick it off, but really a chance just to have, you know, get more student feedback as we move ahead with policy. So let Rose.

B: My name is Rose. I go to Lincoln High School. I'm a sophomore, and throughout my freshman year, like, I had my phone. It was off and away. I couldn't touch it. And I feel like there was just, like, a very. Like, there was like, a weird relationship between me and my phone because I really, really, really wanted to use it during class and stuff, and my screen time was super, super high. And at Lincoln, we are using the phone, and I feel like that is a great way that we have implemented the cell phone policy. I feel like in the use of, like, yonder pouches, it doesn't give me as much of, like, responsibility, because someday I'm gonna be an adult and I'm gonna have my phone with me, and I need to understand, like, not to, like, give in to these, like, urges to, like, use my phone. I feel like the cell phone caddy helps me because I get to put it away. And then in between, I'm like, okay, well, I can text my mom back and tell her I'm taking the bus, or I can use Apple Pay to pay during lunch. Like, it's. It's just really helped me because I've been able to, like, control my screen time, and I'm given this, like, responsibility to be able to have my PED on me.

start time: 713:53:00.000
end time: 720:37:18.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yes. So in each class, we are assigned a cell phone, like, number, and the caddies are all numbered, like, 1 through 30 or something. And you just place your phone in and then at the end and, like, the last one minute of class, like, you just grab and go pretty much. And then it just. It seemed like it's just been very fluent, and everybody's just been, like, getting it. Like, no phones have been stolen. Like, there hasn't really been any issues with it.

confidence: 0.96
B: Yeah, we have it during passing and lunch. And since we are off campus, we do, like, walk around a lot. And we're very close to downtown and we have a really huge homeless problem. My mom does not let me go off campus because of that. And I think that having my phone, you know, gives her a little extra security and me too, to be able to walk off campus.

I: Hi again. It's weird to be on the other side. So at Franklin, we have a pretty similar policy. I guess you all call them phone caddies. We know them as calculator holders. But the expectation is that in all your classes, like, that's what should be happening. That's the new policy we have implemented this year. I think that enforcement is definitely not the same across all of our classes. I think the majority of mine do have that where you walk in, you place it in one of those holders and you pull out a little slip that has a number on it. But there definitely are classes where that isn't enforced or there isn't even a holder. I think that this shows, like, a really interesting comparison, at least from my experience, because I've noticed that when I do have my phone away, I'm a lot more engaged in those classes. I am not feeling the constant urge to check my phone. And then in the classes where I still have access to it, I feel like I fall right back into my old habits. This is a pretty similar experience to a lot of the other students I've been speaking to. I think, like, the survey results have shown there is a lot of benefit to this and students see that. And I know, like, one thing on the anxiety point that I've been hearing is that a lot of times, like for different projects and things, there is the expectation that you're responding to text messages. And so it's kind of nice during school to have your phone away because then you're not having to worry about responding to those. Especially if that's the standard for everyone. People know that you're not going to be able to be responding. But I definitely agree with Rose on the point of having the phone during lunch. It's really nice for off campus lunch and it kind of gives you that moment in the middle of the day to check to make sure there's not anything actually important you're missing. And it definitely helps with coordinating lunch spots. And then also a big way we use it at school is we have a lot of student run clubs, so people use remind, which is like a Group messaging app where you can send these messages and announcements out to clubs. And so having the phones is nice because then you get a reminder of where club locations are. So I think that from what I've seen and when I've spoken to other students, definitely a strong vote in favor of having phones available during lunches. But I think that the phone caddy way during classes is really effective. And I think that it's also a lot more cost effective in comparison to yonder Pouches.

G: Frankie, can I ask you a question? And Rose too. One of the big issues that we hear a lot from a lot of teachers is that when it's not an all day and the, you know, students are taking, you know, going on restroom breaks supposedly. Right. And getting on their phones again and being out of the classroom and, you know, the. The issues with lunch as well is the use of the caddy. So I guess my question is this is the use of the caddies. Is that solving the problem for the in between time or. Sorry, sorry. Like kids taking restroom breaks to get on their phones and stuff like that. Because you're checking in your phone for the beginning of class and you don't get it till the very end, Right?

H: Be interesting to track.

start time: 791:48:12.000
end time: 801:26:06.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Yeah. Because one of the things that we hear from a lot about teachers where in schools that just have often away policies, right. No actual system, no caddies, no locks, no yonder, is that students are still finding ways to sneak out of class to use their phones, to check their text and social media stuff and whatnot. And that has been kind of causing a problem. And, you know, that reflects my experience as well, where you see a student take and then 10 minutes later they come back, it's like, where are you? But yeah, yeah, I feel.

start time: 801:27:18.000
end time: 808:43:36.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Oh, sorry. I feel that in that situation, it's the, you know, if a kid takes 10 minutes to go to the restroom, you know, that's when you like take their phone away from that. Like, you know, they were on their phone. But I feel like at my school the breaks have gotten shorter and kids have been taking less time and since like the phone is taken away, like, if you're taking 10 minutes in the restroom, then, you know, you just need to like, figure out your priorities.

start time: 808:46:48.000
end time: 817:46:10.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Yeah. I think one of the issues that part of the reason the caddy thing is appealing is also that it's it can create an awkward situation for a teacher to ask a student why they're gone for so long, because there could be actual, real reasons. And that. And that would, you know, if you have teachers constantly asking that that, you know, that that's kind of a recipe for some privacy issues. So I. I think that's. That's kind of where I was getting at, is that, you know, this is great because it solves one problem at least. Right?

start time: 818:09:50.000
end time: 826:25:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah. I'm just curious how you both, or all three of you feel about lunch with your phone. Do you feel like you're on it, you have to check it, or do you actually talk with your friends? Or are you only talking on your cell phone with your friends? Or. I don't know. I just hear so much about how lunchrooms are quiet and everybody's just sitting there looking at their phone. And does that happen, or is that just out there?

start time: 826:43:20.000
end time: 835:31:10.000
confidence: 0.96
I: I think that, honestly, when people say that, at least in my opinion, I think they're being a little overdramatic and kind of playing into all the stereotypes about teens. Like, at least in my friend group, we're very active. Like, people are excited for lunch because it's an opportunity to actually get to speak with your friends and especially speak with your friends who aren't necessarily in your classes. So students aren't sitting on their phones the whole time, or if they are, it's to communicate and let people know where they're eating that day. And at least my lunchroom, when I go in there and eat in the lunch line, it's very loud.

start time: 836:17:00.000
end time: 849:39:50.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I agree with Frankie on this. I feel like I've never heard my comments be quiet. But one thing is, I think that just giving them the option of the phone at lunch gives them a sense of responsibility and, like, what their priorities are, too, in that situation. Like, are your priorities to talk to your friends? Are they to text your friends? Are they to just be on your phone by yourself? Because I feel like one thing is that taking away the phone for, like, kids who, like, exactly have friends, you know, it's like the phone is, like, a nice distraction or whatever, but at the same time, not having it during lunch is like, okay, we're gonna get that kid to, like, meet some new people, but it's really hard to do that. And social media and texting and all that helps get kids to meet each other and, you know, create relationships.

A: Jj, Rose and Frankie, thanks for sharing your experiences and your thoughts about the policy. We look forward to your continued engagement. So as we move through the policy process, feel free to weigh in on any of the aspects. And with that I'm going to move to the next portion of the meeting regarding the policy which was there's a new draft that's been posted online that was available to and circulated among the committee members and actually all the board members. And how we came up with the draft is last meeting we asked, we went through a process by which we talked about what elements should be in policy and which elements were better left for the administrative directive. And then within those, the ones that should be in policy. There was a discussion about sort of some of the details but still like keeping it a very high level policy. So what we have and I'm going to walk through it and just get a general like thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideways, but try and get just a quick react to see whether we have. And I'm going to skip to A until the end because that might be the one that has the most discussion. But I think for most of the topics there was pretty clear agreement on what should be in policy and then what should be an administrative directive in terms of things that were more operational or budget issues. And then we tried to listen to each of the core elements of the policy and where we felt there was a majority of the board certainly wasn't uniformity across all measures. So just to start with, we have the framing comment, why are we doing this? Which really wasn't a question we had for the board. And then the second, then the very first policy is what the definitions are. And it seemed like that's just a standard part of policy. Like what are the. So we have a common set of terms, then we had general guidelines and as I said, I'm going to skip 2A and we'll come back to it but maybe we can just see how we did on the other ones and then have a longer discussion on 2A. And the 2A is sort of like what part of the school day does this apply to? And how. What's the district's approach? So 2B was really this, the notion of the district setting a floor for a policy and that giving individual schools the ability to go above and beyond sort of, I don't want to say the floor because that leaves the impression that it's a low level, but there's a. Thanks. Threshold or foundation. So there's a foundation. And then schools could go above and beyond. Does that seem to capture what people thought we were doing? So there's still some autonomy to have stricter but not less restrictive.

G: I guess my main concern is that, you know, I keep looking at what is the problem we're trying to solve. Right. And one of the. One of the things about personal electronic devices off, in a way, is already the current policy of most of our schools. And the teachers are asking for help with this current system that we already have. So one of the biggest problems that people keep referring to is that it's a power struggle. Right. The teachers have to constantly have these power struggles with students. So my personal preference would be something that's really strict and then it gives principals the right to grant exceptions. Like, for example, I would rather see something like off and away, bell to bell per school.

start time: 936:53:34.000

start time: 937:47:10.000
end time: 951:40:50.000
confidence: 0.94
G: Let me finish. But then there's an exception saying the principals may grant certain times that are allowable. For example, lunch. Because one of the things I've heard, especially in our middle schools, there's been middle schools, principals that I've talked to that have experimented both ways, having it during lunch and having it not during lunch. And a few of them have reported that the number of fights and bullying has gone up dramatically when they do allow it during lunch. So if we have something that's strict and then you can allow a principal is allowed to grant exceptions, then there's less of a power struggle, if that makes sense. Then the students have to blame us as the board. Right. Not their teachers and principals. And I'd rather have that. And then that kind of goes.

start time: 951:55:50.000
end time: 961:51:52.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Since we're in a committee meeting, it's just like a discussion. If you go that way, though, also if you allow exceptions, I think you probably run into. You haven't established any sort of floor. And so once again, you potentially could have just a patchwork of. Of things much lower than actually what you want. So what you may want to just put this out, but you may want to be arguing for is 2A to.

A: No, we're on 2B. Additional restrictions may be adopted by the school. So the question is, once we set a policy, do we want to have some sort of local, locally they can set a higher, like higher threshold or more additional restrictions.

end time: 989:05:40.000
confidence: 0.96
A: No, it's actually to have additional restrictions. So he's saying that's his point of view. I'm just saying the question then, if all the principals decided, for example, like we actually think students should be able to use them in most their classes at the board set a policy, but they also gave principals the flexibility to create exemptions and we think we should just exempt it. Like, would we be okay with that?

confidence: 0.93
G: Well, I mean, we could word it pretty vaguely so that they would also require. I don't know. There's super area supervisors. I think there's ways to work around it. I mean, I mean, to be honest, my preference would be bell to bell. But you know, Rose and Frankie gave pretty convincing arguments. I'm willing to think about that a little bit. But I'm still not completely convinced that my worry is that what we're looking at here, if I remember from the policies, from looking at the policies from all the schools, this looks just like the same policies that pretty much all schools one already have. And so now we're putting into policy. We're just basically elevating something that hasn't been working already into the, you know, the highest levels of.

start time: 1003:08:52.000
end time: 1022:02:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Okay, that's not actually what we're doing. We were asked by, I think the principals and the teachers, like, we want a district wide policy. So this is a district wide policy. And you can look at the. I mean I would look at this, this data point to show that lots of. There's a lot of variability. So hopefully this, this would. This, this chart that has classrooms and current school policies is every school and every classroom would now have a threshold which is clearly different from. From this. Okay, I'm going to move on since there's not from that one. So discipline. So we had a conversation that we're not going to set up a new discipline structure. We already have students rights and responsibility handbook. Is there any issue with this? Is what I heard the majority of the board. We heard the majority of the board say.

start time: 1022:37:10.000
end time: 1024:46:24.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah, I guess so. So each school would decide what the Discipline was if the policy was not carried out.

end time: 1030:38:20.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I don't know if I'm the compliance guru, but there's a matrix in the student rights and responsibility handbook. It is consistent practice or should be across the district, and it outlines the various infractions, from insubordination to.

confidence: 0.95

start time: 1042:50:30.000
end time: 1045:09:30.000
confidence: 1.00
B: I completely would. Because that means you're putting something in front of your education, which I believe is the most important thing and what you should be focusing on at school.

end time: 1052:28:46.000
confidence: 0.98
H: Ask about what we're trying to solve for. And we heard also, you know, when some of this research was being shared with us, that the kids that really need to be focused the most, you know, may have a harder time with impulse control. So that would be a concern of mine as well.

start time: 1052:29:58.000
end time: 1078:06:28.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Yeah, thanks for bringing. Yeah, exactly. And then so that. That brings up to my next question I have about the discipline. One thing I am a little concerned about is, like, for example, in middle school, where, you know, we know that kids have a little bit. Are still developing their impulse control. Right. I mean, some people never develop it. And when you're dealing with impulse control, when you're talking about smartphones, which, you know, majority apps out there are trying to sell you ads and trying to be as addictive as possible. Right. So that you keep check in. And when we have escalating levels of discipline and eventually it leads to confiscation. I am a little bit concerned about, like, some say, I know that, you know, it would be nice to have some exemption for the building administration administrator to be a little bit more lenient on this, because, like, for example, what if a kid has to walk home alone and they don't have their phone because their parent or guardian has to come pick it up? Those kind of situations would make me a little Bit worried, especially since we're talking about situations where students have less control over their impulses. And I guess that's where discipline gets a little tricky. But at the same time, should it be at the level of policy? I don't think so. I think this is up to the building administrator. So I think as long as we have some kind of. So I guess that's my question. Would it give enough leniency for building administrators to what.

start time: 1078:07:24.000
end time: 1081:28:00.000
confidence: 0.92
A: I think that's. I mean, we heard principals talked about that. I mean, it's school based and there is flexibility. And this disciplinarian looks like she wants to say something again. So.

start time: 1082:12:20.000
end time: 1083:47:20.000
confidence: 1.00
C: We have experts actually in the audience who can speak to.

end time: 1136:51:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Thank you. Appreciate it. It's on the spot expertise. The next portion of the policy was the exceptions categories. And I think there's actually an extra bullet point here. We talked about the exceptions being this complying with the student's IEP, the 504 plan, or other requirement to access the educational programming for communication. I think there's. This should just be one bullet point, right? Yeah. So that's. That's the first exception then. The second is supporting specific academic activities as determined by the building administrator. The third is application of the policy in the district's alternative Education programs and then the fourth as and others as defined by the superintendent, which are the so4 categories of exceptions that we defined before. Any questions about those?

start time: 1137:13:50.000
end time: 1141:11:22.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah, I think with my question on the exceptions, I think kind of going back to the additional restrictions that may be added by the building reader, does that mean, with that being in the policy, does that mean the principal has like the right to not follow these.

start time: 1141:11:46.000
end time: 1143:35:10.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Exceptions or do they default? These are universally applied exceptions.

start time: 1144:52:50.000
end time: 1145:46:34.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So a principal can't decide to not follow them. Just to be clear.

start time: 1145:48:02.000
end time: 1145:53:46.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Right.

start time: 1145:54:58.000
end time: 1176:29:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So if a student needed it for its IEP or follow 504 plan like that, that's a district exception, not something that's being, that's, that's why we're calling them out in the policy. And again this, this, this policy should be giving guidance not just to students, families, staff, but also to building administrators. And again, high enough level and there will be implementing language that's in more detail in the administrative directive. But the answer to your question is no. Jj these would not be, could not be overridden by a building administrator. Although I'll say one of them is giving authority to a building administrator to make exceptions. And that would be something like the examples that are given like an art class where you're using your phone or student newspaper. Yeah, student newspaper, all those types of things. The next one provision is no bullying, harassment or taking photographs or videos of others without permission. This is really just a restatement in our policy. We could take this section out in some ways because we have other policies that cover it. But I thought it was useful to have it here to say like here's, here's some. If you're going to be using your personal electronic device.

start time: 1177:08:10.000
end time: 1177:58:10.000
confidence: 0.91

start time: 1179:12:58.000
end time: 1184:15:00.000
confidence: 0.98
H: I think one of the things when we were reviewing the list of different school policies is that some of them had a training at the beginning of the school year. And I really like that idea that talked about this is how, I mean to make the, the practice clear on how your phones can be used.

start time: 1184:30:40.000
end time: 1185:18:48.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So I would assume that is an implement.

start time: 1185:21:44.000
end time: 1186:05:12.000
confidence: 0.96
H: We don't want to tell people to do that, but I just say best practice.

start time: 1186:06:16.000
end time: 1204:55:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, I think that's a great idea. And that would be. My assumption is just like I think at the schools that had sort of new policies this year that they had a lot of training around it. So just to get back to here, this the first bullet point on harassment and bullying. This is already covered in Our other policies, but a statement just expectations to students. And the second one, while it's not a policy, certainly at the beginning of the school years, when people make their preference known about whether they want to be in photos or videos, we have a basic practice of if somebody doesn't want their image used, that it's not. So this is a school day statement versus a school activity. Like if you go to a football game or a soccer game, the expectation may be you may be photographed and nobody's going to ask you for your permission. But if somebody's going to take your picture in the hallway, the expectation that you have a right to your image.

end time: 1210:03:40.000
confidence: 0.95
G: I think, yeah, I just have the way it's worded, it's a little confused because, you know, it starts with students may not take videos or photos during school activities or otherwise use their personal. But the question is, does that mean students may not take videos or photos during school activities.

start time: 1210:50:40.000
end time: 1211:10:16.000

start time: 1212:00:10.000
end time: 1216:02:30.000
confidence: 0.94
G: I think the or is what's confusing me because it sounds like two separate, you know, you can't go swimming or you can't go walking. Right. You may not take photos or you can't use it to bully is it can't take photos to bully.

start time: 1216:12:10.000
end time: 1217:28:02.000
confidence: 0.94

A: Okay, great. So I'm going to go back to 2:2a. And the essence of there's sort of two pieces of this. One, what there's a couple things we could do with students phones. We could say you can't bring them to school. They could be like, they can't be present. Or you could say off and away and you could say they're like on and away or I mean there's the spectrum. So that's one piece is like what are the phones there? Are they present? Are they on? You know, where are they? Are they allowed? And then the second is what parts of the school experience. And that could be when I say school experience, that could be, you know, before school, all the way through after school. Okay, so what period are we covering? I thought I heard at the besides my phone thought I heard a majority of the board supporting off and away. And during a majority board also for classrooms, what wasn't during class time, there were a variety of opinions. So I think there was sort of universality of like, not. Not during class time. There were a variety opinions of whether to cover passing time and also lunchtime. Because I also thought I heard no before and after school was fine. So it really came to me, it came down to these sort of two time period. So we're going to allow during lunchtime and also during passing time.

F: Yeah, I think definitely allowing during lunchtime. And a question I would like to pose so that the board is if we don't allow phones during lunchtime, how will we ensure safety for high school students who eat off campus? And I know Rose has something to say, so chair, I'm wondering if that's fine, if she shares something.

B: Hi. So earlier today and last week, I collected some data from my school and my classes. I talking to freshmen through seniors. And I was just talking like, would you rather have yonder pouches, like phone caddies, or just not bring your phone to class? And a lot of kids responded with, well, if they implement yonder pouches, I would rather just leave my phone at home. Like, there is no point in bringing my phone to school if I'm not even allowed to have it. And I feel like that's just a very valid point. And if. If I were to leave my phone at home because I, you know, don't want to be. To give it away or whatever to administration, would I then, like, be allowed to use the restroom? Would I be allowed to, like, leave campus like what is like the rules around that if that was implemented.

start time: 1312:04:10.000

A: Great, thank you. So I think I have some follow up to do with Director Green to see where he is. I also will want to hear.

A: Little bit more from after now that this draft is out from Director Scott and also from the superintendent or her designated staff about the given there is a division and board, if there's some some additional information that we should be considering.

start time: 1324:58:10.000

G: Director Hollins has his hand up.

A: Oh, Director Hollins.

start time: 1326:23:30.000
end time: 1335:10:00.000
confidence: 0.89
F: Oh yes. I just have one quick question for the book for us, you know, we do, you know, away all day. What kind of support are we going to give? Equitable support. Are we going to give the schools to be able to implement that? And the reason why I say that because if my assumption is if one school has John and Palchis, then if all schools want yonder colleges, how are we going to support that as a board with our budgetary restraints that we have?

start time: 1335:53:50.000
end time: 1354:46:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, I appreciate that question Director Hollins, because I will just say the current often away during the school day other than lunch does allow schools the flexibility to implement it in different ways, whether it is the phone caddy or the yonder pouches. And I'm just gonna say me personally, I'm not willing to mandate one particular tool for enforcement and one that actually creates cost us resources and I don't know that it's actually needed.

start time: 1355:36:00.000
end time: 1362:42:10.000
confidence: 0.93
F: I guess my question is so for instance the school's enforcement is going to be based on the resources they have. So, so for instance Grant can use 60 grand or whatever the amount is to buy yonder pouches. Roosevelt maybe not. So are we going to have inequities with that? And if we are, how we as a board since we're making the policy, how will we level out those inequities when they come up?

start time: 1362:55:10.000
end time: 1365:17:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yeah, I guess that's if we mandated a particular tool for enforcement.

start time: 1365:36:00.000
end time: 1370:19:00.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Well we are saying, well if say for instance, if the majority of us says okay, we want it to be, you know, away and the schools have to enforce away all day, what mechanisms will they have that we will support for them to do that is my question.

start time: 1370:40:00.000
end time: 1374:08:20.000
confidence: 0.91
A: So right now, right now the away could be stored in a locker, backpack, purse, pocket. So school at their place or other place where the device is not on, visible or in use.

start time: 1374:57:20.000
end time: 1380:36:20.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Sorry, I guess I'm looking at the piece that they the some of the policies that they already have which does that anyway. What's going to be different from what the school stuff does now with their policies versus what we're implementing if we're not going to be supporting if they want to do something more restrictive.

start time: 1381:10:00.000
end time: 1387:31:40.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Yeah, I think that's why it's important for in the draft policy letter F. Equitable support for schools. In the draft policy, it does say the district shall provide equitable support to schools to implement this policy. So I think that's a good question. I think that's something that maybe if this policy is passed, something that the district leadership would have to figure out.

start time: 1388:02:00.000
end time: 1392:17:00.000
confidence: 0.96
F: I just want to make sure we're clear because that's the budget committee. We're going to be responsible for the funding for that. Whether it's, you know, the district allocating funds from one area to the other. I just want to make sure we're clear on that and we're okay with that as well.

start time: 1394:52:50.000
end time: 1406:20:00.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Do you think staff would want to come with a point of view not necessarily on. You could come with on something around the supports, but also just the often away. What portion. What portion of the school day. Sorry, Gary, I'm talking to. I just, I'm just asking staff if they would want to come with a perspective on the. Which part of the school day. The whole day or portions of it.

start time: 1406:38:20.000
end time: 1410:52:50.000
confidence: 0.90
F: Yeah, I guess I'll kind of ask that too. Like what kind of economic impact would this policy or potential economic impact that policy could have if we did all day. That we pass all day policy. Thanks.

start time: 1411:06:30.000
end time: 1431:19:54.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yes, I think that that's exactly the question. And also I'd like just the. Since there's a division board just like what the perspective of the superintendent and the sort of school leadership would be interested in. And. And just see Director Scott, I know you're just here for the next meeting, but we. Yeah, well, we're wrapping up here. We are going to ask. There is not necessarily consensus on the board on what part of the school day to have the restrictions in place. And what I heard last meeting was consensus on class time. Like no phones. Okay to have phones before and after school. And so we're down to passing time and lunchtime. And I was quoting you, I think, as saying that at least initially you were open to lunch, but maybe you can get there to a lunch time restriction, but you indirectly.

start time: 1431:20:42.000
end time: 1436:38:08.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Yeah, I honestly don't remember what I said last time, so. But I'm sure someone could check the tape. I. Yes, I agree with everything you said. I'd like to delve a little bit deeper into the. There are good reasons to restrict it all day. I've also heard some compelling reasons for giving access during lunch. So I'm undecided on that issue.

start time: 1436:40:24.000
end time: 1480:50:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yeah. And we had, and maybe we can figure out a way to capture the presentation. We had both Rose from Lincoln and Frankie from Franklin presents some student in addition to the survey that we had from Dr. Adams. Also some just school based and student leader feedback on that. Okay. So I think we are down to a much narrower set of issues. Committee generally agree. I mean we have a big issue outstanding, but we're, we've narrowed it down and we're going to get Director Hollins some, I'm going to say, feedback, maybe staff input and perspective on the sort of equitable supports. Is that any. Anything else outstanding? He wanted cost figures, potential cost figures is what I heard. I think that would be the range, which we should be. Yes, yes. So for example, now we have, I mean all the schools have some sort of policy and we, we know that most of them, maybe not McDaniels, but most of them have a mechanism which during class time they're utilizing. So we should have costs from that. Like how much the lockboxes or the Caddies at Lincoln cost versus Franklin. Sounds like Franklin. They didn't do it the whole school. So if you had it, if this is going to be like every classroom, like what would, what would that cost be? And I think, you know, to Director Holland's point, like this isn't just the high schools. So we also have our. I think I would want from staff also. So to their perspectives on middle schools, I should be actually very clear that I don't think for myself. I'm all about often away all day for middle schoolers. They don't leave campus. To me, there's no reason for them to use their phones during lunch. Okay.

start time: 1488:54:50.000
end time: 1494:54:30.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Yeah, so on the equitable support sections, I hear like one of the issues, I hear a lot oftentimes from students is, you know, at schools, you know, we're having a Chromebook shortage. Chromebooks are constantly breaking down and sometimes students are being told to just use their phones instead if they don't have a Chromebook to use. So I was wondering, will the district provide, you know, fully working Chromebooks to every student?

B: I wanted to comment on the middle school phone policy. I feel like it's very important to have a middle school phone policy because it's really hard going into middle school and just, you know, having your phone like off and away all day, but like, you know, you can still access it to suddenly you have your phone, but it's like in a pouch where like, you can't touch it and stuff. Whereas, like, the Caddy would be an easier transition.
