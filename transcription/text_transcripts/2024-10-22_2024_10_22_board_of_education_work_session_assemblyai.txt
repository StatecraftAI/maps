A: Now be transitioning into our work session. Good to go. All right. We are transitioning to our work session for the superintendent evaluation template. At the September 24th work session to review superintendent's performance evaluation template, we reviewed initial draft template that Vice Chair DePass and I drafted. After initial conversations with Superintendent Armstrong. At that work session, we heard feedback from you that you wanted to focus the evaluation on our adopted goals. This draft has incorporated that feedback as well as provide more details on the competencies. We are looking for the superintendent to demonstrate based on the criteria identified by the community in the superintendent search process. Tonight, I hope we can agree on a template and decide on the timeline and the cadence for any check ins throughout the year. Our final step would be to approve this at our next board meeting. So now's the time to. Let's talk about our. The evaluation template. Hold on one sec.

C: Okay. Shall we? If we have questions time now.

start time: 22:39:58.000
end time: 22:48:38.000

A: Yes.

start time: 22:50:14.000
end time: 27:54:10.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Okay. On the percentages on all of the different goals. I'm just wondering how we got to those, what they mean as far as.

start time: 28:36:30.000
end time: 29:43:58.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Bringing up to different standards.

start time: 29:46:54.000
end time: 30:14:50.000
confidence: 0.98
D: I have that same question.

start time: 30:27:50.000
end time: 30:37:02.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Sure.

start time: 30:38:46.000
end time: 30:49:30.000
confidence: 0.82
F: So.

start time: 31:26:30.000
end time: 38:21:50.000
confidence: 0.97
E: What I believe I heard at the last board meeting where this was discussed was a desire to have some kind of percentages to go with the rankings. And what I did, since the board goals are the same was use the same percentage point increases that we had in the previous superintendent's evaluation for your consideration instead of creating a whole new scale.

start time: 38:42:10.000
end time: 39:45:14.000
confidence: 0.90
D: May I ask Art, do you have a question about that? Because I had a question about.

start time: 39:48:02.000
end time: 42:20:30.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Yeah, well, just how you figure it, because I know we want the gap to decrease. So how you figure that these percents.

start time: 42:27:30.000
end time: 52:14:10.000
confidence: 0.97
E: The way this worked with the previous evaluation structure is that we looked at the sum total of all of the student groups and how much the entire targeted group of students moved. Another way to think about it, and I don't want to keep lobbing softballs at you, another way to think about it is to think about whether each student group and each goal moves and meets the target or not. That's just a different way to think about it. It would be up to this board to decide which way they wanted to look at it. And then we could design something that would meet that need.

start time: 53:20:30.000
end time: 55:14:10.000
confidence: 0.99
C: So that would be the whole group of, say, Pacific Islanders move as a group, 5% each.

start time: 55:32:30.000
end time: 60:20:30.000
confidence: 0.95
E: It would be the whole group of. For example, if we look at high school graduation, it's the entire targeted group of students. So the African American student group, the Pacific Islander student group, our native student group, and our Latinx students in totality.

start time: 61:23:30.000
end time: 62:16:10.000
confidence: 0.88
D: So not disaggregated by racial group.

start time: 62:18:10.000
end time: 66:31:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: No, we still would disaggregate it, but we would calculate a total for the targeted student group in the goal and we would show you the individual movement of each group as well as the entire targeted group. Student groups movement.

start time: 67:31:30.000
end time: 82:44:30.000
confidence: 0.93
D: I was wondering if it would be beneficial to even divide it up anymore and have like a scale. In other words, you know, on, let's say priority number one, third grade reading, African American students by 5.5 percentage points. What if between zero and 5.5, could there be categories that would be easier for us to use that rating scale? Exceeds expectations, meets expectations, partially meets, does not meet 1, 2, 3. There's four categories within there. Does it make sense to add a numerical scale? If performance is increased by 1.5 to 1.8%, that means, you know, you're. You're partially meeting expectations.

start time: 83:02:10.000
end time: 83:19:50.000
confidence: 0.85
F: So that is.

start time: 83:27:30.000
end time: 91:51:22.000
confidence: 0.97
E: That is possible if you also wanted to. The only thought that I'm having off the top of my head is you then end up with at least 20 gradings because each student group would have a rating and so you'd have 20 ratings at least. That's just my rough math through the four board goals. And I don't know if that would be the board's desire or not, but we certainly could design it as such.

start time: 91:54:26.000
end time: 98:13:24.000
confidence: 0.91
D: I think overall, I'm looking at. I know when you want to set some up for success. So that's what I'm trying to get at really kind of clarity around what does exceeds expectations mean versus does not meet expectations and do we assign a numerical value to that or otherwise? I'm not sure.

start time: 98:16:12.000
end time: 105:05:00.000
confidence: 0.89
F: Can I help? Yeah. Because I'm a little bit concerned, George. And best that it actually might have the opposite effect. I'm concerned about creating a formula, a mathematical formula for performance evaluation. And I think, you know, I am in. These are. These are our board goals. So, you know, I think it's important to note them even I know.

start time: 105:05:40.000
end time: 105:16:00.000
confidence: 1.00
E: Prior.

start time: 105:36:20.000
end time: 130:52:20.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Sorry, my thing's not staying on, so I have to hold the button down. Prior, as we did this, and I noticed this was still in here. It was. One of the questions I was going to raise tonight is I actually even wonder if it's on page four where we sort of know the, you know, proficiency change. Zero to one is. Does not. One to two is partially meets. And I guess for me, I feel like it's important to have our board goals. It's important to measure progress against them. The evaluation of the superintendent is about, you know, how well we're doing against those board goals, for sure. There's also a lot of other factors. There's pandemics, there's state funding. There's other sort of issues going on that may accelerate or may hamper sort of those growth. And I think that's where the qualitative aspect of a performance evaluation comes in. And my fear would be making it very quantitative, like, you know, this is the evaluation. If we have this, I would much rather see, you know, the board come back together at the end of the evaluation period. And obviously we've seen tremendous growth and meeting expectations. But if we've seen minimal growth by superintendent of the team, you know, have really good explanations for that or can point to growth in Portland being higher than it is in other similar districts or other things, we still may come to the, you know, conclusion that the superintendent is doing a really good job, even though mathematically may not have met sort of all those targets. So for me, that's where I think the qualitative aspect of this comes in. I would, I wouldn't want to go more quantitative.

start time: 130:59:20.000
end time: 138:18:52.000
confidence: 0.94
D: And I think that this rubric, this rubric here probably serves that purpose anyhow. It does have a proficiency change percent. The only other thing comment I had was in our priority number two on fifth grade mathematics, we just have a small error, clerical error, where it says our goal is to close the opportunity and outcome gaps for third grade reading and it would just be changed to fifth grade.

start time: 138:19:56.000
end time: 138:30:40.000
confidence: 0.72
F: Yes.

start time: 138:57:40.000
end time: 139:22:00.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Thank you for catching that.

start time: 139:37:50.000
end time: 139:54:30.000
confidence: 0.82
D: And can I just clear?

start time: 139:55:10.000
end time: 152:22:20.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Because actually, I just want to be clear directly. Pass. I actually want to get rid of that box on page four. And the reason. I'll just try and make it a little bit more simple. If we have 4% growth and it automatically exceeds expectations, but every other district in Oregon has 10% growth, I'm going to have some real questions. Similarly, if we have 1% growth, but every other district in Oregon has minus 5% growth, I'm going to have a different set of questions and a different evaluation. And for me, I would want to preserve. I don't want to be stuck in this. Oh, well, the mathematical formula told me I have to rate the superintendent here because I think there's lots of other factors I'm going to want to take into account depending on where we end up with student achievement.

start time: 152:34:40.000
end time: 154:50:30.000
confidence: 0.92
D: I would be supportive of that as well. For that reason, just because of that flexibility, it adds. And you're suggesting just removing that rubric.

start time: 155:02:50.000
end time: 189:48:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, I would actually be supportive wanting to remove that rubric as well. I think one of the issues I have and I kind of see both your points because having a qualitative like Director Scott, like you said, is important because we're also comparing to other states and stuff. We also know that this superintendent has to meet this. We have the same expectations for, with $70 million less funding than previous superintendents. Right. And so I guess my qualm with it. But one of the, I think one of the points that really resonated with me that Director Tapas brought up was like one of the values of rating systems is that it allows you to kind of focus where the, you know, the next following year to focus on where areas to work on, which ones you can kind of let like go. Like give you example. Like for example, baseball players have stats, right. How many times you're hitting percentage and how many times they strike out and things like that. And so when you see like a baseball player have great hitting percentage, but they got a ton of strikeouts, they know what to work on for next year. Right. And again, I don't want to, like you said, I don't want to go into numerical. So nothing like that. But my, my qualm is that when we have something like wording that says like meet expectations, I'm a little worried about what expectations mean and if that can be used in a punitive way because one of the things I don't want this to become is a punitive process where like we have the superintendent doesn't meet expectations and that gives who knows who the future board is. Right. Some kind of leverage to get rid of someone they don't want just because they don't like them, not because of performance. Right. And so if there's any, I would like to move in some kind of direction where it's not punitive but more focused on growth wording that matches growth. And that's kind of direct. To pass the part, your argument, the part that really resonated with me.

start time: 191:24:10.000
end time: 192:59:10.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Yeah, I guess we want a tool that elicits success. It's just. How do we define that?

start time: 193:56:10.000
end time: 202:00:00.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Well, why don't we define it by. I mean, we've got all these percentages up here we can look at. I don't really see how that graph on page four would even be able to because the goals are. The percents are different for each area. So what are we looking at in that, in that rectangle there? I don't get it. And I just don't think it's necessary.

start time: 203:13:40.000
end time: 207:12:54.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Question. Just a clarification. The let's Just take the African American students by 5.5% points. That's from the OSAS data that just was released.

start time: 207:15:02.000
end time: 208:04:38.000
confidence: 0.93
E: No, these are the. This is from the board goals document.

start time: 208:07:34.000
end time: 211:21:58.000
confidence: 0.93
B: No, but we're basing the 5.5 percentage point increase. It would be the OSAS data that just got.

start time: 211:24:14.000
end time: 212:21:40.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Oh, you mean going forward. Yes, yes.

start time: 212:36:40.000
end time: 255:44:44.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Okay. So recommendation recommendations. That one. We actually. Because we know that now that we put that in there. Because to me, the five. Like, what is our baseline? I think actually the last valuation template we had had a nice sort of thing, so you could start seeing some trend lines. But, like, we should get that baseline data in to whatever template we're approving. This is just my point of view. I would give the board almost a whole year to have a conversation with the superintendent about what the rating system is like, because to me, at the end of this first year, it just is going to be what it is. And I'm not sure it's necessarily indicative of. Again, I think it's. You've got a former superintendent's budget and teams. And so from my perspective, I think the first year. And I think this is what we did with Superintendent Guerrero, like, the first year was more like we're establishing the baseline and we. There was some qualitative. There was discussion about some qualitative leadership pieces in the valuation, but it was like Superintendent Guerrero wasn't going to be owning the previous years. Superintendents, we're establishing a baseline, and then the expectation is like, you're laying the foundation. You get your team, this is your budget, and the next year you're. You own the data. I mean, to the extent you own it. So I guess I appreciate the discussion about the ratings, but I'm not sure in the first year that you can do much besides set the baseline and be transparent about it. Then I'm just gonna repeat again. I think the high school graduation we somewhat got away from our initial discussions we had were high school graduation rates with these other data points about college and career readiness as actually better indicators of actually maybe proficiency and like, readiness for people's next step. And it just seems like it's just dropped off. So.

start time: 255:47:32.000
end time: 260:10:52.000
confidence: 0.93
E: So that's not my recollection, Director. What I recall on the board's goal document was these four goals, plus the commitment to the board to report on post secondary readiness, not that post secondary readiness and associated goals were a part.

start time: 260:11:16.000
end time: 260:28:44.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Of the board goals.

start time: 260:30:52.000
end time: 263:20:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And so what we've done is whenever we have our graduation data, we always put. That's the time that we have also have the post secondary readiness data that we can share with the board.

start time: 264:08:30.000
end time: 280:28:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I never want to disagree with your recollection. My recollection is that AJ Said we shouldn't have like multiple points. He was very opposed to having multiple data points. And so since we've gone away from the last couple templates we had, I don't want to lose that because to me, I. I don't want to say it's. It's. It's not. Definitely not meaningless. But it also to me is not necessarily an indicator about whether our students are proficient and ready for their next steps. So I just make a case that we have something more robust than just high school graduation.

start time: 280:53:40.000
end time: 286:06:30.000
confidence: 0.90
D: So I would be in favor of that as well. I think the graduation rate tells us one story and it's like how many kids got in for the finish line? I think the data that you're asking for is are our kids ready to succeed at whatever they do? College, career and life afterwards, I think for me would be more meaningful.

start time: 286:09:10.000
end time: 300:26:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And I thought we had some pretty good measurements in ways like for students to show their brilliance in different ways. Not just like academics, but also with the seal of biliteracy. We had the CTE strands and also the art strands. Again, for me, it's a better indicator than like as part of the superintendent's evaluation of like we're doing more than just looking at graduation rates. But really, are students ready? So just something for consideration and I don't know or even like it's an appendix to the evaluation. Just the data. Because separating it out then creates this. It's like it becomes, I don't know, irrelevant or it's just not connected to anything.

start time: 300:48:20.000
end time: 304:04:40.000
confidence: 0.97
C: How is that going to be judged? Or how do you see it by individual reports? The students do or.

start time: 304:13:40.000
end time: 310:58:10.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Well, you can basically you. You can. And you look at disaggregated data. It actually tells you a lot. It tells me. It tells me a lot more than it than just a graduation rate where, you know, people. Students sat in the class have got at a minimum a D. Whereas if you're earning either dual credit AP ib, it's like you're taking rigorous academic.

start time: 311:09:10.000
end time: 313:01:24.000
confidence: 0.91
C: So you'd look at number of A's and you also classes people took that kind of thing on it.

start time: 313:01:32.000
end time: 329:28:14.000
confidence: 0.93
B: That's what the measurement is. And then also we measure the CLL by literacy. So another way for students to show like a different type of brilliance, we also looked at. I forget the statistics. If Chris Brita was here, he could say it. But like the connection between completing a CTE strand and sort of future success or how that correlates with graduation. Like that. That was another one. And you can see it's like it used to be 15 years ago. It's like, oh, this high school offers very little CTE and they just have advanced place classes or IB classes. And so really, I think part of looking at the data is what are we offering to our students? That all students have an opportunity whether to engage in either rigorous academic courses or again, places, career type.

start time: 329:29:02.000
end time: 331:25:18.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Yeah. So that's what. Looking at what schools are offering is different than how many students complete those.

start time: 331:27:34.000
end time: 340:14:06.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Right. The data that Dr. Adams has provided us. And we could show you some past what it shows, like how many students got. I think it was like a three or better on the AP course or a five and an IB course, or completed three classes in a CTE strand or earned their seal of biliteracy, which is a thing which is measurable. It's not just like, okay, that's what I was wondering.

start time: 340:15:58.000
end time: 340:52:50.000
confidence: 0.99
C: So is it measurable? Fairly easily.

start time: 341:36:50.000
end time: 341:44:26.000
confidence: 0.54
B: No.

start time: 341:45:38.000
end time: 341:57:50.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Okay.

start time: 343:04:50.000
end time: 348:38:02.000
confidence: 0.94
F: On this point, really quickly, I think it's a really interesting conversation. My only hesitation is this is our board goal, which is why it's included in the zoom or not evaluation. I think it's a really worthy conversation. If the board wants to change or add the board goal around high school graduation. I think that conversation is going to take some time to develop exactly what we're measuring, what the data is and what that looks like.

start time: 348:38:26.000
end time: 348:40:48.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So.

start time: 348:41:14.000
end time: 353:58:00.000
confidence: 0.93
F: So I would be nervous about waiting to finish that before finalizing the superintendent's evaluation. I would move forward with our board goal. I think if the board chooses to change that board goal sometime between now and the future, we can always come back and revisit with the superintendent whether we want to also change the evaluation. But for me, they're kind of separate conversations.

start time: 354:37:00.000
end time: 369:32:20.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Because I also think that this is just a benchmark year that sort of no harm, no foul to have the conversation. But I'm just concerned because it has become disconnected. And then it's like, look where we are in graduation rates. And to me, that doesn't measurably tell me anything because it's like, oh, the graduation rates are great, but, like, look at the other. The other data. It's like all of a sudden they become profound, efficient at high school, or they got weeded out when you look at eighth grade and they're not doing very well. So to me, it just. It's not a meaningful measurement. And again, it's because in my mind, this is a sort of reset year, not like setting the baseline. That's why I would like to reconnect it.

start time: 371:17:30.000
end time: 442:15:36.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Alright, so there I want to say a couple of things and I've just been listening and so I'm wanting to address a lot of things that I've been hearing from my perspective. The first one that I'd like to address is that we keep asking about like where the percentages come from and we keep acknowledging that it was set under the old regime, that it was the last superintendent. But with that I also want to know that although the superintendent left, a lot of the team that was here when we were making those percentage points are still here. So a lot of the team that the old superintendent would have went and talked to about what numbers are we going to come up with, what measurement tool we're going to use. A lot of that team that would have given him recommendation because we all know he wouldn't have made that by himself. He would have went to his team and that team came back with something. And so that team is still here. So I don't want us to get in this space where we try to wash it out in that, you know, that was the old team and this is the new team. Because what's consistent in all of this is our kids are behind. Which is going to lead me to my next thought around this being a. And I'm sure that this isn't what you're meaning about like the reset and establishing a baseline and. But when I hear these types of words, I start thinking how many more baseline years or reset years can our kids afford before they're not in our system anymore? How many more kids are going to walk out of our high school unable to read, which happens often. We don't want, we don't want to say that, but unfortunately if we look at our data that is, you know, 20, 25 years old, then it shows that we have a historical pattern of graduating kids who are not proficient. How many more years can we afford to continue this process of graduating unprofession kids? And I don't believe that this is. Establish a new baseline. I don't believe that this is a reset. I believe this is a. She took this job knowing that it was going to be tough. She's sitting right here. I'm not saying anything to anybody that I wouldn't say to the individual's face. You took this job understanding the parameters and which our school district was. I'm sure that she did some research. She herself was Part of the old. The old team. So there's a lot that she understood coming into about our district. She also understood that our kids cannot afford another reset year. They cannot afford another establish a baseline year. What our kids need is the bar to be high, and it needs to stay there because we're. We can't lower the bar and expect high expectations. Which leads me to a. One of the things. And again, I know this isn't what you were saying or what you were getting to. When we start talking about the proficiencies and then the 1% and the 10% and having different thoughts or whatever. I don't care if we have 1% and everybody else is negative. I'm not celebrating trash. I mean, it's like if it's the. Who cares if you're the king of the garbage pile? It's still the garbage pile. I'm trying to get our kids out of that. And we have to do that by setting a standard, maintaining a high standard. We brought in a qualified individual who I believe likes challenges, wants to be pressed. And if I'm not mistaken, I get the impression that she wants a mark that she can hit and then knock it out of the park. I don't believe she would be comfortable with the 5.5. I believe she wants to get a 10. And there's no part of me that thinks that we should lower it by any shape, form, or the imagination. I like the idea. I mean, I hear what everybody is saying about, like, you know, the meet succeeds and this and that. I want to make sure that we're all clear on one thing.

start time: 442:16:48.000
end time: 442:26:22.000
confidence: 0.71
B: Be.

start time: 442:28:56.000
end time: 473:44:14.000
confidence: 0.96
G: The goal has to be maintaining a high standard of learning and rigor. We never let it down. We never surrender. We never give up, and we never go backwards. And so this is not a reset year, and we have to stop saying it. This is not an establish the baseline year. We have to stop saying it. This is a. You know where we are. We brought you in so that you can help fix it. You got a whole data team, you got a whole research team that knows how to research where we are. They can give you all the history on where we've been and all the different things that we've tried and let's do something. But this is not a space for reset. I'm not going to be okay with kids being unable to read. I'm not going to be okay with our kids leaving our district, going to other places because we're resetting every time we get a superintendent. I'm never going to be okay with that. And we have to say that out loud. The standard has to be. And I believe it'll help us if we change the language from all kids should be able to read to all kids will be able to read if we change that one word from should, which means we tried to will, meaning that we're holding everybody accountable all the way down the line, from the student to the educator to the administrator, all the way up to the superintendent, because crap rolls downhill. So if we're going to hold her accountable, then she's got to hold the administrators accountable. If she's going to hold them accountable, then they have to hold the educators accountable. Everybody has to get it. This is not a space for, you know, we need to be concerned about their feelings. I just don't. I'm not concerned about their feelings. I'm concerned about our kids being able to read. And I believe I answered all of my. All of my little points that I put down. But outside of saying this is a definite harm if our kids can't read, and it's a complete foul if we don't stay focused on the goal.

B: Director Green, I appreciate your comments. I just want to respond to them, though, because I don't think in any way by saying this is a setting, a baseline year is set. We don't want our kids to read. And I will say what I think is somewhat unfair is on July 1, before the very first meeting of this board and all summer and almost every single agenda setting meeting, I've asked for us to have, like, settle the evaluation because there's no job I've been in where midway through the year, all of a sudden I get my goals. And we are now at the end of October, and this is like, I would say, like a failure of the board and the institution to, like, set this at the very beginning, because I think we're four months, four months into it, is that, you know, all of a sudden, like, and now you have seven months to go accomplish these objectives. And so I'm not. I don't think any. I don't think there's anybody at this table who wants to lower the standards. I'm also like, we need to have a fair process. And this is why we should have a calendar. And at the beginning of the year, the template should be set so the superintendent exactly know, just like we do with our students, like, here's how you're going to be, you know, midway through the school year, it's like, hey, we're going to change the grading system or we're going to set new targets. I mean, students would be like, that's not fair. So that's what I'm trying to communicate. Not a lowering of standards or a lessening of expectations, but really, really, we're not going to be approving this until November, and I think that we should be taking into account.

But just so we're clear, the draft that we're drafting here is actually for the 25, 26 year, and we still have to talk about what we're going to do for this year. But. Yeah, Director Hollins? Yeah, Director Hollins.

H: So two things. One, I want to hear from my superintendent because this is supposed to be a cold creation from the board and the superintendent. And I haven't heard from Dr. Armstrong yet, so I would definitely want to hear from her and her thoughts as well. I sent Chair Wong a. Some of my thoughts. I didn't know if I'll be here to be here tonight, but I sent up some of my thoughts on some of the things. And this actually came out of a conversation that I had with Dr. Armstrong at the Council of Grayson City Schools conference, which was actually a great, great conference. One of the things we try to do is try to really make it simple and concise. One of the things that. And I will share this with everyone as well, or Director Long, if you can share this with everyone, that would be great. With Director Green was saying, as far as wanting targets and wanting a number to shoot for, it's not necessarily a bad thing. It is also with. With Director Wong was standing around, we want to make this. This evaluation not as a positive correction document versus a punitive document. And so with all those things and taken into consideration, we looked at having our three goals. You know, one was our board goals that would be weighted. The next one was our budget that would be weighted. The other one would be, and this is an example, it would be case community relations that would be weighted. The one about community relations, I felt that that one could be like a variable because depending on the board parties at that time, that could be somewhat addressed for that superintendent based on those board priorities at that time. So Those are those three Ps. I only broke down the grading piece for the board goals. And when I look at, like, for instance, third grade reading. For third grade reading, you get 15 points. Fifth grade math, you get 15 points. Eighth grade rating is 15 points. Graduation rate is 15 points. Because all of them have disaggregated numbers to them. And then for each disaggregated numbers, you can give a rating of 3 points for each one. So there's basically, if you hit three of them, you meet for that particular section. If you hit 40%, it's a progress. So it shows progress. And then if you don't hit any of them, of course it shows did not meet. And this is one of the reasons why we did this, because I was in the conference around a workshop around this as well, and just want to.

A: Tell everyone, I just emailed what you just sent to me to everybody else. Please don't reply back, but just so everyone can see it on their computers. Thank you. Sorry for the interruption.

start time: 569:26:18.000
end time: 620:21:30.000
confidence: 0.94
H: Oh, yeah, no, no, that's great. That's great. But also, and I want to make sure this is clear, this is not something that we should just be looking at every year. One of the things that I learned in the workshops was this evaluation should be going along with progress monitoring, monthly progress monitoring. So to talk about what Director Melbourne was saying is that we want to be able to dive into more measures to see if our kids are ready to succeed, whether it's cte, bilingual instruction as well. So this can't just be a. This shouldn't just be a standalone doc that we look at once a year and we try to rate. It has to come with some progress monitoring. And with the workshop I was in, they talk about monthly monitoring. And if we are monthly monitoring this stuff, we're one. We're able to see growth because we're monitoring this on a monthly basis. You're able to see, and she can, and the superintendent can explain what measures and implementation she's doing. So we can kind of see what's, what's happening throughout the year. And so at the end of the year and we go to our evaluation, you know, there's, there's things we can say, okay, you know what? We didn't meet here, but we've seen all, you know, all year what you've been trying to do. Then we can come at it in a more of a how do we support. Where do we need to support to fill holes? Where do we need to move to fill holes to be successful? Because at the end of the day, we're looking, trying to look at success for our kids. And so doing that, it puts this evaluation in more of a how do we support and help and fill holes to being successful and then hopefully that can go down through the district. As far as when we do talk about evaluations, that these evaluations are not punitive, they're more up to how do we help you be successful? And we all know at the end of the day, if year after year, superintendent's not meeting, meeting the goals, then we already know what the end results are. Right. We look for another superintendent. Right. So that's what that is. And also, last thing I'll say is with this as well, I think we should maybe look at a two year process as far as our board goes, at least for the board goals section, we can look at a two year process because you want to give time to make course correction and then have time to reevaluate if those work or did work. And then also what worked and how we can scale up what worked as well. And so those are some of the things that I learned at the council great city schools and in with conversations with Superintendent Armstrong. Thanks.

I: Yeah, I appreciate the call in Gary Hollins, Director Hollins. I think what I would say is what's important to me, I think is much of what Julia Burme Edwards opened with, which is being able to have a document that, that is clear to me on how my performance is being measured. I'm in a progress monitor anyway, but knowing what those targets are and what the expectations are, whether they're Borgos, whether they're, you know, some qualitative summary statements that, or at least themes so that I can know what those are, those are extremely important to me. I will say that one of the things that I thought about after sitting in some sessions in council that really appealed to me is the thought of an even, odd year switch, meaning this, you know, my evaluation happening in an odd year this year would be about progress towards board goals. And then in even years it's, you know, did it meet or not? And so, so that really spoke to me because of the way because we're using all lagging indicators and oftentimes we don't have full access or even able to communicate out that data until well into the start of the school year, at least in that first month that if, let's say that I have one year where it was not met, all of our staffing decisions are made, all of the ways in which we've set up our budget has already been made. And maybe there was a glaring opportunity to drill down on something. If I'm in a progress year, then I have the opportunity to align my budget to the priorities, also make changes as needed, add where needed, you know, sunset where needed and then preparing for the next year to say okay, based on all those months moves and all those strategies will we get to met? And so I would say that that really stands out to me and I like the three part that Director Hollins talks about where you know, 60% of the evaluation is on the board goals and the other 40% are themes named by the board based on what's happening. Right. And what's relevant in the work and what you all are seeing is glaring items that need to be tackled. Or maybe it's a collaborative conversation. But I would say that those are my initial thoughts.

A: Sorry, I'm going to let you go in just a sec. But I just want to add one of the advantages of that system to the Director Holland that you point out with the 60% and then the 30%, 10%, I can't remember 20, 20% is then that allows space for like direct Bim Edwards, the things that you pointed out where we can fit things like that in where and then that can also be incorporated into the progress monitoring. So I think that that's, that's kind of where the power of Director Holland's your suggestion is, is that it allows that flexibility where then we can start looking at other measures of, you know, the complete student instead of just, just state test data.

start time: 679:28:30.000

start time: 681:16:06.000
end time: 687:44:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I mean we're like one of the months into the year one of the ideas that we, we had was to use Superintendent Armstrong's 100 day plan as her evaluation for this year. Because one of the problems with evaluation this year is like was mentioned before the data's lag. Right. There's a lag in the data. It means we won't have data for this year until well into next year.

start time: 687:46:00.000
end time: 694:56:34.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I'm sorry but that's nothing that was been discussed by the board and like the 100 day plan hasn't been presented to us nor, I mean that's a board discussion, not a like board leadership gets to decide. And that, that wouldn't be what I would say would be what I would consider a measurement. I mean that is, to me it.

start time: 694:56:42.000
end time: 699:24:40.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Is a board discussion and I misspoke. I meant to say that I was proposing this idea as a two year cycle because I wanted the other people to speak first about the two year cycle first before I delve into this. So I misspoke earlier. But yes, it has to be a board decision.

start time: 700:05:40.000
end time: 704:02:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Well, to me that's the discussion we should be. But most of it is around the template for what's being proposed is for next year.

start time: 704:29:40.000
end time: 711:15:46.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yes. And then I think we need to have discussion if we should be using this for this year as well. And because, and then that's the reason why, you know, what Director Hollins and Superintendent Armstrong mentioned about going with this idea they got from the conference was a two year cycle. And so if we, if we wanted a two year cycle, then we should have that discussion about what we're going to be doing for this year.

start time: 711:16:58.000
end time: 726:00:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: But wouldn't we, it doesn't make any sense to have a two year cycle. But like we're going to do something different the first year. I mean and to me like the 100 day plan, that would have been like something we decided in July, not after the 100 days. So to me it seems like makes way more sense is we agree on a template and if we want to evaluate it in terms of measurement of progress at the end of this year in a different way than we would after like a full year in which the superintendent had, you know, it's her team, it's her budget, everything else. But I don't see why we would like make up, spend, say we're going to have a two year cycle but they're going to actually be two different evaluations. It doesn't make any sense to me because then it's not a two year cycle, it's just two one year cycles.

start time: 726:03:10.000
end time: 732:58:30.000
confidence: 0.98
I: Yeah, but I wonder if just an easy fix to that is that this evaluation template still holds and instead of the Met, because we won't have the data until the next academic year, it's the progress I'm reporting on the progress that we're making towards meeting the goals in the next year and then evaluated on the goals next year, I think is what I was.

start time: 733:00:30.000
end time: 733:28:22.000
confidence: 0.99
B: I think that makes a lot more.

start time: 733:30:06.000
end time: 739:48:50.000
confidence: 0.91
F: Sense because when we had this conversation with us over tenant, we agreed to move the evaluation to November so that we had the data. I assumed we were operating off the same timeline. Again, not just a question of one year or two year. We can have that conversation. But no matter what, typically we move forward with the evaluation. Would Take place in November after the data is available.

start time: 740:43:10.000
end time: 748:00:32.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I think that's also in the timelines of what. So I think there's two sets of considerations. One, sometimes we make compensation adjustments based on the evaluation. Also, what are the timelines that are laid out actually in the contract which.

start time: 748:00:56.000
end time: 749:19:40.000
confidence: 0.95
F: I figured like 90 day or 60 day, I can't remember. But not time of year, I don't believe.

start time: 750:10:32.000
end time: 753:20:48.000
confidence: 0.91
F: The data with Superintendent Guerrero and so we had made this decision to move it. I assume we were still doing that. Does anyone object to continue to do the evaluation November?

start time: 753:23:44.000
end time: 765:39:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I will just say there's a couple things to think about. So first of all, if the data is not being considered for the first year anyway, like do you just get on, do you just do it at the end of the year? I also would say just keep in mind we ran into this once before, as people may recall of the board, that is with the superintendent for the year, evaluating the superintendent versus individuals who are branches brand new to the board, evaluating the superintendent for performance, which they weren't even there for.

start time: 766:20:50.000
end time: 766:56:10.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Which would happen this year or next year.

start time: 766:56:50.000
end time: 772:14:50.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Actually it could, yeah, it could happen like on odd year the year that we have board cycles. And you know, it's not, I mean there's, there's probably ways to work it around it all boards do that. But I'm just saying it was, you may recall it was a issue when we had a change in the last board.

start time: 772:30:30.000
end time: 782:29:40.000
confidence: 0.97
I: So I'm open to whatever obviously you all lay out. I guess I just, my question would be what would it be for the 24, 25 school year? And then again I just want to uplift and highlight what director Green Green said about the high expectations and the numbers. Those don't scare me. I think just having a clear document and understanding of what those expectations are and when I can expect those conversations so that I'm prepared is the only hope that I have in this process.

end time: 789:24:50.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Okay, so I want to respond. I don't even, I don't have an issue. Issue with the evaluation in November. I thought that's what we were doing anyway. So for me that was, that was solid. My question was going to be. But I, I knew it was, it was rhetorical. It was going to be how many days are left in the 100 day plan? And I know that it's already over.

start time: 789:26:50.000
end time: 790:11:14.000
confidence: 0.84
B: No, actually it's 100 days of school plan.

start time: 790:12:42.000
end time: 806:01:00.000
confidence: 0.96
G: 100 days of school. So then great. Then even better because my, then it leads to what role did the board play? In setting. Since Chair Wong is suggesting that we use that as the, as the thing that we go by, my question then becomes, what role did the board play in setting what we want to see within that hundred days? And if you're using the old, the old, the old goals chart at all. Because again, in my mind, until we have something new in place, the old is what, is what we have. And so the old template, regardless of whether we like it or love it, hate it or we're indifferent about it, until we have something new in place, that old one is what we have. So we would be going on the old one until we get a new one and the board approves something new.

start time: 806:02:30.000
end time: 806:05:52.000
confidence: 0.51
A: Right.

start time: 806:06:16.000
end time: 829:17:40.000
confidence: 0.97
G: I mean, this is just the way the law works. You know, the, this is the way the board thing works. So until we get something new in place, then the old is all we have. So I would be holding you accountable to whether you like it or not. You know, you may not approve of it or any of those things, but until we do something different is what we have. And that's what you would be, you would be judged on. Unless we as a board come together and decide, okay, we, we did want to come consider the 100 day plan, but we want to see what it is and we want to have input on what it's supposed to be and what we want that, that outcome to be. Because we're supposed to be the ones. I keep saying this. We're supposed to be the ones directing the traffic. We say as the board, we say where we want to go. And then her job is to figure out how she's going to use her team to get us where we said we wanted to be at. Now, whether or not she goes down Lombard or goes down Columbia or if she takes Marine Drive, I don't care how she gets there. I'm not telling her that. I think that's too far into the weeds. But it is my job to say, show up at Fred Meyers at 11:00 and you need to be there at 11:00. And that's, that's sort of what I'm. So if we're going to use the Hundred Day, then I think we need to, we need to have some input on it. Otherwise we're using the other one.

I: So just really quickly. So if you remember, in my very first meetings with you all, I asked a series of questions on things that you all hope to see in this first year. I also asked the same questions to each of the executive leaders. I met with over 60 principals. I also met with community members and some educators asking those same questions. And so there were three things that are actually reflected in you all. And so you've probably seen them because I report on them every time I get to do my superintendent's report at the board meetings. The very first one is lifting Literacy. That seemed to be a very strong theme amongst you all, especially you, Director Green. And so even your words about it being a community effort, which is why lifting literacy is also about a campaign where we're across the city with it. The second was trust in relationships. I heard over and over again we need to heal, we need to repair, we need to build strong relationships. We want people to trust us, we want people to know us. So that's number two. And the third, I think is been reflected in things that I've heard from Director Brim Edwards, I've heard from Director Scott about our facilities, not just our infrastructure, but also safety. Clean, dry when they need to be dry, warm when they need to be warm, and cool when they need to be cool. So priority three is about safe and supported classrooms. So Those are the three 100 days of school plan that's set to end about late January, early February. And then it was going to be a report out which was really is what has been guiding my work this year with the team and out in community with our community transition team and what I report on once a month.

D: I want to take a moment to talk. So I'm from a big family. I usually don't have to ask. I think it would be unfair to evaluate a superintendent based on an old someone else's budget, someone else's team members. I do like the idea of using that 100 day plan, if for nothing else except that it's what you've heard we need to focus on and it's not those hard board goals. But we have a brand new leader in the district that you're familiar with. And I think it's really important to listen to for us and for Dr. Armstrong to listen to what's been said about what this community and what this district needs and we need to trust that if it came up strongly enough in the data, this is not based on one person talking. This is based on a series of interviews with 60 principals, et cetera, community members. I think that we need to take that into account. That's why we're here. I don't know if you talk to any students or not, but anyway, I think that that's what we need. And year one, we need to support the superintendent in establishing a foundation and then once those things are taken or addressed, then we can start to look at. And I really like Director Holland's suggestion by the way of I love this, the point system and the every other year. I also like the scoring rubric and so on.

I: Can I just jump in and say that I did not have the chance to meet with students in the beginning because the data collection that I was doing as I was setting up for the 100 days of school plan was in July and some parts of August and so school hadn't started. And I'll also say though that I did sit with a couple of the search consultants who ran the community groups and was sharing what they heard from not only community, but also what they heard from student groups. And so that's reflected in there as well. And of course some of the data points that I heard through the interview process.

B: So I think a hundred day plan is not multi dimensional enough. We hired the superintendent for more than 100 days this school year. I think there's ways, ways to take the template again. If we're going to have a two year thing, it needs to be the same thing. The two. I mean it's not a two year thing if it's two different things. Let's just be clear, that's one year thing. And I think there's ways in which to definitely incorporate. I'm looking at the competencies that we were looking for, which to me, like it seemed like the last meeting, that is where we land. Like everybody nodded like, yes, the competency reset. So we have those laid out. I could look at this and say experience, strategic and visionary educational leadership and authentic and inclusive leadership. Those would be like the 100 day plan would fit into that. I'm also looking at some of these other competencies because I certainly don't expect after the first hundred days of school, like we have a really hard budget year coming up. We have a very important legislative session. We have our facilities get over the finish line and those aren't going to be in the first hundred days. So I would be like, yes, and like, great. That's a great foundation to knock the 100 day plan out of the park. But I also think we hired a superintendent for the whole year and I think with a set of competencies and skills that we expect and some definite results that we're expecting, and I think we should have an evaluation that reflects that. Again, I already shared what my feelings are on the using the data in the first year because that's one thing. It sounds like you guys weren't talking about even using it in the first year anyway. But I do think using the competencies that are more, more multifaceted about the things that, I mean, PPS is big and complicated and it. This is like setting high expectations and we've got some big stuff at the end of the year that have nothing to do with, you know, maybe some of the things in the 100 day plan that need to happen. And we need the leadership from the superintendent.

C: One thing I'd like to see added to whatever evaluation we do, and this came up also at the conference, is to on a monthly basis be looking at what's happening with the data and see what adjustments are made. I know you heard the same thing at our meeting, Superintendent. And so that we're keeping on track on a monthly basis of what's happening. And I don't know what kind of data is coming out of individual classrooms that we can use, but it seems like something we could really discuss and I'm sure your team is working on that all the time and just find out what they're doing and what's happening. I think that's really important that the board hears on a very regular basis. And if you could keep, you know, if you would be able to give us the material we need for that so that we can talk about it every month, that would be something for me that would be an important evaluation.

H: Yes, thank you. I agree with Director Sullivan as well. As far as the monthly progress monitoring piece, as I was hearing everybody and just kind of listening to some of the comments, I agree with. Oh bless somebody that using the piece that I sent out, we can actually use that for year one and, and for the cumulation of year two, and we can put in those different things that we want to measure for this year as well. Knowing that by, in November and I'm, I'm with Director Scott, I thought we were looking to do this in November. So this, this template I put together was for like year one, which will culminate in November of 2025, and then year two would culminate in year year 2026, November. Once the numbers came out, that first year would be more of a progress year to see where we're at based on our board goals and also being able to implement or incorporate some of the stuff that Director Bertram Edwards was talking about as far as whether the stuff that we want to look at for this year, I think it can fall in one of those two categories when we talk about, you know, the board goals, the budget, and then that third category could be some of those other things that Director was looking at for year one. So just my, my thoughts from hearing that and the 100 day ghost stuff, I'm gonna be honest, I didn't know that was something that we were talking about as far as evaluations. So I don't, that's just something that I'm not really. I don't know how I feel about that one if I'm using the 100 day goal stuff.

A: Yeah, Director, the 100 day idea was just something I threw out today. So it's not, it wasn't something that we were talking about. It's just an idea to throw on the table, be like, you know, what can we do on the first year as interim as we're prepping for the second year for this two year cycle idea that you had. But again, you know, that's why I kind of threw it out for discussion. It's more just kind of to throw ideas out to prompt discussion.

start time: 1003:24:38.000

B: I'm concerned that the conversations to date and that we're moving towards approving an evaluation at the next meeting that's not even for this year. Like, we're missing the boat as a.

I: Board.

end time: 1035:01:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: To be setting the evaluation template for this year, which is one of the job responsibilities of the board. So, you know, next meeting, approving an evaluation template for next year without having something in place for this year, it seems like a big miss. I think there's ways that the template can be used for this year. And I would, I mean, I will just say I think it's really unfair to superintendent to continue to change the template. I can see like, hey, we're fine tuning it, but to have it just dramatically change and a lot of staff time spent on like, do we know what we're pointing at? So it seems like instead of saying, hey, next year we're going to point at this. And in the meantime, we're going to have a discussion about what we're focusing on this year. I don't, I don't think is stabilizing. So as much as possible, I think we should try. And whatever we think is there's an agreement on for next year, like how do we modify that in a, maybe an abbreviated format that works for the superintendent for this first year so it's not like, and now we're going to spend four months recreating it next year?

start time: 1035:39:50.000
end time: 1044:51:02.000
confidence: 0.95
I: I mean, is that just as simple as just having an asterisk where the data will be collected on progress towards the goals and interim assessments? I mean, the template, whichever is final, if you're going to do the parts, as Director Hollins have said, or wherever you all land. But I feel like that could still be this year. Instead of using last year's data, it will be more narrative of other data sources collected that is still connected to the board goals.

start time: 1044:53:26.000
end time: 1057:46:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So to me that seems very plausible. And I like the idea of like, okay, we're four or five months into this year, but like, here's the progress that we're making or here are the things that we have in place for that and sharing the date, like with the baseline data. It is what it is. And when I look at the competency categories, I definitely think it allows for the things that I think you have had envisioned and talked about in your 100 day plan and the other things that need to happen just in sort of being the sort of operational lead of the district. And to me, I don't see that a lot more work would have to be done.

start time: 1057:48:40.000
end time: 1070:54:10.000
confidence: 0.96
I: I agree with you because it sounds like we're at agreement. I think the only thing that seems to still be a little loose, at least from my understanding, and maybe there's board understanding, but the idea about 60% of the weight of the evaluation, where 60% of it is around the board goals and then the other 20 or 30 or whatever it is that. Yep. Or even if there's some competencies or things that you want to pull out or other areas to be developed in a, you know, annual meeting on priorities or something like that. But I love the idea of it being weighted with some emphasis and importance on some of our other areas that really need to be lifted.

start time: 1071:15:50.000
end time: 1091:39:20.000
confidence: 0.88
B: I think we had it. Was it double weighted less last time and then was it double wave and then the third, then not there were leadership standards, but competencies. So from my perspective, I think that's, I'd be okay with that. Moving it to that again, I, I think there's, especially in this first year because this is what I'm focusing on, like we need an evaluation this year is like measuring some of those other competencies, especially in the first year is measurements of success versus the data and then setting whatever the. For the 24, 24, 25 school year, the 25, 26 for next year, setting a, like a weighting in there that could be negotiated, but I don't see in this first year that we're going to do that.

start time: 1091:59:00.000
end time: 1094:45:40.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Does that get to your timing issue though about establishing a template where board members that have worked for the year with the superintendent.

start time: 1095:19:20.000
end time: 1105:16:42.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Okay, I'm focused on this year and I haven't heard anybody say that there's going to be numerical weighting on the data. Maybe you did for the results in next year, the year over year, the school year we're currently in. Is anybody saying that they're going to be using, be using that weighted data?

start time: 1105:19:46.000
end time: 1132:02:50.000
confidence: 0.94
F: You're talking about the student achievement data? Oh, I mean that's what I would do. I would, yeah, I mean I would simplify this. I would take the template we have. I would use it for 24, 25 and 2526 because I think we've set our goals and the other things that we wouldn't evaluate until November of 2025. So we have the data. But again, this is for me, it gets back to what I said at the very beginning. I would not. I don't like the idea of a mathematical formula. You know, three points for this, five points for that. For me it's much more of a, you know, we as a board are looking at the results and then you know, off the other factors that go into it. Maybe I'll just take this moment to respond because I really appreciated Director Green's you know, comments about setting a high bar. I think that's really important. And you know, I just wanted to be clear when I talk about not using a mathematical formula, it goes both ways. It's not that I'm going to celebrate 1%, although I do think if you're at 1%, everyone else is at minus 10. You've still done something right, still want to have more achievement. But it goes the other direction as well. If we achieve. I think I said this before, but if we go up by 5%, the beverage goes up by 10% because they found this magic way of educating their black and brown students. And our superintendent and district are like, eh, we don't really want to do that. Well, I think that's an opportunity to go back and say, you know, you were not successful, you might have gone by 5%, you weren't successful. So for me, it goes, it goes both ways, which is why I don't think the board should lock itself into a mathematical formula. But we should. I would just use the same template for both years.

start time: 1132:38:30.000
end time: 1143:57:46.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah. And one advantage, and what I like about the tier cycle is that then you're not switching goals halfway through. Right. It would be unfair for. I mean, I like the idea of using this template this year from November till next year. November. And this is the progress cycle or progress tracking cycle. Right. Because the new board's going to be coming on by then too, and they're part of the progress tracking cycle too. And then the following year would be the evaluation year, using the same template. Because otherwise it would be unfair to be like, hey, we use this template for this year. But then now that you already set your budget, now that you already set your goals, now that you already set your staffing, we're going to change the goals on you. Right. And that would be more than unfair.

F: So.

start time: 1144:01:38.000
end time: 1149:34:30.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So I think I just want to reiterate, keep it simple. I would like to just have this template, I would also like Director Hollins ideas incorporated into it as well and do that. And it's a two year cycle and we keep the same thing for two years. We can still evaluate, we can still do the progress tracking to these goals.

start time: 1150:08:10.000
end time: 1152:13:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I'm sorry, are you saying we don't evaluate every year or we're going to use the same template for the two years?

start time: 1152:29:00.000
end time: 1152:39:00.000
confidence: 0.71
A: Both.

start time: 1152:41:00.000
end time: 1165:01:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Well, because it's the board's job to evaluate the superintendent every year. I mean, that's one of our key lanes that we're supposed to be in. So I'm, I just want to make sure that we're all clear what it was, but what it is they're doing. Because like, I expect at the end of this year we have an evaluation superintendent. Because it actually should be a tool that helps the superintendent in terms of like, yes, keep doing that, like double down on that, or here's a place where we think, like more development needs to happen or that we're concerned that, you know, progress isn't made, but that should happen every year. That doesn't happen every other year.

start time: 1165:49:20.000
end time: 1183:41:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I think we're just mixing up on terminology because for me, a progress report is still an evaluation. But the advantage, and I'm just reiterating what I heard from Director Hollins and Dr. Armstrong, is that a two year cycle is more of fair assessment. Because if we decide to, let's say the board decides to change its goals, right? This year's budgets has already been set, right? The appropriation of resources has already been set for this year. So judging the new goals on that year would be unfair. And part of the reason for a two year cycle is that, okay, we established the goals, now if this year's budget's already set, well, we got, well, this is the year you work on it and we should start seeing the results the following year. And that's the part of it. So I don't think we're not evaluating. I think we're consistently evaluating. In fact, if we go by what was said at the conference, we're evaluating it every month, little check ins here and there.

start time: 1183:49:20.000
end time: 1194:39:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: But I don't, but the reality is that's not happening and it hasn't happened so far with our new superintendent. And so, I mean, it's like it's a theoretical discussion. It's not happening. I mean, I feel like in fairness, always here's the expectation of like what we're expecting for the year and we'd agreed upon, the superintendent and the board have agreed upon it and then you're doing check ins. But we again haven't had that discussion. So I don't feel, feel like that is happening.

start time: 1194:54:50.000
end time: 1211:53:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: If I may, if I may, I think I possibly see a path forward. Possibly. Let me try a little all over the place if I'm gonna be honest, Be honest. What if we, what if the board adopted this template with some of Director Holland's ideas about how you monitor, measure the goals for this first year. I'm just making this month up because I don't know what Dr. Armstrong's contract looks like in March. Dr. Armstrong could provide a self reflection on the board goals and the progress to the board goals and on the competencies. The board could respond to that in terms of an evaluative aspect. And then you don't have to have a November cycle because then you can go to the next March. I'm just making that up. And you would then have all the lagging data that you would need to look at actual board goal progress.

I: We do. I appreciate it. I. And I like it. I just, I mean, I think. I don't know if there's still discussion between November or March or what that needs to be for me, November or March. That it doesn't make too big of a difference because anything that comes out of the OSAS data that we're going to be planning for through that budget cycle that goes through that winter through March. So I mean, it's. If there's going to be some major moves or changes, it's not going to be in November. It's going to be communicated out in March on how we're adjusting and resetting. So. So I'm open.

There was an abbreviated year and then the same template moving forward. And something to think about for. Not this year, but at a certain point there is. It's good to get it synced up with potential board cycle changes so that it's messy when you have it not aligned with the people evaluating you aren't the people who. Rogueless.

Even though we know between now and March we won't be measuring the board goals, the superintendent will produce a self reflection that talks about progress that she and us have made towards meeting and putting things in place to meet the board goals. So an evaluation will happen at some.

E: Let's just call it. I don't know when the board would decide if they would want to do that, but at some point in March or after. So we know, we have all. We know that in future years, we have all the data that we need by that point in time. And then next cycle into the next year, we would use the template. We would be able to rate the.

start time: 1309:04:52.000

confidence: 0.96
F: Board will be able to rate the.

start time: 1309:20:52.000

confidence: 0.93
E: Board goals and also rate the competencies moving forward.

I: So I would love for us to. I know this comes back to you all in a public meeting, so I'd love to do like even a draft calendar. I feel like I need to nail those days down. That's going to make me a little anxious there, not knowing what, when and where. So if that's fine, could we draft.

start time: 1316:52:38.000
end time: 1318:30:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Something then to share with everybody? Are you suggesting that you draft something?

start time: 1318:48:30.000
end time: 1326:01:40.000
confidence: 0.95
I: I was going to connect with Roseanne and look at the calendar of meetings and sort of the flow of things and see if we can at least take a first draft to present to you all. And then if there's edits, maybe Roseanne can share it out and see if there's any strong reactions. And if not, then it'll just be prepped with the final evaluation for consideration.

start time: 1327:10:00.000
end time: 1332:35:52.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So one small thing, one of the competencies, just the way it got just directly pulled from the document, the document itself, it just. I don't think we want to have this in evaluation. It talks about like, what the background is. It's like that's just a fact. Not actually something we measure.

start time: 1332:36:56.000
end time: 1332:50:48.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Which one is that?

start time: 1332:51:44.000
end time: 1334:16:56.000
confidence: 0.82
B: It's the experience, strategic and visionary education, leadership. And then just says a robust background in KTalk.

start time: 1334:17:28.000
end time: 1334:28:56.000
confidence: 0.76
E: I see.

start time: 1334:31:28.000
end time: 1337:18:06.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I mean I think that's the only one. I looked at the rest of them and they all seem like they will be applicable to the work now versus like some credential that you brought with you.

start time: 1337:18:48.000
end time: 1337:32:30.000
confidence: 0.82
A: You sure?

start time: 1339:48:10.000
end time: 1340:01:06.000
confidence: 0.68
B: Okay.

start time: 1340:02:58.000
end time: 1343:21:06.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Any other ideas, thoughts, questions? We found a good landing place. Yeah, we got one. Do you have enough from us to.

start time: 1343:22:18.000
end time: 1343:45:06.000
confidence: 0.93
E: I believe so, yes.

start time: 1343:48:18.000
end time: 1344:12:50.000
confidence: 1.00
A: We don't need anything else.

start time: 1344:15:30.000
end time: 1359:11:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So one thing, this is like just less about us. But it would be useful for me to understand just like I think the superintendent's face. Like I'm trying to understand what it is that you all are looking for me this year on page 11. It's like the board of directors feedback, you know, just like you like to meet expectations to understand what it is from your perspective, even at a high level, what that would look like. Like what does success look like for the board to you? You don't have to answer right now. It's just like you could. No, it just be. It would be helpful because like thinking about it just like you're like, okay, what are they expecting of me? So like the same thing with us. Like I want to get a good grade on this from the superintendent. Like what does that look like?

start time: 1359:43:40.000
end time: 1362:41:20.000
confidence: 0.94
D: This is also. I know Director Sullivan is working on a board self evaluation. So perhaps that could consider those questions on page 11.

start time: 1362:55:40.000
end time: 1365:11:32.000
confidence: 0.90
B: But I want to know how the superintendent views like how we could. How we are supporting her to be successful.

start time: 1365:13:56.000
end time: 1365:32:20.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Yeah. Is that part of the.

start time: 1365:34:20.000
end time: 1367:00:10.000
confidence: 0.86
C: That's part of it. Isn't that part of the. So it's here, isn't it?

start time: 1367:11:50.000
end time: 1367:21:18.000
confidence: 0.44
D: Yeah.

start time: 1367:22:54.000
end time: 1374:52:40.000
confidence: 0.93
E: It sounds like to me that at these monthly meetings you might have two questions you might ask the superintendent, so how are things going? What are you doing? And then you might ask how can we support you? And that would allow you to receive ongoing feedback around that. So there are hopefully no surprises when the superintendent participated introduces herself. Reflection and evaluation. How does that sound? That sounds great.

start time: 1374:53:20.000
end time: 1375:14:32.000
confidence: 0.99
I: And I have check ins with all.

start time: 1375:14:56.000
end time: 1376:19:00.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Of you within the next couple weeks. So I will add that to each of them.

start time: 1377:06:40.000
end time: 1382:19:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Great. Make sure that's in writing so no one forgets you asked exactly what I was going to say. So thank you. Any other comments, thoughts? Director Hollins? Just want to check in with you, make sure you do okay on that side of the world.

start time: 1382:36:10.000

H: No, I'm good.

start time: 1383:36:10.000
end time: 1388:42:00.000
confidence: 0.93
B: So if we're going to vote on this at next meetings, can we get the draft calendar in advance so that we can provide feedback versus and then here's how we should. Here's how we should be providing feedback. Feedback on anything so that we actually can get it over the finish line.

start time: 1389:15:00.000
end time: 1391:15:40.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Yeah. In case you missed that, direct sub director Ben Edwards asked if we could get the calendar ahead of time to make sure that we're okay with it.

start time: 1391:16:20.000
end time: 1393:34:00.000
confidence: 0.98
