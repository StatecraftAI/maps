A: Are we ready to start? Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Board of Education Policy Committee meeting. This meeting is scheduled to last to 5:45. Just to do a brief overview of the agenda. We're going to start with introductions, then public comment and then we're going to have a extensive discussion on the or take a little bit deeper on the student cell phone use policy and have a discussion somewhat about short discussion about our engagement. Director Wong has a cell phone resolution, a draft cell phone resolution that we're going to have a discussion about and Also House Bill 2753 which relates to the Board of Education stipends. And then we also. I'm just going to dispense this right now. The last item on the agenda are policies referred for first readings, both the field trip, foreign travel and other office campus activities and the promotion and retention of students. Unless we have public comment at the beginning, those at the last meeting we referred them out for for a first reading which actually hasn't happened yet. So there's nothing that's happened since the last meeting. So I apologize for anybody who came for that item. But there's not. We're going to have the first reading at the August 6th meeting. We'll have 21 days for public comment and then we'll have a scheduled second reading or make adjustments based on public comment. So with that I'm just going to start with introductions and just start, I guess just the dais or one off the dais. Kara, do you want to just start? Yes. Kara Bradshaw, executive assistant.

A: Great. Thanks everybody for coming today. We're going to start with public comment and I'm just going to say we have five slots open. We have just one person signed up. So if somebody came, if they wanted to provide comment on the two policies that we are going to get first read you can between now the time the one person who signed up finishes, if you want to let us know that you want to speak, we can open up a two minute slot. So go ahead, Kara, if you want to. Yes, we have Kyra Casperi, call the person forward again. Yeah, Kyra Casperi, do you hear? Kyra. Okay, does anybody else want to take a two minutes slot before we move into the meeting? Roseanne. Okay, we're going to just jump into the first topic and I'm going to a lot about 50 to 55 minutes for this discussion so we can get through the other items and also Director Wong's resolution. So with that we thought we would do today is we have a draft that staff offered as sort of a starting point or strawman and we have had comments that were offered to and these are all posted that were offered by Director Wong and also comments from our previous student rep, Frankie Solar Sign. And I will say I think the, the best thing to do is for us when we go through this to like section by section is to use the version that has Director Wong's comments on it and then I will bring in Frankie Silverstein the format ref's comments. And so if you want to follow along the version we'd be using the way you can tell it's the right version is in at the very end it has a C in italics that says the district shall provide the necessary support and resources for the schools to implement this policy. That's the one we're going to work off of. Does that work? I think as a frame up I'm going to ask Liz or Mary for you to just walk through section by section and see if there are maybe offer any sort of context or nuance that you want to add. And I think what we'll use this time to do is like gather questions if people have concerns about a provision.

start time: 97:18:10.000
end time: 105:23:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So we in some of our planning discussions had instructional leaders here and I'm wondering do you want to introduce. This is at your discretion, Julia. So it's not my preference if you would like them up here now it might be a time to walk through section by section with them. I think they're here to answer questions and talk about implementation hurdles. Shall we invite them up here?

start time: 105:32:30.000
end time: 114:02:58.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Okay, so come on up and come on up, introduce yourself. I so would like you to like at least kick off like here's what our thinking was. If you modified it all from the LA policy and then we'll go to the panel and then board members because this is a committee meeting, not a formal board meeting. It's much more discussion style so we have a much more less formal style. So.

start time: 114:03:24.000
end time: 121:04:38.000
confidence: 0.92
C: So Julia, we'd be happy to walk through section by section. I don't have the redline version where we were modifying the draft just to recall for everyone watching this was a strawman discussion draft. This is now. We're now working off the one that's in board books that was with some additional modifications from Director Wong. But the bulk of this is from the LUSD policy massaged I would say.

A: I didn't say that. Thank you for all taking the time this afternoon to be here. We really appreciate and we're going to be very interested in your school based perspective, district based perspective of.

start time: 144:43:30.000
end time: 161:01:32.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So the general guidelines are that students may have phones, but the expectation is that they will be turned off during the school day. We kept the language, as you can see, we kept it rather broad, allowing for a number of options depending on the school. I know that some schools currently are using yonder, but that's just one of a number of ways in which schools can prohibit cell phones and other like devices during normal school hours. So we didn't want to, we didn't want to put a specific type of implementation of how to keep the phones away because we don't know what our financials will be and we want to offer schools some options. Do you want to stop there and just.

start time: 161:04:36.000
end time: 171:22:16.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Or what would you like to stop there? It's not a very long policy, so I think we can do with that. So I'm going to jump in and maybe just like model how we can do the discussion. So I'm curious both from our school based leaders, but also just from the legal support standpoint, have we covered all ways in which students might access the Internet or social media? We don't have watches here, but is that, does the definition cover everything? And again, I know how creative students.

start time: 171:23:28.000
end time: 171:33:40.000
confidence: 1.00
D: Are.

end time: 176:02:50.000
confidence: 0.94
C: To the extent they have Chromebooks, they have access to the Internet. So for these kinds of devices we tried to be as cell phones or similar devices and the electronic signaling. But there are lots of ways to access the Internet in a school.

start time: 176:39:50.000
end time: 184:28:06.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I think when it comes down to it, and we've talked about this previously, the technology moves so quickly that to put something very specific into the policy might not serve us that we're better off with school based rules. Right. So for this year, you know, once, I don't know what the newest thing is going to be next year, you know, but allowing the schools to be able to set those parameters made sense to us.

start time: 184:30:38.000
end time: 188:00:10.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Can I have a question about so in the library or media room though, what about for research purposes? Would that be, would that be allowable use in the library?

start time: 188:15:10.000
end time: 191:09:58.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Well, I believe that every student has a Chromebook in the district. They will be able to use that for research purposes. They wouldn't need a cell phone to do the research because of their Chromebook.

start time: 191:12:54.000
end time: 195:09:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I think it's helpful to think about two different pockets. One is access to social media and one is access to devices, personal devices. And there's not a full overlap of those things if that helps.

start time: 195:23:10.000
end time: 197:40:00.000
confidence: 0.93
H: Would it be helpful to include like the devices with cameras for example? Now we got smart glasses going on.

start time: 197:40:40.000
end time: 197:43:12.000
confidence: 0.73
E: Right.

start time: 197:43:36.000
end time: 202:13:40.000
confidence: 0.92
H: And some smart watches can take pictures. Because one of the issues that arise in schools is that students are taking photos and using it on social media or bullying. An extreme example. Right. And so I feel like would it be helpful to have a mention of cameras?

start time: 202:22:00.000
end time: 209:24:50.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I think if we going back to my original idea is keeping it as high level as possible and then allowing as each new development like this year is the cameras on the glasses. Next year is going to be. I don't know what it will be, but it will be something. And so to have more general language which we have, we talk about photos.

start time: 209:46:30.000
end time: 213:32:48.000
confidence: 0.87
A: So in 1C, for example, would it be are similar devices or similar devices or devices with similar capabilities? Because it's the cap in that one. It's like the capability versus the device.

start time: 213:34:24.000
end time: 220:02:04.000
confidence: 0.97
C: And it might be helpful for our school leader when we talk about the problems the policy is trying to address. So we've now surfaced one is distraction in the classroom. What's the ability for students to focus which is that you must put your phone in a pouch solves that problem. It's not with you again, we can get to other classes or watches. So one issue is focus in the classroom. Another is access to social media. Another is photo taking.

start time: 220:03:32.000
end time: 220:07:40.000
confidence: 0.78
A: Right.

start time: 220:08:20.000
end time: 225:26:00.000
confidence: 0.96
C: And so I think by identifying the biggest challenges for the school and try to match the policy to the problem trying to be solved. And I'm sure there are others. I'm just repeating what I've heard. You all are the experts about what you would like help solving in the schools and what would be helpful or not. So maybe we could talk to that.

start time: 225:37:40.000
end time: 265:55:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: So it's at Grant High School. I speak for Grant is twofold. One is to create greater engagement, student engagements, engagement with teachers, their instruction and each other. And then the second part is addressing problematic behaviors. I think you just mentioned Director Wang Just mentioned one of them, which is, you know, the overwhelming majority of bullying takes place now via a smartphone. And so, you know, we have situations where, you know, student A is just going from one class to another class and a student will snap a picture of them and post it, talking about what they're wearing and those type of things. I'll also add, you know, at Grant High School, with the policy we're going to be moving forward with next year, we're still working on it to perfect it. We've been very clear with students, parents and teachers that smart watches will be included as well. And you're correct, technology is moving swiftly. And as we learn of the newest technologies that we believe will be problematic, we'll add those as well. Really the goal here is to create greater engagement, you know, for our students in the classroom, but also outside the classroom as well, and to address those problematic behaviors that we're seeing on a day to day basis. You know, we, you know, in 2024, when principals arrive in schools, we're dealing with behavior issues that happen on a Saturday night amongst our students. And typically it is through either a cell phone, smartphone or a computer. And so those are things that we're addressing every single day of the week. And so our goal here is to eliminate that issue, but also, just as importantly, stronger engagement amongst our students again with their teachers, with their instruction, and with one another.

start time: 266:28:20.000
end time: 266:58:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: What about the middle school level?

start time: 267:27:00.000
end time: 291:58:21.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Well, we have some of the same problems, some of the same issues, some of the same challenges. And we selected the pouch option because the devices are very expensive and we do not want teachers to be responsible for either keeping them or on their desk or in their closet because they are very, very expensive. I'll give you a scenario. In the past, many years ago, a teacher said, let me have your cell phone. Set it on the desk into the class. The cell phone wasn't there. So with this pouch, the students are able to keep their items with them. No one else is engaging with their item and they're responsible for it, but they just can't use it. We do have students also having those challenging behaviors in between classes. They may go to the bathroom, text, send messages about something like, I'm going to fight someone after school. And so the way some of the apps work, students have all of their friends or their grade level or just anybody they know on their app, like Snapchat, and they'll send a message that says, this is going to happen at 3 o'clock over by the cafeteria. And because we're not on their list of friends, we won't necessarily see that. And the only way we might find out about it is if a concerned student comes and tells us, hey, something is going to happen.

start time: 292:01:25.000
end time: 292:06:27.000
confidence: 0.77
A: So.

start time: 292:06:53.000
end time: 317:07:50.000
confidence: 0.95
G: So we're fortunate when that happens, but it doesn't always happen. So we could talk about the issues all day, but without the cell phone. We do believe students will develop their skills more around communication. During the pandemic, students didn't talk to each other. When they came back to school that first year, they didn't talk to the teacher. They were very quiet. They all wore their masks, so they weren't communicating. And so I personally, and I'm sure you agree, believe that some students are behind developmentally in the skill of communication. So that engagement with the teacher, their curriculum, being able to discuss their ideas, being able to discuss with their peers, the curriculum, or any other social emotional issue is better done in person and through, through the devices. And I will say that sometimes the message you send impacts a person in a way that you didn't intend for it to impact them. Right? Just like with the email. If you send an email, what you thought you were saying was not what that person received. And then with students, because especially in middle school, the frontal lobe is not developed. So what they think, he said they're ready to take action, but they didn't really understand what he said. So the ability to be able to talk face to face, communicate, you know, talk with the counselors or whoever they need to, will be optimal.

start time: 317:10:30.000
end time: 348:51:50.000
confidence: 0.95
E: And also, if you don't mind me asking, what you're hearing right now is our lived experience as administrators. But over the last few years, there's been some really rich peer review research on the dangers of social media platforms and smartphones on our students, particularly our teen girls. And so this goes beyond just what we're seeing and what we're experiencing in our schools. It also is the research that, you know, we've been reading. The other piece I also wanted to include is, you know, next year at Grant High School, our expected enrollment is over 2,200 students. And we chose Yonder because I was concerned about how can we scale up. And with the Yonder pouches, the students will have those when they arrive at school. And it's a way for us to actually implemented for 2200 students. They're just, you know, we looked at some other ways of being able to do this, going cell phone free for our students during the school day. But it was difficult in finding those ways that we could scale it up. And this Was not something that I, speaking for myself, just said, you know, in May, this is what we're going to do. We've been looking at this. I've been thinking about this for quite a while, going all the way back to my days as a VP at Lincoln High School, because it's not a new issue. We're just seeing these issues, particularly after the pandemic increase. So it's been going on for a while. I think the research is catching up as well.

confidence: 0.96
A: I'm sure my personal experience as a parent aligns with a lot of that research. My kids were going through middle school and high school about the time that everybody started getting cell phones. Thanks for the input. I have just a question about the language. Is an electronic signaling device that sounds so, like, archaic, or is that like the term of art for anything that, like social media data could be transmitted?

start time: 357:55:50.000
end time: 360:16:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: We can look at other terms. We took that from some sample policies. Again, this was a starting point for discussion and we blended some concepts.

confidence: 0.93
A: That's just a question I would have on that section. Yeah, go ahead. No, go ahead.

confidence: 0.93
H: Yeah, just I want to follow up on, on your comments because I think it's very important to hear from your lived experiences. So my question is that because we talked on the phone before about how Grant has tried no cell phone policies before, right? And that's kind of what pushed the move to the yonder pouches, right? And so one of the issues that we're facing as a district is now if we want to scale it up, right? And right now, your schools are kind of the first ones to adopt the pouches, and we'll see how that goes. Right now we're looking at this policy and we're trying to have something for the rest of the district. And my question for you is, like, I don't know how familiar you are with this policy, but are there. Ms. I don't want to say mistakes. Are there things from your experiences that you would recommend in terms of changing, like, lessons learned? Like, one example is like, I've heard from B. General guidelines on B. Right. I heard from a lot of teachers already, and my personal experience is that they recommend not having cell phones also allowed during lunch. Right. So it should be. The policy should just be like, no cell phones during class time on campus.

start time: 384:44:46.000
end time: 384:48:30.000
confidence: 0.82
E: Right.

start time: 384:49:10.000
end time: 387:38:32.000
confidence: 0.94
H: So if students want to leave campus to go to lunch, because some high schools can. High school students can. They're allowed to be off campus and have their phones. So, like, what do you have? You know, that's one example but if you have more thoughts.

start time: 387:40:56.000
end time: 440:09:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Well, just the example you just gave. Students having their smartphones during lunch. At Grant, students will not have access to their cell phones throughout the school day, including passing time and at lunch often that is when we see some of the more problematic behaviors. And so students will not have access to the devices during that time as well. At Grant, my goal, our goal is to give students a seven hour respite from this technology that we're seeing cause so many issues. And you're right, we did have a pretty robust cell phone policy this past year. It was about a year ago. I shared it with our community and our teachers and cell phones had to be put away during class time. I purchased caddies for each classroom, so students were expected or required to put their cell phones in the caddies. It happened much of the time, but not all the time. We had teachers who were on top of it all the time. Unfortunately, it wasn't true with all of our teachers. I mean, I must have taken away probably about 3, 400 cell phones myself this year from students who had them during class time. You know, they never put in a caddy. And now, you know, you know, notification has gone off and there in the hallway. And it was very seldom that I ever saw a student going to the restroom without their cell phone and reading their cell phone. And so we really, we tried this past year and unfortunately it was not successful. On top of that, you know, with as many teachers we have, every day there's going to be subs. And you know, I would go into a classroom where I know we had subs and licking those caddies and no cell phones. And so then I would have to be principal, right, and do what I needed to do. You know, our students, our current students, you know, someone asked me, did you do a survey of the students? I did talk to roughly maybe about 25, 30 students prior to sending it out. But the reality is I did not need to send out a survey to know students were not going to be happy with this, you know, and me being me, you know, we don't ask students, you know, to complete a survey on whether or not they want healthy meals, you know, and I see it the same way. And so I've been pleased by the response because receive from parents, overwhelming majority of parents are in support of it, you know, because they're struggling as well, you know, to put these limits when it comes to technology on their students.

G: I'm not sure if you all have seen the research, but we can share some of the research with you around cell phones creating this same feelings as drugs, that addiction behavior happens with a cell phone. Some students are able to manage it more easily than others, depending on what their parents, how their parents train them at home, or what the parents expectations are. Additionally, it affects their ability to stay focused because with the messages or little prompts they get, every couple of minutes, two or three minutes, a lot of times the students will have their phones turned off, but it may be on vibrate. So any friend, your mom, grandma, someone sends you a message every couple of minutes, you're pulling it out of your pocket. Okay, who sent me a message? They're easily distracted with all of the constants, messages or notifications that they're getting from their phones. And it's all day long, hundreds of notifications throughout the day each student receives. And so do we want them to focus on their instruction or do we want them to focus on their device and the notifications? If we look at statistics, you know that international test exam is done. American students are behind. We want our students to be able to compete internationally with other countries, so they're getting the best possible education, they're getting the best possible access to instruction so they can compete with their peers around the world. This is one way to help them stay focused and to experience that. What is the term they use for struggle, the productive struggle, right. With their education. If you're reading something, you're not sure. Okay, let me think about it. Being able to help them develop critical thinking skills. We need our kids to have everything that everyone else has around the world. Cell phones. The cell phones are distractions. And if we can remove that distraction, I believe you can see some of the studies at other schools around the country that have used this technology or this device to help to keep the technology put away during the day. Test scores do go up.

start time: 483:05:40.000
end time: 498:58:00.000
confidence: 0.92
E: And along those same lines, I must say this. Cell phones and the challenges with cell phones is affecting all of our kids. But it's having a profound effect, I believe, on our lower performance students. You know, they are intentionally or unintentionally using it as an active distraction. And because there is not a really, I want to say, robust cell phone policy, you know, sometimes teachers don't know how to respond. You know, again, we've been very clear at Grant, you know, our expectations, expectation. But we see it every single day. Students who we need to engage with is the cell phones. That is an impediment. Not the only one, but obviously it is a challenge.

E: Yeah, well, it's great hearing your guys experience as building leaders. I think my two questions will be will students be allowed to have their phones if they're on a field trip and if they eat off campus?

start time: 507:35:00.000
end time: 514:36:20.000
confidence: 0.95
G: I would say no. When two students are on field trips, they with adults. I know at the middle school it's a 1 to 10 ratio. All the adults have a cell phone. If there's an emergency, whatever venue they're at, there are telephones there. So if someone had to call 911 or a parent, they have all the information that they need as adults and then that way students can fully engage in the experience.

start time: 514:56:00.000
end time: 519:55:20.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Also, there are handheld unlocking devices that we are requiring our teachers when they go on a field trip to take one of them. So if there was a reason where students needed those yonder pouches unlocked, they would have the ability.

A: What about. So at lunchtime all the high school campuses, or almost all of them are open. So. So whether you have the underpatches or not, essentially you go out, if you're Cleveland like my daughter was, you go over to Powell to grab something to eat. But the assumption would be they wouldn't have their phones with them.

end time: 531:49:00.000

B: I wanted to bring somebody else to the table because I think one of the things as we're looking at sort of our general educational settings, these are really good questions. But there are some. And that's why there's some movement in the proposed policy because we have some alternative programs that operate a little differently. Karina Wolf, if you could come up and kind of speak to some of the needs of the programs that you oversee. And there are things like reconnection services, alliance, those schools.

F: Hi, good afternoon. So within alternative ed. Thank you for the question, Mary. So within alternative ed, lots of people have seen and referenced that Mount Scott is a contracted private alternative school that we have approximately 160 students attend and they implemented yonder multiple years ago and they have a closed campus and it has worked really well for them. We have other alternative schools, MLC as an example in district, it's a K12 that has a 712 cell phone policy. They have a Written agreement that they have student sign, parents sign and their homeroom teacher sign. And they have it demonstrated what happens with the first infraction, the second infraction and the third infraction and it's gone wonderfully. We also have alliance who those teachers also there's two campuses, alliance campuses. The teachers at alliance at MEEC started exploring. Some teachers did a great, fantastic job getting information and exploring different resources. They actually went to visit Pacific Crest and some other folks and had yonder folks come last year, I guess and they were very interested in implementing. We had some questions because we had not had as an in district school had these questions come to the surface yet. So brought some of those questions back to Mary Kane and legal counsel this year the alliance teachers have.

start time: 572:49:50.000
end time: 573:04:22.000

A: They have.

end time: 605:50:18.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Principal Ferguson took a survey at the end of the school year and it's really different by campus. So the teachers at the five day campus, the meet campus, the survey showed that they overwhelmingly would like yonder or wanted a school those pouches and the teachers and community at alliance at Kenton and the reconnection services really feel strongly against and that it's detrimental and a barrier to wondering about to what degree is it a barrier when we're trying to reengage students who've been out of school, students who are parents, students who are working, students who care for others. So just what are the thoughts and considerations for older students or students who again we're trying to re engage. And so part of what the feedback at this point was with the guidance from Dr. Franco is really looking at what is which I'm hearing from Principal McGee and Dr. V is looking at where are schools in implementing a school wide cell phone policy and how has that gone? How are teachers and staff kind of coalescing and getting some shared experience around what a school wide cell phone policy is prior to asking for or requesting the yonder pouches. So we're in that process. But I would say within alternative ed some schools there's. It's a variation and it fits within the school model. I mean that's really kind of the guidance or the kind of guiding factor. So I don't disagree with anything I've heard colleagues say. And we're looking at what are different communities of learners and what is a different impact. So happy to answer any other questions.

F: And I would also just as a comment, I would just say in the MLC cell phone policy, students do get their cell phones at lunch and that's part of the policy that they get their cell phones at lunch and then they turn them back in after lunch.

start time: 628:53:30.000
end time: 632:36:20.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Unless the school has a stricter policy. So that's the flexibility I was talking about. So for certain schools, they may determine that that's keeping that seven hours of social media freedom.

end time: 637:23:40.000
confidence: 0.92
D: I think it's really compelling that what you said, Principal Monkey, about when you're noticing things are happening, bad behaviors are happening, specifically at lunchtime and at hall passing times is important to make a note of at your building.

confidence: 0.93
A: So I'm just noting in one E at the very end of the paragraph, that's where it says the school administrator might establish and enforce a stricter policy. So it seems. Yeah, so it seems like if that's the general philosophy about any of this, then it should be a standalone piece. Or is it just they can establish a stricter policy around the hours or around the confiscation? Because it seems like that instead of applying to the whole policy applies to just two of the clauses.

start time: 653:51:26.000
end time: 654:11:42.000

A: Applies to those clauses.

start time: 654:32:46.000
end time: 658:28:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: But that's another policy decision for the board. How much discretion would individual schools have for the entire. I mean, I assume it's not the entire policy, but that's. Again, there are a number of ways for the board to craft this.

E: Okay.

start time: 658:41:18.000
end time: 664:10:14.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So I think that's the question we shall come back to because. Because to me there's some other, like the videos or photos, I guess. What do you think? Do you think I should apply the full policy or just those two items that you could establish as something stricter than the district wide policy?

start time: 664:11:42.000
end time: 668:44:32.000
confidence: 0.91
H: I was actually wondering if we might even want to add something because at the end 1F says that nothing of the policy should interfere with the student's individual education plan. Right. So there's exceptions. Should we also include exceptions for like alternative programs, for example?

start time: 668:45:36.000
end time: 668:55:40.000
confidence: 0.68
A: Right.

start time: 669:12:40.000
end time: 677:13:16.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Can I just say one thing? I would think that a sentence around unless the school has a stricter policy seems like it would cover it. I'm actually Thinking of our day and resident kids in Dan residential treatment who have lots of technology restrictions in addition. But just a blanket sentence would cover it. That's what I. I think the way that it was if there was a sentence like that for the whole policy or that either.

start time: 677:15:08.000
end time: 677:35:40.000

end time: 679:57:00.000
confidence: 0.91
F: But if it's somehow referenced unless the school has a stricter policy then I think that's a good catchment for some other needs. Excuse me, Dr. Beat, were you going to say something?

start time: 679:59:00.000
end time: 684:50:20.000
confidence: 0.95
G: I'm just going to mention too there are some students that use their device to monitor their glucose numbers. So there are some yonder pouches that would meet their need where they'd be able to manage their medication and numbers without interference of the pouch.

start time: 685:18:40.000
end time: 686:24:20.000

start time: 709:42:58.000
end time: 715:58:00.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Or the others. Catch all you have still because it may not be an IEP or 504. So it's just adding in Spanish and it has often been raised like just in the last couple months as a reason not to do it. So I think we should just be explicit like this. We're not trying to.

start time: 716:31:00.000
end time: 723:11:20.000
confidence: 0.96
E: May I jump in? I do think we have to be specific because when we say medical needs that could be anything and we could have parents who use it for any reasons even like anxiety where the research is telling us that this is leading to anxiety. We will get those requests, I promise you.

start time: 723:17:40.000
end time: 737:07:20.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I'm going to ask staff to come up with the next meeting. Some sort of language that is specific enough but that does that. I don't think we need to resolve it right now. So I'm gonna. I think we've one section. I think, I think we should have two adds to the beginning of the policy. One, just a value statement. And we may take some language specifically from Director Wong's like, why are we doing this? I think it's always good to lay out your values. So have a value statement at the beginning. And then I also think we should have a definition section just so we don't clunkily. It makes it easier then to read the policy.

end time: 748:54:20.000
confidence: 0.94
D: May I add, I do want to see the peer reviewed research, if you would be so kind to share that. And because it helps us decide what we're kind of solving for. You mentioned some of the things students being able to talk to each other, having the skills to speak to the teachers and their peers. We're trying to solve for that. We're trying to solve for a sense of Surgeon General talked about social media, loneliness.

start time: 754:21:30.000
end time: 756:43:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: So I'd like to see the research so we can put that kind of preamble up front in the policy and we can understand what we're trying to solve and it could be a value statement.

start time: 757:33:30.000
end time: 759:39:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: All right, I have three questions, but I'll just ask them one at a time. So my first question as like a medical issue, would mental health count as one?

start time: 760:14:50.000
end time: 760:58:30.000
confidence: 0.82
A: Well, we have counselors and school buildings.

start time: 761:07:00.000
end time: 776:45:40.000
confidence: 0.95
G: When students have incidences of anxiety or other mental health crises, we definitely get them connected with a staff member in the building that has the training to support their needs. So I think that if a student has, for example, at Beaumont in the office, we have little slips for students to sit. I need to talk to this person or I need to talk to a counselor. I need to talk to somebody now. They can come to the office. Also say, I need to talk to someone right now. And we find them someone to talk to, to communicate with, whether it's their parent or their counselor or their private counselor. In some cases, we do have private counselor phone numbers. So the individuals that work with outside of the building, they're able to talk with them in times of crisis.

start time: 776:59:20.000
end time: 778:27:40.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And then my next question is, would this policy apply to contracted alternative schools as well?

start time: 778:47:20.000
end time: 779:04:16.000
confidence: 0.99
I: That's a good question.

start time: 779:05:28.000
end time: 785:29:40.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Thank you. So contracted alternative schools are their own organizations and so with their own boards and they set their own policies. And so what, what they do is they crosswalk our, they would crosswalk our policies. So they have some liberties. So not as kind of overarching policies.

start time: 785:38:00.000
end time: 785:52:48.000

A: They do.

start time: 785:55:04.000
end time: 788:49:00.000
confidence: 0.93
F: And we have some unique ways of how we can crosswalk. So there's some flexibility for them in their organization, from their organizations or within our contracts with them.

start time: 788:58:00.000
end time: 791:31:20.000
confidence: 0.91
E: And then my next question would be, would students be allowed to bring like their personal devices, for example, like iPads, like MacBooks, Chromebooks, from home to school and will they be allowed to use that?

start time: 791:47:00.000
end time: 799:46:50.000
confidence: 0.94
G: We discourage that because if it's lost, stolen or broken by another student, the school, the district will not replace it. Every student has been assigned a device that they can use. If that one breaks, they get a loaner device from the school. So they're able to get a device during the school day if they need it. Personal devices can get stolen, they can get broken by someone and then you have parents arguing about who's going to pay for the repair. So we discourage personal devices.

start time: 800:23:10.000
end time: 803:09:58.000
confidence: 0.92
E: And it's also easier to monitor or eliminate apps when we're using district issued devices. Thank you. Great.

confidence: 0.95
A: I'm going to keep this moving because I just want to be cognizant of time. So I think covered A, B and C. I think there's a decision around lunchtime and whether we want to include that or not. I'm assuming on D there's not really any issue. The only thing I would ask is I'm assuming this is when they're on school grounds which might need to be added.

end time: 818:15:30.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Also on this one, on D, I'm sorry, I just lost my train of thought. But that's students must comply anytime a request is made. But that also places the burden on that staff, which I thought that was one thing we were also trying to solve for was putting the students, the teachers, in a position of having to police.

start time: 818:20:30.000

confidence: 0.95
E: Policing is a strong word. Tier 1 intervention, start in the classroom. And so there's a certain level of expectation that we should have of our teachers. And so I am. And at the same time I want to eliminate the power struggles between a student, you know, not wanting to give up their cell phone and the teacher, you know, demanding it. But there has to be, there has to be buy in from the entire school staff. And I think that is. I think that's really important because I don't think that's the case now. And I think that's something that has to be figured out. And I'm not just talking about teachers. I'm also talking about RCSAs, you know, because it's not clear whether or not they gather cell phones. And so there's some of the things I think has to be addressed as well.

start time: 836:49:20.000
end time: 843:34:54.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Okay, now we're getting to when it gets confiscated. I wonder if you can speak to one of the things. Some of the feedback we've heard is that this is more from my parents and guardian or caregiver. Like, I'm all for this, but I, you know, have a job where I can't come pick up my student. So I'm curious, what. Do you require a parent or guardian or is that. Do you have something you'd recommend?

start time: 843:37:02.000
end time: 859:29:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yes. Before I answer that question, I do want to acknowledge that, you know, at the start of the school year, you know, we will be looking at, you know, just the implementation of our policy. I have no doubt that there's some blind spots here and we'll address those as they arise. The. But yes, if we take a cell phone from a student, a parent or guardian must pick it up. And if they cannot be there at 4:00, which is the time our office is closed, it'll be there the next day. Because after all, the student has. We have a policy and you don't get to pick and choose which policies you're going to follow. And so if a kid misbehaves, well, we require a parent or guardian to come in to address the issue. Like if there's a fighting, if there's a drug infraction. And so this would just follow along those same lines.

start time: 860:00:20.000
end time: 865:32:22.000
confidence: 0.96
B: It seems that there was some. I don't know if it was LA or New York, some policy I looked at where the first time the phone was taken away, student could pick it up at the end of the day, second time the parent has to come or so there was an escalation.

E: Right. And we did that this past year and without much success. You know, it's just very clear, you know, when you fight, you know, on school grounds, there's a clear expectation what the discipline is going to look like. And it was very important to me that we didn't go from 0 to 100. You know, we implemented a very robust cell phone policy this past year. And it was important to me that I think to both of us that we shared this with our communities this past school year. So everyone was aware, you know, we had an open house to discuss it at Grant, and then there was one at Beaumont as well. Our parents could go to either one of them. The one at Grant, I believe. We had eight folks show up, three were students, and you can speak for Beaumont, but our families were made aware of this this past school year and understand that we'll be sending out the policy to them within the next two weeks.

E: Yeah, it was. You know, I'll be honest with you. When I sent this out to the families and students, by the time I sent it to the students, they knew it was coming because I shared it with the teachers the previous day, and so it was being leaked, and so the students knew about it. But yet still, when I hit that, you know, send button to our students and families, I braced myself, you know, to see what was going to be the pushback. To my surprise, you know, there has been, I would say 90% of the conversations I've had with families have been positive. Not even, like, I'm fine with this. You know, some of them are. Hallelujah. You know, I just had one of those parents at our lunch alumni association picnic on Sunday said that, you know, and I live in the community, and so parents don't have, you know, they don't have a problem stopping me at Fred Meyers. And the parents have been very happy, and they have acknowledged their kids aren't happy about it. But it's been a. The response has been more positive than I expected. Sure.

G: I will say the same case at Beaumont. We had very few parents show up. However, the ones that did show up were enthusiastic. We shared with our pta. We shared in the written communication the same as Grant, and we have not received a lot of emails showing concern or questioning this idea. So in our minds, it's like, yay, they're for it.

A: And it does. I guess there is a sort of safety valve that. Or as determined by the school administration. So say somebody has a job where they just, like, can't even come the next day because there could be some communication between the parent and the administrator that allows for something else.

B: Of a how to implement the policy. So if the policy is often a way students don't have cell phones, then would e more fall under a how.

start time: 925:41:54.000
end time: 935:24:06.000
confidence: 0.93
A: To make that happen? Maybe in an ad or a school specific policy. It's a wonderful, I guess I think we should have in the policy because I think that should just be the expectation, like the first level what happens if you violate the policy. I think there's a lot of other details that can go on the ad, but I think there's some basic things because like you don't have any right to take my phone and just it takes, I think the conversation away from the teacher or the principal.

start time: 935:25:58.000
end time: 962:57:40.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Right. And also that I heard the word emergency used. You know, we've been very clear with our students and our families that if there's an emergency, they can come to the main office and call a parent or guardian, whomever, and parents can also call us. I actually, it was a year ago when I sent that original email out about our new cell phone policy. I asked parents to refrain from calling their students during the school day and please, you know, just limit to emergencies and call the main office. But still this school year, you know, I'm talking with a student about something that they may have done and the phone ring And I'm like, Mr. McGee, hold your point. And I'm like, really? You're going to answer your phone right now? And that's my mom. And more than once it went something like this, well, no, mom, you know, we had spaghetti last week. We need something different, you know, and so it's even those type of things. And I'm not trying to make light of it, but as administrators, you know, we're evaluating our teachers. And so we're often in the classroom in the back. Typically I'm in the back of a classroom watching the teacher. But I can't help but notice students getting notifications on their cell phones. And they know, they know me quite well and they know I'm back there. But it's so difficult for them to avoid the temptation of looking. And so again, just, you know, another example of the challenges that our teachers face as they're trying to engage students in the classroom.

start time: 963:14:00.000
end time: 971:41:20.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I think that going to the principal's office and making a phone call there, I know that we've got a generation of kids, and my kids include that literally do not know how to pick up the phone. This is not a phone to them. It's everything else. Talk about the skill of talking on the phone and walking down the hallway to make an emergency call. So I hope that we allow for some Time for students to learn how to. Jj, over here.

start time: 972:02:20.000
end time: 990:18:30.000
confidence: 0.94
E: I actually had a student, and they will adapt. I have a student that, you know, great kid, came to me and said, Mr. McGee, can we do a video about the new cell phone policy? And I said, hmm, hadn't thought about that. You know, I said, what do you mean? What would we do? And she said, well, you know, just take a video. You can use me on how to use the phone. And I said, use the phone? What do you mean? She said, well, if I want to call my mom, how do I use this phone to be able to do so? And it was a reminder how old I am. Because many of our students, to your point, do not know how to use the traditional phones. And so if needed, we will absolutely, you know, show them. It won't take long, but it is, I mean, just an example that it is a different world that they're growing up in and the realization that they have normalized some of these problematic behaviors because they don't know any better.

start time: 990:44:50.000
end time: 1008:47:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So one thing also is the incoming from the parents. And sometimes when I call the main line of a school, because I happen to do that, you. You get an automated response, and frankly, like, there might be eight choices, and the last one is like, stay in the line if you want to talk to somebody or if you want to talk to the principal. But it seems like we should also ask the schools to look. To consider what. Knowing that now parents, if there's some sort of emergency, they won't be able to call. They won't be able to call their students, they're going to be calling the schools. Because it seems like basically, I feel like sometimes when I call school, you get a. We don't really want you to leave a message or you're not going to leave a live person. And I could see if a parent was like, you're not allowing me to call my child. So just thinking about, like, reverse engineering what it's like to be a parent with an emergency. And I used to be able to just call my child, but now I'm going to have to call the office that I actually get through to somebody.

start time: 1008:48:30.000

confidence: 0.94
E: No, absolutely. We've just had this conversation last week with my business manager, and that's a horrible title for what she does, but she works with our secretaries very closely. And so we're trying to change our system to ensure that parents can get a live person as soon as possible and making sure we have dedicated phones that are only used for students who need to outreach to their parent or Employer for whatever reason.

I: Is it okay if I jump in? It sounds like there was a request to hear from some other schools in addition and I don't have principals here with me, but I do supervise our group of middle high school and multiple pathways programs. And it's clear to me that not every school is in the same place. So clearly these two schools are ahead of some schools in terms of the pre work that they have done. One of the schools that I supervise is Benson High School, which I know has had teachers offer public comment here on this topic. My understanding of where Benson is is really working to clarify the policy for next year. They have a committee that's working on this issue. They've done the survey, but they are not at the place where they are committing to purchase yonder pouches.

start time: 1036:19:02.000

A: I think they want to try and.

end time: 1053:45:12.000
confidence: 0.95
I: See if the new interventions that they have offered are going to take hold. So that is one example that I can share. I can also share that the middle schools that I supervise are. They all have an expectation that phones are often away during instructional time. One school, Da Vinci, it's often away all day. So they're at a different place where they, those principals are not coming to me saying it's, you know, we have this expectation but it's out of control. That is not what I'm hearing. I'm hearing that, you know, there are some infractions but we are working through a process. So I just want to offer that it sounds like the policy is broad enough to allow schools that are at the point that Beaumont and Grant are at if move forward in that direction can do so and that not all.

start time: 1053:45:36.000
end time: 1069:12:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Schools are at that same place. Yeah, I think it's important to note that the policy as it's currently constructed doesn't say what the intervention is like a yonder pouch. So it's more setting I think the district wide set of expectations and support maybe at future meeting Director Wong's what the district shall provide the necessary support and resources for the schools to implement the policy that maybe we get that, but we don't. The policy as contemplated isn't like this is how you have to implement or the tool that's not how it's currently crafted. But it does set an expectation of a district policy which even if the principals aren't saying it, we're hearing it from a lot of places that it would be helpful to have one standard so it doesn't change from school to school or classroom to classroom.

D: I appreciate hearing the range of support and people's Considerations. But I'm really interested in looking at the peer reviewed research, empirical research, and if we're trying to solve for our lowest performing kids, which is something we all need to focus on, that would be a really compelling thing to know school by school, based on racial and income demographics, how this is playing out. I would hate to have a policy that didn't apply to all of our schools and specifically for the schools that have our lowest performing kids.

confidence: 0.94
E: K8 and pre Ks have between 8 and 9 grade levels. And so the policies vary, but some are often away. Some schools like Beverly Clary K8 collect them during advisory first period and give them back at the end of the school day already for the most part though, it's variance by school to school. But most are often away for the majority of the day and if they violate multiple times they get picked up by the administrator. But it has not been as significant of an issue as it is I think in the comprehensive middle schools.

A: Okay, so I'm just going to say we already talked about F. I think what I want to do just given the time, because I want to make sure that we talk about the resolution, the disciplinary consequences. What I would like to have come back is like to me this just refers me to saying students refused to adhere to the policy. The school may be subject to just one as outlined as to students rights and responsibility handbooks. What is that?

A: Let me go, she's gonna save actually because of the time. What I would like to do is have it sent to us so we can see like what it is, what it is. Because that will give me a sense of like, which do we have something specific about cell phones in there? Or we can add something, but just like what that is because we did have some comments of like if students violate the cell phone policy, we don't want to have them like losing instructional time or just what is it? So getting it for the, for the next meeting and then this is a lot of the comment I think we got back from some of the teachers. We're now on the three staff responsibility for confiscated cellular phones. And then Eddie adding staff. The district will provide the necessary support and resources for the schools to implement the this policy. It will be I think for the next meeting like what, what is that? And I don't know that we need to put it in here but what things do we need to consider? Because it can't be like hey, if your school has a PTA that can buy resources, that's how you get to do it. If you don't, you're going to have to implement some other way. I don't know if you want to speak to this.

start time: 1131:00:10.000
end time: 1161:13:00.000
confidence: 0.94
H: I added cuz a couple concerns. So again c is the district shall provide the necessary support and resources for a school to implement this policy. The number one reason I the number one reason I thought this was important was because it's the number one thing. It serves as a value statement that the district is here to support our schools in order to implement something that we feel is good for our students, especially our students mental health. And then also came other reasons. As I was reading three like for example, three it gives specific instructions about if district employees take physical possessions. It has to be locked away securely. You can't just put it on an unlocked desk or cabinet. And I was worried that would become a liability for teachers because the reality of a teacher during classroom, especially if you have a class of 30, you're making 1,000 decisions a day or a minute. And so sometimes you have to decide, oh, am I going to take the time to lock this away and stop instruction for a minute. These kind of decisions are very difficult and I'm just thinking about the reality of the situation. So if one thing that we hate as a district is when the state gives us unfunded mandates when they make us do something but they don't give us the money to do it and we shouldn't, we want to make sure we don't do the same thing to our schools and our staff. So to make sure that yeah, if we're going to, if a school comes to us and says hey, we are almost there in implementing this policy but these are some barriers. It is our job to our job is PPS's district's job to make sure to provide what kind of the support necessary in order to get this done so that it has the most chance of success. And that's why I put that in there or suggested that.

start time: 1163:39:20.000
end time: 1174:25:10.000
confidence: 0.95
H: The thing is, I purposely left it vague. And the reason for purposely leaving it vague is because what we need changes. Right. For example, what if we, after the experiment that you two are carrying out in your schools, we find out that these pouches are awesome and they're a lifesaver. Great. This provides for that. But what if we find out those are not the solution? Maybe there's a better one somewhere else. It provides for that too. Or maybe it's support. Maybe we just need to send people to get in there and help implement systems. Right. It could be that. Right. And the reason I purposely left Vegas because then it's adaptable to our changing times.

H: To do that piece. What you need is, you know, distinct guidelines and calibration of what these things mean. And then I think James had said it, it's a collective approach with the staff. Right. Because we have schools who are obviously not using yonder who have very successful cell phone policies with often away and those types of things. And so I just want to make sure that if we do put the.

H: Necessarily a dollar amount that's attached to that. It could be, you know, coaching on what is an effective policy without the use of like a yonder or that type of thing. And I just want to make sure I just put it, put that out there because I mean, yonder does come with the cost. So could we answered that question by incentive. The district shall provide the necessary support and resources, but change that to and or resources. So the district shall provide the necessary support and or resources for the school to implement this policy.

A: Done. So I think this is a good time to transition. I super appreciate all the input and the wisdom and the insights that was offered today. And it's a good way to transition. Because just briefly, thing we're going to cover before we get to your resolution is the engagement. So we have included in the documents that were shared. There was a meeting with JJ and Frankie and Dr. Adams myself about designing a student survey. And so what you have in your packet is the timeline that Dr. Adams put together, which basically lays out a timeline by which we get a survey in the field and work with all of us and students on student reps on what to include in the survey. And then we would have that data coming back. In addition, focus groups with the schools that currently have that will be like leading the way this fall that have tools and school wide policies. So. And we'll add in Cleveland in there as well because apparently they're going to have restrictions as well. But that'll give us an opportunity not only to hear from students who. This is a prospective concept, but also hopefully hear from students who are actively in the process of having school without their phones. Did you want anything?

start time: 1233:13:10.000
end time: 1234:42:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yeah. I was wondering if staff or if you could clarify what would the focus groups look like at Grant and Beaumont?

start time: 1234:54:30.000
end time: 1250:48:46.000
confidence: 0.93
A: We don't have Dr. Adams here yet, but generally focus groups allows you to get more in depth feedback as allows you to do follow up questions. It's pretty standard in polling when you're trying to survey opinions, to do a poll which has some open ended, like here's a variety of responses, but then to also add in focus groups because it allows you to have a deeper conversation and to do follow ups. So that's what we were thinking, that it would be valuable to have a deeper set of conversations, maybe a different set of questions. And also you can adjust the questions in a focus group, whereas you can with the survey because it's kind of a set thing. But you can adjust based on what's being elicited or the feedback you're getting. You can decide to go deeper in a particular place or skip a topic altogether.

start time: 1250:51:58.000
end time: 1258:03:50.000
confidence: 0.92
D: I'll just add also. So the survey is very quantitative numbers, percentages of people that agree and disagree. And the focus groups are qualitative. So yeah, to Julia's point, expanded on questions, kind of teasing out more, you know, deeper information about the. Were you asking about though how they would. What the makeup of the focus groups would be like, who would be invited.

start time: 1258:05:10.000
end time: 1258:41:30.000

end time: 1277:00:00.000
confidence: 0.92
A: I think we're gonna have Dr. Adams answer that question because generally you try and get a representative sample, not just people who opt in, but more of a representative sample of the student body or whatever the group is you're surveying or putting in your focus group and in terms of how they actually would be run. Usually you have somebody who the way Generally is the focus group happens is you pull together the representative sample, you share what you're trying, you give them an overview. You share with what you're trying to accomplish or what information you're trying to get. Generally it's like how it will be used and then it's like a conversation guided by the person who's in the group. It's usually somebody who's skilled and that's what they do. I'm going to also connect you with Dr. Adams.

start time: 1277:05:40.000
end time: 1281:05:20.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Also those groups you want to make sure there's a broad range of opinions in the room and you've got, you know, income, race, all diversity. You know, you want to hear from as broad a range of people as possible. Maybe different geographies.

start time: 1281:20:20.000
end time: 1286:24:06.000
confidence: 0.95
A: It's usually not self selected so you try and get a representative. It's used all the time in political campaigns, but sometimes in campaigns it's like we want to hear from, you know, parents who are between 40 and 60.

A: And you can create a focus group around that because what you're trying to accomplish but in this case it would be at the individual school. It's a representative sample versus versus just saying hey, do you want to. Who wants to participate in a focus group? Then becomes a self select also. We'll so again really appreciate all the feedback and insights from the schools. Very helpful. And we'll also be looking at how we engage and appreciate how we engage with teachers and other staff. Andy, thanks for already bringing a lot of information in and I know I'm getting a lot of emails from school staff already and we'll also, I think we're all hearing from parents already but figure out some other ways to solicit. Not just the sort of yes or no, but maybe some nuances or what are the most common. And I think one of the things that that would have value is like to come up with a FAQ just so people aren't necessarily going to weigh in the policy but more have questions about how it gets implemented or what does it mean.

A: Already have nuances to the policy and those will be further outlines. It's like, I think directionally we know where we want to head based on what we know are the values. But also there's a lot of other things in here that aren't just like yes or no, it's how it's done. Discipline.

A: Or like, and sometimes just a survey, you find out like it's less about yes or no, but more about what are the questions people have. But there may be like an intensity. Like, definitely not during class time, but maybe like at school activities or I don't know, but that's a wolf. Find out the intensity of opinion. So the next item on the agenda, and I'm just going to say because of the time, I don't want to. We can save it for another meeting. But I want to have a conversation about legislation that passed last year around stipends for board members. And for me, this is an equity issue that's been raised a lot over the years of like, the people who have privileged to serve on the school board have privilege because they have the resources that they can give a lot of volunteer time. And not everyone's in that position. We also all have different responsibilities, whether it's children or all the reasons why prevent people from running for the school board. So I want to start having a conversation about that and then because we have three brave schools leading the way this fall on the cell phone and that there's a lot of other schools that are very interested in following for the value reasons that have been raised. Director Wong, you proposed a. We have a draft in our. In the meeting materials, a draft of resolution. And my understanding is this is. Would be. So to set the tone of like, why we're doing this work. We should have it in the policy also, because that's the timeless thing. But just to sort of set the tone for the broader school community to. Why don't you share the outline of.

H: Thank you. And thank you, Director Brainmeyers, for giving time for this, because I feel this is a very important issue. So one of the biggest issues I want to address with this resolution. And again, this is the first time we're introducing it. Just soliciting input from everyone. This is draft and big bold letters. One of the biggest problems, you know, as. Because PPS is such a big district, you know, it's like a big boat. Right. It takes a long time to turn to change direction. And not only that, but we don't want to rush things and potentially do things unwell. We want to make sure we do it smart. And unfortunately, that just takes time. Right. We just looked at the calendar outline about, you know, we're collecting data this, and, you know, it goes all the way to October before possibly some kind of policy getting in place. Right. And that's kind of just the reality we deal with. At the same time, we're hearing from a lot of law teachers and law admin. They're asking for something to be done. And we, as a board and as a district, you know, are responsible to them and want to respond to that. And so one of the, one, the. One of the issues that I'm trying to address here is that educators at admin know the first couple weeks of school are really vital in terms of establishing routine and expectations among students. I mean, that for, you know, I've read so many classroom management books that says that's the first, you know, the first two weeks, what you've got to focus on. And right now we have a district where policies are kind of all over the place, right? We have some schools that are very strict and some are not. And. And we have a lot of teachers, as we just saw in that survey, something like 88, maybe 90% of teachers are in that survey saying that cell phones are a problem. Right. And it would be kind of remiss of us to not respond to that. So the main goal of this draft resolution, and here I want to be very specific, I want to make sure this resolution was not a directive. I wanted to be more of a statement of values, right. And to show, to give, you know, I, I guess this is a very difficult thing to. I guess my ask, my big ask here for this policy committee is how do we do something that's not a directive? But it also show the district that we are moving in a direction. And so if you want to, you know, kind of like, maybe there's some people who are on the edge of doing something, maybe giving a little nudge, being like, yeah, we're going to do something. And so if you want to do it, do it. Because we know that setting expectations the first couple weeks of school is absolutely vital. So the point of this resolution is to kind of respond to our employees and what they're asking for and say, hey, we heard you, and we are trying to do something. We're trying to do something. Well, and we're going to do something. And so that's the point of this draft. And also, again, once again, centering our students in the middle of this conversation we were talking about, I love the way to put it, we're giving a seven hour respite from these devices that we have so much peer review, peer reviewed studies that show that it is a cause. Not the cause. Right. But a factor in mental health issues today. And this is not something that we can solve as a school. Unfortunately, it's not something we can solve as a school. It will require community and community help. It will require our society to help our parents, our guardians, our students to be all in it. But what can we do? So again, we're trying to rephrase this as a value statement. So with that said, I would love anyone and any everyone's input.

And to your point, it's hard to get everyone to put their shoulders to the wheel to steer the ship in the right direction. And I think it's signals that something's coming. It's a way of bringing the community along. And yeah, I think it's great. I appreciate you drafting it. I don't have any critical comments at this point, but I just want to appreciate you for putting it out here.

A: We'Re just beginning. Okay. So my feedback is in the. Thanks for putting this together. My quick review of it is in the recitals. I would make sure that we're sort of paralleling the language in the draft policy. So whatever it is we're calling them here, you call it personal smart devices. But we should have some consistency of language in the recitals. I would add in references to the surgeon general's report and perhaps some of the peer reviewed. Just it's good in the recitals to build the case for why you're doing it on E. It says will no longer be able to access their cell phones. I would say have restrictions on their cell phones because having the access assumes that. Well there's. It sounds like even across the three schools it's somewhat different. So I would just be like there's restrictions at those schools on cell phones and other devices. Or again, using consistent language with the policy. Then in the resolved the second sentence. PPS Board of education is committed to supporting student mental health and learning and recognizes that creating. And then I would add a district wide board policy because I think the thinking here is like we're doing something district wide that's going to apply to everyone. Which is what I've heard from teachers is like we don't want to have like different school by school or classroom by classrooms. I would say. And then I would be clear the verb restricting the use of whatever we're going to call them versus just on the use. It's like clear that there's going to be restrictions. It's not just a policy on them. It's written into that sentence. This is critical for students to achieve how to add academic outcomes we believe they're capable of. And then I, I would add something on the mental health improvements that we want to see. Number two, I would actually shorten the piece about like adding the specificity about student engagement. I'm not sure that we need the specificity. I think you were saying just do a combination of a survey and some focus groups. But I would add in that we're also going to solicit the feedback from school staff, parents and family district administrators so that it's broader and our labor union partners. I think we should call that out. And then I would add a number three that I think, Eddie, this goes to the point that you really have raising is something to the effect of educators. School administrators and staff will be engaged on how best the district can support the implementation of the proposed policy. Just signaling that's the place core value. So those are. That's mine. I will.

A: Getting too specific on time? Here's what my suggestion would be. I think we can speak to that. Perhaps it's the aspiration. I also think we're setting aside time this fall to really solicit a lot of information from A lot of different schools who are in different places that if we say we're going to do it here like this particular date, they're just going to rush to me that. And maybe not listen to us or I think it's better to get it right than to. I think we can speak to that and put it in the resolution and certainly we can build the committee schedule so that we need that and the 21 days public comment and everything else, but keep our eye on that as the target without.

I: I'm an education researcher and I also have student at Roosevelt High School. So I'm a parent and I just want to thank you. This has been a great discussion. I am really happy that you all are talking about putting a cell phone restriction policy in place. And I am really worried about both student learning, student skill development and teacher burnout with the current state of things as I'm seeing them and hearing about. So I was on the site council this year at Roosevelt and we spent most of the time talking about cell phone policy to roll out this coming year. And that work was led by. That planning work was led by the climate team at Roosevelt, Sophie Hanashian and Kira Se. And at the beginning of those conversations, I asked the principal at Roosevelt if it would be helpful if the district, district had a policy. And her response there was a resounding yes, yes, I need something to, you know, you guys are offering to take the heat and I think that is super helpful. We had really broad consensus about the problems that cell phones have introduced in schools, but it was harder to figure out what to do. I think it's super helpful to hear what you've done at Grant and Beaumont, but we did hear a lot about how cell phones have negatively affected school climate and that there's escalation in student conflicts that sometimes staff don't even know about because it's happening online and so.

I: As you think about the language of the policy. I guess I'm thinking about what you said Director Wong, where I think policies in the research I do there are a lot of it's really in the implementation. Right. Like you can have things on the books and I think to be successful this is a really big culture shift in terms of students are used to having their phones and parents are used to being able to access their kids during the day. And so we're going to need help in terms of as parents to understand and I would encourage you to really think about that and can we have a district wide conversation about the harm that's being done? I think parents see we're used to the convenience but we don't actually see the degree of the harm that's happening and it's quite large. So I know at Grant they used some of the screenagers movies and they screened them at Roosevelt like the climate team looked at them and I wonder if that would be a tool, for example, something that the district could do. But I'd like love to see that. I think there's a lot of in the research and some of the guidance about how to do this. A lot of it is like it's not just about a policy, it's also about you start not just with asking for input, but education. And my final point would just be that I really agree about I do work on student voice and I think it's really important but I think it's very important to not ask for input when you're not genuine. So only put on the table the parts of it that are actually up for discussion and not if you know that like some things are not up.

D: I wanted to say I love that too. The idea of a community wide conversation about the harms, it's really compelling that the, you know, the people in Silicon Valley don't allow their children to have access to cell phones. And so yeah, I think the education piece is really important and I'd love to see us take the time to have conversations with people and also Young Community Engagement 101 When Something's Non negotiable, then that's not something that we discuss. But I think of what we're trying to solve. We know it's a mental health issue and we know of the dangers and we are morally obligated to do something about.
