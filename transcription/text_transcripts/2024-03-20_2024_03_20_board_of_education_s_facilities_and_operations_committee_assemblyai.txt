We're not voting on anything today, so most of this stuff is just presentations and what we can do, a quick round of introductions. All you gotta do is say your name, and we'll start over here with Ms. Kara Bradshaw. And then once we do that, we'll turn it over to Dan to start the presentations.

G: Thank you. Yes. Good evening once again, Steve Efros, senior Project manager in OSM for the Jefferson Modernization project. And we wanted to thank you again to the Facilities and Operations Committee for the opportunity for our project to present the status of the Jefferson High School project Pivot. So I'd like to first start with team introductions. Obviously, first, you've been introduced to Ayanna Horne, project manager for in OSM for the Jefferson Modernization. We also have Steffi Knudsen representing the Bora Lever design team and Brad Niall representing the Anderson Construction team and their consortium partners. Next slide. So here's our agenda for the evening. During this presentation, we'll be looking at comparing the old plan versus the new plan, reviewing the main components of the new plan, showing some conceptual Diagrams for the layout of the new building will be discussing athletics program impacts during construction, looking at feedback from the committee on our community outreach plan. We'll be detailing the current plan for permitting and we'll be reviewing the project schedule and budget. So I'd now like to hand it off to Ayanna to discuss the comparison of the old plan to the new plan.

start time: 60:42:10.000
end time: 129:07:56.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Thank you, Steve. Here we show you the old plan versus the new plan and the key to this strategy was first and foremost listening to the community's concerns surrounding the previous design requiring students to swing off site. We want to say that we heard you and have adjusted our design approach so that we are now recommending building north of the existing buildings closer to Killingsworth as directed by the school board. This will require building an all new building on the track and field and result in all new optimized fields for Jefferson High School when the project is complete. This is a similar approach to the Lincoln Modernization. Next slide. The project team has been primarily in a process of information gathering as we reorient ourselves to building on the new area of this site. We have been careful to incorporate feedback from previous engagement with the community. We have also met with the district departments such as Athletics, Security, Jefferson Administration and Visual and Performing Arts to understand how the major zones of the building are to be accessed. We also spoke with the City of Portland on requirements such as the cross block connection between the building and fields which is similar to the approach in the Lincoln design. The current program components have the main entry on Kirby, the arts programs, activating the street on Killingsworth and maintaining athletics along commercial. I'll hand this over to Steffi from Bora to talk about the planned test fits. Thanks. Next slide. So these layout diagrams are test fits that enable us to make sure that the program as required by the PPS High School Education specifications can fit on the area that we have. We also use this test fit process to determine how many floors are needed to fit that program and that helps estimate the cost in the construction schedule. This currently works out to a four story academic core which you can see here in blue with the remainder of the building being primarily two floors. The purple shows the arts programs located close to Killingsworth and the yellow represents the athletics along commercial. This is not a final design but rather an exercise that helps us identify where the challenges are as we do due diligence before starting design. Ayanna is going to now discuss impacts to the program. One program area, as you can see here, that is greatly affected by construction on our occupied site. Is athletics. We are still in the process of discussing program implications of the various construction and staging scenarios with athletics. Currently, the plan is that the 1964 main gym building will remain open during the course of construction until the new gym is open. Once construction starts, the football field and track will not be available during construction for four years from the fall of 2025 through the end of the summer of 2029. We are studying options for interim fields that balance cost, schedule impacts and athletic program support to best serve the students. Next Slide Here you see where we have are proposing a community outreach plan and we are looking for feedback on this strategy from the Board. In addition to our community updates that we have been emailing monthly, which you can find on the modernization website, we have also been meeting with internal district staff, Jefferson staff, as well as students. This plan proposes to expand engagement outside of those traditional groups. We believe that the Design Advisory group engagement to date has been too limited to reach the depth of the community this project needs. We are therefore proposing to evolve our engagement beyond the DAG and expand our outreach to be community wide. This list represents the categories of community we will be engaging with and are hopeful to work with the center for Black Excellence Advisory Committee to engage with their partner organizations. I will now hand it back to Steve who will discuss the permitting process.

start time: 129:09:58.000
end time: 190:24:30.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Thanks Ayanna so our new plan requires really a different approach to land use and permitting. The design is still required to be reviewed by the Historic Landmarks Commission and requires a separate conditional use review. Since our new approach will require require demolition of the existing 1909, which is considered a contributing resource to the Piedmont Conservation District, there is an approval process for that demolition. However, the HLC has indicated that due to the changes made to the building in the 1950s, they will support the demolition if we remove the contributing status of the 1909 building. So the timeline you see here reflects the sequence to remove that contributing status. There is risk to the project timeline during the appeals period or if the HLC does not approve the change in that status. However, we are moving forward with this process and our next steps are to submit the application to remove the contributing status. Go to the next slide. This slide shows the anticipated project design, land use and permitting and construction schedule. Building construction will begin in the fall of 2025 and after we finish the new building and move students in to start in the new building in the fall of 2028, we will finish we will demolish the existing buildings and finish the athletic fields. The athletic fields will be complete and ready to use in the summer of 2029. Go to the next slide. This slide shows the budget and is based on the new hard cost estimate from Anderson Construction and is split into hard costs and soft costs. You'll recognize this format because it is the same format OSM uses for every comprehensive plan. So to start with, for the hard costs, parallel cost estimates were prepared and reconciled by Anderson Construction and an independent cost estimator, rlb, based on their review of the new site and building construction components. The $407 million figure at the top is Anderson Construction's all in number for construction and they will be sharing more details of their estimating process during this pivot phase. That number also includes all of the state required 1.5% green energy technology and there are additional owner allowances included for significant right of way improvements and abatement costs. Secondly, the soft costs are based on both leveraging design and engineering work that has already occurred, as well as planning for owner costs that reflect the latest cost data we have from recent projects escalated to current dollars. Finally, there's contingency within the overall project budget that equals 10% of the total project costs based on requirements for new construction and the overall escalation for. The hard costs that you see here are shown through the middle of construction and are included in the hard cost estimate. Next slide. So this slide shows a further breakdown of current budget actuals to date and additional budget required based on the overall current budget estimate. The additional budget required based on these costs is about 125 million above the current budget and funding for this project. So I'd now like to hand this off to Brad Nile from Anderson Construction who will discuss the details of their estimating process.

start time: 191:06:10.000

confidence: 0.95
F: Okay, next slide. So what you see on this slide is our estimate summary in two basic blocks. On the left is a detailed breakdown direct cost of work categories, and on the right are indirect cost items that include escalation, contingency insurance, bonds and fees. I have a few points to make before moving on. Our team has been part of the project since April of 2023, so our estimate is based on a great deal of analysis and detail that we have fully shared in transparency with the entire team. We've gone through a rigorous process of compiling costs and obtaining logistics input from our consortium partners and trade partners. Because of the project pivot, we are starting construction one year later than originally planned and building a high school with an occupied campus lengthens the schedule by one year. These two years of escalation have a significant effect on the bottom line. One last Escalation point. The pricing includes escalation to August of 2027, which is roughly the midpoint of construction. More points. Our project is also the first school built under the district climate policy as well as the new resiliency and structural code requirements. And I would end by saying that we're confident in our analysis and estimate that our estimate accounts for the construction of a new building and fields while keeping students and safe. Students and staff safe while the campus is occupied. I'll hand it back to Steve.

end time: 244:31:06.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I'm trying to process what the question is of how to chunk it out because it's just a really big increase. I mean it will be. When Benson came In at what, 400, we were shocked. Something to come in at 490 is a half a billion dollar high school. If you were to divide the 124 into the components of what that is attributed to in terms of the increase. Percent.

start time: 248:11:30.000
end time: 254:36:20.000
confidence: 0.97
G: I mean, I think we've talked a lot about that exact issue and I think part of it. I think if you might want to talk a little bit about some of the key drivers, at least from the hard cost estimate side. I think we've talked about obviously escalation, but other impacts and maybe kind of discussing a little bit more in detail about that.

start time: 255:25:20.000
end time: 255:36:40.000
confidence: 0.78
A: Okay.

start time: 255:38:00.000
end time: 274:23:30.000
confidence: 0.94
F: The if so if we're looking back to the scheme that moves students off the site entirely. Where we saved the 1909 is that's essentially the differential we're speaking of the cost. Yeah, yeah. So. Well, a couple of points there. That was an unoccupied campus single phase. And so the logistical challenges of that were reduced. Saving the 1909 was actually less costly than constructing new. And I say that cautiously because it's a complicated formula that's not necessarily intuitive and I guess a few other points to make is that this is an all electric facility and our mechanical and electric costs, how would I say it can continue to be significant?

start time: 275:12:30.000
end time: 278:36:06.000
confidence: 0.95
B: The actual Components of the. The. So putting in an electric, electric infrastructure is how much more exponentially more expensive than.

start time: 278:37:18.000
end time: 280:47:30.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah, I'm not prepared to suppose what that exactly is at this time, but we could certainly dive into that.

start time: 284:04:20.000
end time: 291:30:09.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So at 490, what's the price per square footage? And I guess maybe Dan, this is going to go back to the conversations we had when we were talking about Benson and everybody was like, how can we pay 300 million? It's going to be the most expensive high school the state. And we looked at some comparators. Is that within the comparison of any other comparable project?

start time: 291:59:09.000
end time: 315:35:50.000
confidence: 0.92
E: I think a couple things I might ask the team to talk about some comparisons and actually one of the things we'll jump ahead to when we're talking about the bomb planning, it seemed appropriate to talk a little about construction cost estimating. And construction cost estimating generally for the last seven or eight years just hasn't been very accurate. With few exceptions, all of our projects, every estimate at every phase has increased. And so even projects that have had same design teams, same owner, same ed specs and design guidelines, those have gone up significantly over the last three years. The pandemic and look for anyone to jump in here has really exacerbated that. So it's been a very challenging number of years and the current market is very volatile. Just a couple of examples we had just by happenstance, a professional cost estimator in the other day, a cobit firm who was giving a presentation and they referenced, they worked on two libraries in central Oregon, same design team, same owner, same specs completed in the same timeframe and they were 30% different cost per square foot. So going out to market is very volatile when you actually get your bid. So I think that's something that we're seeing and I would, I'd be curious, Brad, if there's any like thoughts about like what you're seeing in the market out there today with your other projects that are non PPF projects?

start time: 315:52:10.000
end time: 318:31:56.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Well, yeah, the, the escalation allowances within this estimate that they are enormous.

start time: 318:33:48.000
end time: 318:39:08.000
confidence: 0.88
D: Right.

start time: 318:40:04.000
end time: 327:52:04.000
confidence: 0.94
F: And they are a bit of a crystal ball and you know we see the best data available in forecasting forward. But you know, escalation to November of 2025 that we're carrying is 13% as a point of perspective and you know these are cumulative. So we're adding on to the cost of work, $34 million there, then escalation to midpoint of construction or August 2027. We're placing that as a, as an estimate at 9%.

start time: 327:54:52.000
end time: 328:01:08.000
confidence: 0.89
D: Right.

start time: 328:02:04.000
end time: 329:16:04.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So that's another $23 million. So these are staggering numbers.

start time: 329:18:12.000
end time: 329:29:20.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Right.

start time: 329:37:00.000
end time: 332:32:00.000
confidence: 0.91
F: And. But they're prudent based on the experience and the general ongoing trend of inflation in the construction industry.

start time: 333:25:10.000
end time: 341:04:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: One of the things we did after the 2017 bond was. I'm just going to keep going until you jump in. After the 2017 bond was we changed the charter of the Bond Accountability Committee to have them take a look at projects. And I'm wondering if this new project scope and the estimations will go through the Bond Accountability Committee.

start time: 341:06:40.000
end time: 352:27:36.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Yeah, we had BC meeting weeks ago and just talked because we have some new, some new members about their involvement in this process. And so one of the things we talked about playing tonight, I think we're getting close enough to a package that we're not making a lot of changes. So we can take what are our cost estimating methodology to the bond and calibrated committee. We'll meet a number of times over the next couple months to say, you know, do they agree that our methodology is logical, is consistent and they can opine on that? So we could see some changes in the numbers. You will see changes in numbers over the next several months. But the BAC will be presented what our methodology is and have an opportunity.

start time: 352:28:08.000
end time: 352:51:00.000

D: To write on it.

start time: 353:01:20.000
end time: 355:07:40.000
confidence: 0.94
I: But to be clear, they do not review our cost estimates by project. They weigh in on our estimating methodology.

start time: 355:09:00.000
end time: 356:11:56.000
confidence: 0.93
B: For futures, which was the issue from 2018.

start time: 356:14:28.000
end time: 358:49:20.000
confidence: 0.94
I: Yes. And I just want to note too, we do have one of our BAC members here today, so I'm sure he's happy to answer questions from the BAC's perspective.

start time: 360:24:20.000
end time: 368:21:00.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So I should, I should have started by saying I appreciate the redesign. I think it's responsive to what the community issues that were raised. The price tag is really. So I'm just sort of trying to think through that piece of it. But I think from a design perspective, it's responsive to both the ED specs and also the community concerns that were raised.

start time: 368:41:20.000
end time: 385:10:50.000
confidence: 0.91
E: And I don't know, Marina might have a better recall like we've done over the years with Benson. It was probably for that, a lot of analysis of comparison to other like projects we've done specific analysis on like, specific trades like, like our framing and drywalls are quote, similar to other similar like projects we've done back a number of years. And I think help me out a little that just come back and said, yes, this is reasonable compared, you know, to what you're doing to pretty much or do other like projects and what that environment is. But what We've seen. I was looking at one of the pressure cost estimates. We use one of the big ones, Ryder Levitt Bucknell, who's got an office here, they put out these quarterly reports and Portland has been in the last three to four years alone, I didn't go back too far. Has been one of the hottest markets in the entire nation. And they average total escalation like 7 to 10% each of the last 10 years. And you're compounding that your prices go up dramatically in a relatively short period of time.

start time: 385:37:20.000
end time: 400:07:00.000
confidence: 0.93
I: We did. Do you probably recall from the 2017 conversations we did significant amount of cost research through different methodologies to try to see if we could sort of hone in on where we fit within the spectrum of costs across the country and also within our local area. We tried several different ways of coming at it and generally where we got to ultimately was in line with what you would expect for our ad specs and the market that we have here. We did have Ryder Levitt Bucknell RLB do an analysis as well. They essentially came to the same conclusions. Ultimately the cost is what the market tells us the cost is going to be.

start time: 400:43:00.000
end time: 406:06:52.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I just have two questions. So I'm a little confused because when it was originally talked about the demolishing of the 1909 building, it was supposed to be actually less expensive to demolish it then rebuild. Now we're hearing that it would have.

start time: 406:07:16.000
end time: 406:28:12.000
confidence: 1.00
D: Been cheaper to keep it.

start time: 406:29:56.000
end time: 407:49:50.000
confidence: 0.92
A: And so I'm just, I'm confused with that. With that scenario.

start time: 408:54:10.000
end time: 431:05:20.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Yeah, I mean I think Brad's touched on it a bit. I think the part of the aspect is whether we have an occupied or non occupied site. I think that makes a big difference in terms of it being a more complex, if it's occupied as more complex multi phase construction. There's just, you know, maintaining kind of that safe environment has a lot of implications in terms of how you do the work. So I think that's a component too. It's, I think as Brad said too the counterintuitively, from my perspective, you'd think that all the work you have to do on the 1909 to essentially retrofit and turn it into a seismically upgraded building would essentially kind of make it, you know, much less cost competitive. But the truth is like the, the fact that we had a building envelope, we had the basic essential structure, it's a wood timber frame building. If we're getting rid of that completely, we're essentially starting from scratch. So it, it ends up being. And with all of the again that resilience and climate policy requirements, you know, all of that to bring it up to that level kind of compounds the cost. But I don't know Brad.

start time: 431:24:20.000
end time: 435:39:08.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Yeah, here Hollins, I've asked that question repeatedly and from different directions to our estimating team and there's a couple points that they keep reminding me. You know the demolition of a four story brick building is costly.

confidence: 0.97
D: Right.

start time: 435:57:40.000
end time: 441:36:24.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Over $4 million to just simply take it down plus all the internal abatement, you know, the hazardous materials. So there are certain costs that we don't have. Should we say the structure. And we're getting the, the basic structure, floor plates and facade is existing.

confidence: 0.99
B: Right.

start time: 441:45:04.000
end time: 447:07:50.000
confidence: 0.95
F: And that's something we're not having to build to current modern standards. And so the cream. The, the cost associated with that upgrade becomes that the cost differential is purely the structural upgrade of that shell of that 1909. I don't know if that helps.

end time: 455:20:34.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Can I ask related to that though? But I mean are we the right comparison here? If we were to make sure I'm getting this right, remove the kids to another site but then demolish that then, then this original cost would have been cheaper I think. Gary, is that what you're. I feel like that's what people said at the time that you know, I.

start time: 455:20:42.000
end time: 457:13:10.000

end time: 458:52:30.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Oh but that's the. I mean that's this 366 million assume that they were off site.

start time: 459:00:10.000
end time: 459:52:18.000
confidence: 0.93
I: The only way we could get to 366 was to move them off site.

end time: 460:00:02.000
confidence: 0.75
D: Right.

start time: 460:01:46.000
end time: 461:11:30.000

I: That was why to not moving them off site.

start time: 461:41:50.000
end time: 467:17:26.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Right. Maybe my question wasn't maybe I didn't ask it. Right. I was just trying to think because Gary, I hear what you. I mean I had the same sort of thought but I think it's. It's not a comparison between this and it's a comparison of have we moved them off site. There were other things we could have done that would have. This would have been even the 366 would have been even lower potentially.

start time: 467:19:18.000
end time: 467:23:50.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Right.

start time: 467:24:30.000
end time: 468:00:52.000
confidence: 0.97
D: But we had sort of made it.

start time: 468:01:16.000
end time: 469:55:48.000
confidence: 0.83
I: Wouldn'T have made it lower. We were above 366 by none.

start time: 469:56:04.000
end time: 469:59:00.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Right.

start time: 469:59:40.000
end time: 472:19:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: But the 366 maintained the original facade. Had that not been a requirement of the original plan, would that have been less expensive?

start time: 472:49:00.000
end time: 490:59:50.000
confidence: 0.96
I: It's really hard to say at this point. Because we're now we'd have to essentially be backing up several years to when we first made decisions about whether we go for new construction or sort of the understandings that we're placed. The factor of time cannot be overlooked. The amount of time we continue to spend while we talk about doing something different increases the cost. When we get to a solution and the solution is not appropriate and we have to go back and find a different solution that adds time, time adds cost. I don't want us to overlook the fact that regardless of whether it's new construction or existing building, we have added time to this process and time means money. So there we could go back to the last solution and it would still be more expensive than it was when we came to you six months ago.

start time: 492:03:30.000
end time: 495:09:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Okay, next question I have. If the additional 124 million that's not approved, what are the trade offs? What do we lose or what do we not get?

start time: 496:30:10.000
end time: 499:37:10.000
confidence: 0.98
I: The only way to stay within 366 at this point would be to remove scope and it would be a significant amount of scope.

start time: 500:32:10.000
end time: 503:43:50.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Next question. This will be my last question. With the significant changes in scope that we've done from the beginning piece, would it be in the best interest of the district and our taxpayers to send it out to rebid?

start time: 505:21:10.000
end time: 511:20:46.000
confidence: 0.95
I: First of all, I just want to qualify that. We have not made significant changes in scope. What we have changed is method. So we have not changed the program. We are still putting all the same things into the school. What we've changed is how we are building it. So and the location on the site.

start time: 511:21:58.000
end time: 511:56:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: But demolishing the whole building is not a change.

start time: 511:58:30.000
end time: 535:00:30.000
confidence: 0.96
I: It doesn't change what we. It doesn't change what's going to be in the new school in terms of what program is there, the types of things that are going to be there, the amount of space that's going to be there, all of that is the same. The difference is how it is. We're getting to that point. So either we're starting with new construction or we're starting with existing. But at the end it'll still be a full head spec. Plus the things that we said we were going to. So just to clarify that when I say change in scope, I mean we will reduce the program to less square footage, less of the things that you want to have in an aspect. So clarifying that with scope, does that change if we go out to as you say, a rebid? We are in a CMGC at this point. We do have an option to end the contract. We could at that point, choose to move forward with another cmgc. We could also choose to move forward with a low bid process and put it out to bid as, as it's commonly known. All of those things are options. Would that change the cost? It could. It might not. Again, that's, you know, the challenge between estimating and what the market will give you. Right. We can estimate all we want and the market will give us what the market gives us.

end time: 560:15:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Just really quick. So I don't want to oversimplify it, but I mean, essentially the additional $124 million, and I do agree with director, you know, it's good just from a point perspective to kind of be able to say like, you know, this much is escalation, this much is demolition. I think that's helpful. But that really is a result of sort of hearing from the community. They don't want to move off site, taking the time to go back, come up with a plan that doesn't move folks off site. And then there are additional, both hard costs involved with that and then the escalation of the time. But I mean, is it oversimplifying to say that this is the difference of listening to community to figure out what it is? And if we were, and I'm not suggesting that I'm pushing this, but if we were to say, you know what, after looking at this, that's just too much. And to go back to sort of the original plan, to your point, Marina, that 366 is higher purely because of escalation with these inflation. You know, the last thing I'll say, this is not for staff. This is more for the committee, which I'm not on.

start time: 561:21:48.000
end time: 576:38:46.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Well, the only thing I would say is that, you know, this is. And again, I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to suggest something that takes a lot more time and continues to escalate cost. But I do wonder from a community perspective, I completely understand where the community came from. Right. And their desire to keep their kids on campus. I do wonder if the conversation would be different if we said, you know what, $124 million is too much. But you know what? We'd be willing to put $50 million more into the original plan to bring some extra bells and whistles to this high school and sort of, I guess it's just, it's. The community made a plea without knowing. None of us did. Right. What the Delta is going to be. Now that we know the Delta it just the decision for the board is going to be one of you know, essentially do we move, you know, forward with this or, or do we go back all the caveats of interests of what that entails? Yeah, I'll just sort of throw that out there.

end time: 592:12:00.000
confidence: 0.94
I: So we did not assume that this needed a vote for approval because we have not changed the ED spec. We're still meeting all of the same requirements of the aspect typically the approval of the comprehensive plan. We only come back for another vote if we make significant changes to the program that's going to be completed and we're not making significant changes to that scope. The scope is the same again if the method has changed. So we didn't anticipate that it was a vote per se. It is a presentation and obviously if we hear from the board that there are challenges with it then we'll know that we're not moving forward.

start time: 592:26:20.000
end time: 594:26:28.000
confidence: 0.95

start time: 596:28:20.000
end time: 598:46:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Right. And I guess that wasn't in here. So, so the increase if you know again we move forward would be funded out of the next bond.

confidence: 0.96
B: I'll just say I, I think we need to be like the 124 needs to be broken down and much more because I don't think we can say unless we're really have a more precise set of numbers that well it's because we're following the climate policy. I mean is that 20 million, I mean so I think we have to be much more precise about where, how the numbers shift because we need to be able to talk about it. I mean it's, we've got 480 students at Jefferson now. I mean that's what the school report showed. I just think we're going to need to be able to show where that is. And then the other piece, the seismic upgrades, I mean that's a real value. There's a real value to the building and the community to have a. Is it, I don't know what the rating, whatever it is that the much higher rating. So like what. How much does that cost? And I think that's. We've said we want to Build some of our buildings. That rating says more to be also community resilient, for community resiliency. But I don't think we just like, well, it's just 124 million more. Just we need to be able to specify how we got to that number from my perspective.

Use your chest voice, whatever it's called. Kidding aside. Yeah, I just want to second what, what Bryn Edwards said. It would be nice to see that breakdown. And I guess just a really quick question again, the sound was cutting in and out, so this might have been answered and I totally missed it.

But anyways, I'll be curious to explore this more. So thank you.

And essentially we have two schemes. We'd love to hear your opinion on which one you think should be coming to the board in May for the, the final recommendation. So I'm going to turn it over to Donna to introduce yourself and walk you through the presentation.

end time: 780:35:22.000
confidence: 0.97
H: Thank you. We'll be looking at two schemes today, but I want to start with an overview of the IWL site as you've seen before. Just showing this to familiarize you once again and summarize the major elements and constraints on the site. The school will remain operational during construction. The pool remains in its current location. The largest elements at play are the track and field, the baseball field and the multi use field field on the western half of the site. The existing southwest trails are indicated by the red dashed line. We'll be improving those and integrating them into our campus approach as part of this work. After we review the two schemes today, we are asking for your recommendation to narrow these down to one scheme to bring to the full board on May 7. We will look at each scheme a little closer than this, but let's look at the main differences first. You've seen these two. You've seen two schemes similar to these before where we've been looking at placing the new high school in the southern, the south central part of the property. The main difference here is keeping the track and field in its current location or rotating it to a north south orientation at the west end of the site. In scheme two, if the track, field and grandstands remain where they are as in Scheme 1, they will receive full upgrades, including complete remodel of the restrooms, seismic and ADA upgrades, and other measures to improve the look and feel of the grandstands as you see them from the street. In Scheme 2, many people have expressed the opinion that they would like a more direct connection to the school and to the school property from Capitol highway and the city bus stops. And some would like to have the grandstands removed as they can present a visual and physical barrier for the approach to the school, sometimes described as dark and uninviting. If we move the field in grandstands, we will lose approximately 500 seats when we build new stands to the ED spec, which is for 1700 seats. Currently we have 2100 to almost 2200 seats. Currently those concrete stands have approximately 2200 seats, though we've been told they are rarely if ever filled in either scheme. We are not planning for visitor seating as those are not part of the typical high schools and education specifications. There are considerations for keeping the concrete stands that would be a more sustainable choice. Neither seating nor sustainability seem to be a large factor in our CPC and community meetings. It was noted more often to remove the stands as they are seen as a potential issue when laying out the entire site and providing the best access to the new building. It has been stated that improving the orientation of the track is much better for reduced sun glare for players and all sports that use the field. We are still studying if complaints about wind can be improved. Looking at scheme one a little closer here, the scheme provides the opportunity for a pathway from the elementary school over here and from the softball fields to the building in central campus. Whereas if you had the track and field oriented on this end you would not have that access there. Total parking counts for both schemes are about the same. The majority of the parking is on the south near the main entry to the school. In both schemes, this scheme provides the option for a drive around the east side of campus here around the baseball field, and there's been split opinions about this driveway connecting the two parking lots. It could have gates at either end. There is an existing drive along that side of the campus right now that has parking on both sides, sides double loaded. On this side of campus, this option would only be a driveway. There is no parking provided along that route. In scheme two, you'll see there's only a pedestrian path on this edge because a road does not fit all the way around. Some people prefer prefer that route should only be for pedestrians. Others see this drive as a good option to keep extra traffic away from Burlingame Avenue or through the Ricky parking lot, which have been noted as past problems. However, speeding through the current site has also been an issue in both schemes. I'd like to note that the building orientation and massing for the building allows for maximum daylighting and minimizes western sun exposure, reducing building energy consumption and eliminating solar discomfort. Teachers have reported glare from the south facing windows as well and that too will be considered in the building design. Again, both schemes provide pathways through campus to connect to the Southwest Trails network and the broader business and residential district, making the school a beacon of activity in Southwest Portland. Building massing is optimal for a timber structure, allowing for reduced embodied carbon emissions, improved indoor air quality and wood provides a warm, inviting feeling. The central commons in both schemes act as a heart of the building and the campus and the commons connect to outdoor plazas, creating a variety of spaces for gathering and community connection. Site configuration allows for universal accessibility, going beyond code to create A physical space of inclusion at every scale. Here we have a view from Capitol highway where people would approach from the city bus stops and you can see where the grandstands are there and how the field is somewhat raised with the fence around it. So you would need to walk around the field as you currently do to get to the school. Looking at Scheme two, if we move the track and field, that allows for direct invisible connection to and from Capitol Highway. With these paths here, optimal north south orientation for the track and field for sun. Although the grandstands do face west, facing the stands would be more preferable to the east. But placing the stands on the hillside and near the school are the best solutions.

C: Here.

end time: 797:14:14.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Again, both schemes provide for maximum daylighting, the connections to southwest trails, opportunity for timber structure, central commons and connections to outdoor plazas and universal accessibility. If we were to move the grandstands, this is the view of Scheme 2. From that Capitol highway approach, you can see where there'd be a direct path towards the building. Here we have a cost estimate summary. The baseline cost is 425 million to 435 million. This assumes a2028 building opening date 2029 project completion. However, that is a very tight schedule, not likely. If pushed back a year, there will be approximately 12 million to 15 million in additional costs from escalation. The difference from Scheme 1 to Scheme 2 is in the site costs.

end time: 821:33:50.000
confidence: 0.97
H: Again, keeping that track and field in the existing location provides improvements for less track and field disruption during construction, more seating at the grandstands and a lower site cost. Just to summarize some of the comments we've been receiving from the Comprehensive Planning Committee and the Steering Committee, those supporting Scheme one felt the distance to walk from buses to the entrance is about the same and the grandstands may not be as intrusive as others have felt. Some people, including some in the Bond Accountability Committee felt cost isn't that great when looking at the larger picture and the percentage to the total cost, while others feel those funds are a greater factor and could be used for other programs. Those supporting Scheme 2 focused on the access to Capitol highway as a primary entrance. The sun on the field can be a safety issue as players cannot see into the sun. People noted that they liked the pairing of the baseball and multi purpose fields, moving the tennis away from the residences that are on the east edge of the property. We should also note that we're still some geological information with technical survey and drilling happening in the next two weeks to gather more definitive information. There are concerns about groundwater on this site and that still needs further study at this point. We'd like your thoughts and recommendations on which direction to move forward. Thank you.

B: Yeah, well I guess I'm thinking like because right now I'd be like, you know, we should go with the one that makes the most has the community support because they're not that much difference. But I'm just wondering are there factors that would be. When we get to X stage we could get a diverge. More of a divergence of the numbers. Does that make sense?

B: And then my last question is in both of these, the decisions we made around the pool last time are incorporated in here, which is keep it where it is. It's the summertime place where Andrew and the neighborhood kids get to go.

end time: 872:06:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I mean it's amazing. So like either one of these is like, wow, this is great. I hate to buy into at certain point like I go with this one but if it has a much higher risk, again just want to be cost sensitive so that would be a concern. But in general, I think both of them are going to be beautiful assets for the students in Southwest Portland.

B: It's Scheme two is the one where the field moves. No. Yeah, Scheme two is the one where the field moves. So this like to me that's not a huge differential, but it's like there's some risk and so it could.

D: Well, I gave my thoughts as part of the CPC process, but I'll share them since you asked. I think they're both really good actually I'm going to say a lot of same things Director Boom Edwards did. I think they both work really well. My preference is for Scheme two because I just visually like the orientation a little bit better. I think having the field north and south would be better. I think your point is great about certain additional risk and I assume as we get to geotechnical there's opportunity to still pivot, you know, and come back as things, you know, happen, you know. The CPC had a Preference for Scheme 2, but there were a number of people in the community who also preferred Scheme one for different reasons. So the pool was really interesting at this last meeting. You know, we had met in this committee and decided to sort of keep it where it was mainly because we don't want to take it over because of the operating costs which are significant there. There were some members, one in particular who was very angry at our decision not to just demolish the pool. He wanted to get rid of it completely. And that was followed very shortly by another member who wanted to keep the pool where it was, but cover it, close it, heat it, make it our asset and make it a year round asset for the school and the community. And then a third member who looked at the first member and said there's no way we're getting rid of this pool, but the local community depends on the business community depends on in the summertime. So just within a span of 10 minutes we heard from three very different perspectives on the pool, which I thought was interesting. And then again I think the different perspectives we heard most of the people, I think the majority staff, correct me if I'm wrong, preferred the reorientation but there were some parents who said where it is right now, we'll lose the field if we reorient. And so they were concerned about losing it for two, two years, three years, you know, and, and, but, but then, you know, and I don't know Gary. You know about this better than I. You know I think some people were saying the north south the east west orientation is really difficult for athletes versus.

A: A couple times I would say is just. Just sitting here listening to that we lose the track for three years. It doesn't sound like a big group. Big deal. The people in here we just lived it and it was a. A show. I'll just say that. Right. And knowing that we're about to lose another fail for four years and if it's $8 million and we're not sure of what what might end up being. I don't personally as we looked at talk my team we don't feel like moving to east north south is a better option than staying the way we are. I guess that's as simple as that. I just think option one just seems a better option for us. Especially knowing that in my experience of value engineering and there's gonna be some other stuff that's gonna be coming out and the fact that this is the only site that we might actually have a full high school athletic facility. I'd hate to do something and then end up losing something else that we have as a result. I also like the I think in the scheme one I think the tennis courts were on the on the top northwest in the corner scheme went over there. I thought that that is a parking and was a better model than than than than than two and get but I've worked there five years four years lived on both sides. So I scheme one for the cost. The $8 billion to me is a big deal. Especially when I just heard we're might be spending up to 435 million. That's really probably like 490 million. That's what I heard from the other school with escalation that those. Those are big dollars to me in terms of what might happen. So we chose option one. But clearly we'll live with either just because it's the only footprint we have that has full athletics. Thank you. All right. Hey, Eddie.

E: Yeah, it's just quick question. Well, actually one comment in scheme 2 looks like your audience will be facing the sun during games though with the grandstand pointing that way. I was just curious just a quick question about you meant forgot who was presenting mention something to do with the sun and the heating cooling Preference over Scheme 1. I was wondering if you could expand on that like how much of a difference that would be in terms of energy savings.

start time: 983:32:10.000
end time: 986:26:10.000
confidence: 0.95
H: As a difference between the two or really both schemes address those issues and I would probably throw that to Steffi with Bora is here and could maybe answer that a little better.

start time: 986:36:30.000
end time: 1002:06:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Both. Both Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 buildings try to make sure that classrooms are not facing east or west, which is the sun that is really hard to control and creates a lot of glare. They both try to make sure that all the classrooms are facing north and south. You can see the Scheme 2 has a little piece that goes up, that's the gym piece in this scheme, which tends to have windows that can be can control the light. Both of them though would be pretty much the same in terms of their heating and cooling loads. Scheme two is a little bit more compact and a little bit taller and has by that it has a little bit less building enclosure skin. But I mean it's kind of negligible at this level of design. They'll both be designed to be as energy efficient as we can make them in a reasonable way.

I can't tell if the parking is different, but it looks like the parking move from the around the side to now you have the more more spots in the front of the building. Is that true?

C: Hi, my name is Jasmine Reese and I'm also a member of the CPC and I'm a parent of children in elementary school who will potentially attend Wells. I have a second grader at Bridal Mile elementary and a kindergartner at Bridal Mile Elementary. And as a member of the cpc, we asked a lot of questions. There are, you know, a Good representation of people, people from the community on the cpc. And we asked questions specifically about the pool. And after reviewing the last facilities and operations meeting, we understood and we heard that there was no data presented from the community on what they wanted for the pool. And so members of the CPC took it upon themselves to public records request the deeds and ordinances in the IGA is related to the pool to discuss what exactly the process is. Because we kept being informed that it's a legal issue. It's a legal issue. We can't do anything with the pool. What we determined was exactly what Marina had presented at the last F and O is that the pool is owned by the city. It could be terminated within 120 days by. With 120 days notice. And so we still questioned why the pool is not being considered in the total site redesign given the. Given the topography of the site and the elevation of the pool and the other questions of the geotechnical report, that is outstanding. So being a member of many moms groups, parent groups, pta, a business owner in Multnomah Village in Hillsdale, I submitted out a survey on social media, sent it to attorneys who. Whose kids go to wells, and that was on Friday. And as of today, we got 60 respondents. And only one person out of the 60 said that they did not want the pool there. Everyone said positively they do want the pool and they do want it to be incorporated in the bond project and to be renovated with the site. So our question as a whole is, is there an opportunity before the DAG process is initiated to consult with Walton Hills Parks and Recreation District on maintenance costs for an outdoor pool like the Raleigh park or Sunset Swim center or cost of enclosed pools? What the maintenance cost is real today. Dollars.

D: One of the questions that came up that some members of the CDC raised was are we creating a situation where we're building a brand new facility all around a pool which is 50 years old? Does that create a situation 20 years from now, 30 years from now, when the pool is failing? Because I don't think we can expect to do much more than basic maintenance that again, maybe the pool goes out of service and we're facing a similar situation where we Faced like the grant. And I think if I'm right, the response from staff was, you know, that's certainly a possibility. But it's also given where it's located, you know, not to say we would have funding to fix it, but you know, it is fixable. It's not like it would shut down, you know, the campus. Is that, am I accurately representing.

confidence: 0.96
D: I mean, I'll just say Jasmine and I talked at the meeting. I mean I, I completely agree that if funding were not an issue, I think turning this pool into a year round asset would be great. And I am honestly what was compelling for me, if we could add a few million bucks to do that in the bond, I might be pushing for it. What was compelling to me was the operating costs. And I wish I did remember what they were, but I remember they were significant enough. When we're facing $30 million of cuts this year in our school budget and more next year. It's very hard for me to look at the community and say cutting all these things that are super important course central services. But I'm supporting a project that is going to eat into the operating budget in the future. And that's a really hard decision because I think the point is really well made and really well taken. And I guess what I would say is I think it also is the kind of thing we could do five or 10 years from now, you know, both in terms of a future bond or you know, if the state actually comes through with, you know, different levels of funding. It's something that we, you know, we're not cutting off the option to do that.

So it's like an. I'm fine with two as long as all of a sudden we don't get a. Oh, we went in and there's a whole host of much bigger issues that's going to cost us a lot more money.

E: You know, I'm a little bit torn between the two. I could go either way. I. I'm sorry, I'm not being helpful. I mean, I. I see the benefits of one, but I mean, honestly, the. The pluses and minuses for both are equally compelling. So I'm sorry, I. No opinion on this end.

confidence: 0.96
B: Is there any way. I mean, I'm good with you. Is there any way, though, we could find out more information early and earlier in the process versus later in the process about soil stability or whatever? The issue is that we do a little due diligence at the front end.

start time: 1164:45:39.000
end time: 1167:37:59.000
confidence: 0.99
I: We are moving forward with our due diligence. It's just that the reality is that we cannot. We cannot move forward designing both options at the same time.

E: This slide somehow didn't get in the presentation. It was there, I think when it got converted PDF, but it's just a quick summary of. This is our. Our third meeting talking about bond planning. We've reviewed a lot of material, lots of different options. Some of the primary takeaways you can see there that staff took from our previous conversations. We're pursuing a larger principal bond amount, continuing to prioritize modernizations, allocating significant funds to address existing facility conditions, proceeding with technology improvements, and importantly retaining the existing levy rate, amongst others. Those are some of the big ones. You have a sample office. You've got lots of materials tonight. You have the staff memo, you've got the presentation, you've got a couple of other memos regarding device refresh and curriculum. And you also have a levy rate analysis from our financial advisors, Piper Sandler. We have two folks with us tonight to answer questions. And then this same conceptual bond budget sample option type document that we've used before. So the. The far right column is the updated sample option based upon feedback based upon updated numbers. So when you look at that document, you'll see it's a big principal amount, over $2.2 billion. And it includes lots of very impactful work modernizations, such as Jefferson with the updated number of wells, Cleveland Tubman, and the K5 Learning Lab as well as funds for different maintenance for technology, covered play structures and athletic improvements. It's also worth noting it does not include some pretty significant scopes of work as well, such as seismic improvements, ADA security upgrades, some educational improvements and capacity. I want to call out does it include any funds for capacity? We consider capacity whether new capacity or supporting shifts of enrollment. I want a specific call here. I didn't change the slide but because it was already posted. But Roosevelt phase five, something that we are planning. Roosevelt has had four phases. It is not doesn't have a full 1700 capacity. That is not in the sample option. Something that I think we've hit on briefly previously not in detail but I want to call it out here. We've got a bunch of staff here tonight who can answer questions about different scopes of work. We have Jenny Witheca who I think is online if we want to talk about PE and the covered play structures. Marshall of course is here. Our senior director of Security and Emergency Management Services, Molly Rome is here. We've got two folks, Lauren and David from Piper Sandler, Joanne and Marcus could talk about curriculum. I know there were some discussions about curriculum. Don is here as well. We also have Heidi Berkman who is our senior program manager who was our one time capital planner which is one of her duties amongst many other duties that she has. She's a wealth of knowledge. So if you have questions we can take some now or we can continue to move on and ask them at the end. If you have specific scope questions, just some quick pros and cons of the sample option. I won't go through all of these. You can see the the option that before you continues the long standing modernization plan does include significant funds for other scopes of work and retains the existing levy. Great. Some of the cons is some of the scope that it does include that others may be interested in having that in a future ball. We may hear feedback from community members. A lot of the scope is scope specific work like modernizations that means they need to be completed in full to be considered. You know completing what we are asking the voters to vote for. That adds risk. If you have a lot of defined scope that you have to have the right amount of money to complete that work. It's huge. 2.2 billion is by far the largest bond in the state. We have right now probably about 700 or $1 million. We are projecting we'll have about $600 million left in the 2020 bond by the end of this year. So that's almost $3 billion. We would go into 2025 with that's going to take a long time to. And that keeping the levy rate is going to have a long term debt structure. So the total interest is going to be pretty high most likely. Piper, we haven't done updated analysis on this number but letting great analysis but probably interest north of a billion dollars. And as we talked about before a future next bond would either likely be a decade or plus in the future and or include a levy rate increase. This I'm just calling out to one of the goals of tonight is to really kind of confirm do we have about the right scope of work? Because we want to move into further refinement of the scope, further refinement of the estimates and also putting together some potential schedules of how we sequence this work. We, we can't do it all at once. So it's going to take this level of work. It's going to take many years to do and we just want to be cognizant of that and show how we might sequence that work. I mean to kind of put it plainly, some of these projects won't even start for a decade and some of this work won't be done for well after a decade. So we want to start showing with the scope of work what that might look like to get the board's feedback. This is what I alluded to earlier about cost management. Construction cost estimating has been. I'll repeat it but has been a significant challenge in recent years. The current market is very volatile. The one other example I threw up there was. This is just an, you know, an article that I saw in the, in the djc. Multnomah County's new library over on the east side is $147 million and it's less than a hundred thousand square feet. So it's not even a third the size of what Jefferson is or what most of our high schools are. You know that's over 100 a square foot.

start time: 1307:10:58.000
end time: 1311:26:04.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Can I offer just like maybe one reason why that's over is that TriMet required them to put in underground parking which is super expensive. Just as a additional factor around that library.

start time: 1311:29:22.000
end time: 1328:35:10.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Sure. Yeah. I'm certainly not want to say it's a total apples to apples, just more of a cost or it's. It's a challenging cost market. Yep. So our next steps after tonight is we want to continue our scope, refinement and costs. A couple of areas that we want to get more detail on we'll present is athletics and curriculum amongst others. But those are two that we introduced to the sample option last time. We've provided some initial information. We're going to further refine that. We talked about program schedules and cash flows we'll be bringing forward. We'll update our levy rate analysis as well. Looking to kick off some more community feedback. And then the BAC as we talked about before, meeting with them soon. The next meeting that we have is a facilitate operation committee, April 17 with spring break coming up. That's really just a few weeks away with the past. Questions, concerns, comments?

start time: 1329:08:10.000
end time: 1331:09:38.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Gary? Yeah, can I just make a couple comments because I'm walking to a 6:00 meeting if.

start time: 1331:11:54.000
end time: 1331:35:10.000
confidence: 0.75
A: Okay, go ahead.

start time: 1331:53:30.000
end time: 1358:21:40.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So a couple things. Thank you for the additional refinements. It's very helpful. I'm still all in on completing our high schools. I want to just lay that down. I think there's a different way to present the ADA and the seismic because and this is I'm going to go back to the when we had the 2017 bond conversations is anytime we do a modernization, we're putting millions of dollars into seismic upgrades and ADA improvements. And it so it shouldn't be presented as like we're not doing anything. So that's more of like a formatting because I think it will lead people to believe like we're not doing anything. It's like actually we're doing a lot. The other thing is I would like to hear from Indian Ed and the Native American Staff Advisory Council on the Native center for Native Student Excellence at another meeting or separately because I don't think we've had an opportunity to talk about that. And especially if we're looking at not going out for another bond in a while. I want to make sure that we have a full discussion for this one. But otherwise I really appreciate the sort of continuing to refine the work. And if I have questions on the it, which I did last time, I will send them to Dan and Don.

confidence: 0.95
D: I want to make sure at sort of a high level that I. I'm looking at the right things, Dan. But you know our new Bond conceptual budget, 2.2 billion but the financing stuff is still showing at 1.8.

start time: 1362:55:44.000
end time: 1363:02:16.000
confidence: 0.81
A: Correct.

start time: 1363:02:48.000
end time: 1365:59:00.000
confidence: 0.90
E: So we we haven't had an opportunity to ask Hyper to update based upon this new number we had. And I apologize a lot of the materials came in late. Lots of numbers changing coming in late. But we will have that for next time.

start time: 1365:59:40.000
end time: 1366:02:28.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Okay.

start time: 1366:02:44.000
end time: 1369:07:48.000
confidence: 0.86
D: You'll have it for next. And do. Okay. And that's gonna Again, probably push out the like longer financing, higher interest rate costs. Did you say my first year?

start time: 1369:08:44.000
end time: 1369:59:48.000
confidence: 0.91
E: Tonight, virtually we have both David and Lauren. Okay.

start time: 1370:01:24.000
end time: 1379:34:44.000
confidence: 0.95
D: You know, and I guess maybe if we're gonna get new numbers, we don't need to spend too much time on it. But I was to do is make sure when looking at sort of the 1.8 billion. And again, the goal here which we gave you is to keep it at 2,250in terms of a levy rate. The, you know, the first option with, with 28 year issue obviously has very expensive interest because you know, again, it's a 28 year. So it's like, like a home mortgage.

start time: 1379:35:32.000
end time: 1379:38:12.000
confidence: 0.91
G: Right.

start time: 1379:38:36.000
end time: 1389:45:30.000
confidence: 0.94
D: You pay a ton of interest. It's like a $1.8 billion home mortgage and you pay a lot. But that allowed us to go out for another next bond. Again staying at the same tax rate at 2032 versus I think I'm going to get a question as I'm talking but versus, you know, a shorter issue of 16 years dramatically reduces the interest but extends by almost. No, actually 11 more years. It's almost 10. It's actually 11 more years before we go out again. And that's just because we got to pay that higher rate for longer in order to pay the debt offer.

start time: 1389:59:50.000
end time: 1391:12:30.000
confidence: 0.85
E: Yes. Right. Lauren or David, if you want to add any extra.

start time: 1391:13:50.000
end time: 1391:49:30.000
confidence: 0.85
D: That's kind of obvious. What I just wanted to say.

start time: 1392:42:30.000
end time: 1397:39:00.000
confidence: 0.93
E: One thing. I will add to that, I think with that levy drop. I don't know and I don't know. I think everyone knows is, I mean obviously it's pretty far out to project is. I think it's still possible that to go out and bond another bond at that time, you would still need an increase. It just wouldn't be as much of an increase.

start time: 1397:49:20.000
end time: 1406:48:50.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Okay. And do we need to decide, do we need to decide that? I mean if we were to settle on a 1.8 or maybe a new number is a 2.2. But the financing corporate question can actually be answered after a bond passes. Right. The bond gives us the authority to. To bond, borrow up to a certain amount and to le. Well, it's actually the levy is. It's just the amount to borrow up to a certain amount. But we could actually make that decision later. This is sort of a question.

E: Hearing you.

start time: 1414:39:50.000
end time: 1421:33:56.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Set up, but you do. Is this better? Yeah, you do have the chance to adjust the structure. Every time you issue a series of bonds, you will have a maximum term that's included in the ballot title. So you can go no longer than that. So obviously including a longer term is going to provide you with the most flexibility because you can always shorten series.

start time: 1421:35:08.000
end time: 1427:31:26.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Of bonds down and would we be able to, I'm just trying to remember refinancing rules. Would we be able to. I mean, it wouldn't be advisable, but never mind. I'm not even gonna ask that question, but thank you. You answered the question. Did you, did you get what she was saying? So essentially we, we've included a bond title, a long financing term and then.

start time: 1427:32:38.000
end time: 1427:57:34.000
confidence: 0.86
A: Kind of like paying your mortgage off early.

start time: 1427:59:02.000
end time: 1442:14:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Right. From a fiscal management perspective, we can sort of decide because I will tell you, I'm, I'm, I'm very concerned. Just, I mean, 28 year bonds are really long. For government bonds, people buy houses on 30 years. Governments generally, you know, it's advisable not to issue longer than 20. You can for assets that are going to last longer than 20 and these assets will last longer than 20 years. But just from a public financing perspective, it's advisable not to. So I'm really drawn towards the, you know, the shorter issue. And you know, I mean saving a billion dollars of interest is not a small map of interest. But I also want to be cognizant of the fact that, you know, we're putting on for 20 years issuing another bond. Although, Dan, to your point, it's going to take us without a tax increase, I should say without a tax. To your point, it's going to take us 10 to. What was your estimate on 10 to how many years?

start time: 1442:23:30.000
end time: 1444:35:32.000
confidence: 0.92
E: At 200 million a year, which we've been averaging for the last three or four years. I can't remember if that's about 14 years, so about so.

start time: 1444:35:56.000
end time: 1445:01:40.000
confidence: 0.98
D: But it's still 14 years to complete the work.

start time: 1445:02:20.000
end time: 1445:29:20.000
confidence: 0.83
E: To complete the work, yeah. Right.

start time: 1445:51:40.000
end time: 1450:44:04.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah. Okay, I have, let me see, just a couple other quick questions and maybe this is for Don. The ERP at $38 million, is that conceptual at this point? I know you're, you're, we don't have.

start time: 1450:44:12.000
end time: 1451:04:20.000
confidence: 1.00
E: A detailed budget at this point.

start time: 1451:05:00.000
end time: 1451:44:12.000
confidence: 0.99
D: We're working through the negotiations with the.

start time: 1451:44:36.000
end time: 1454:18:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Provider and the implementer for us right now. But there are some other elements that will need to go into this. What do we do with 20 years of data history and our old ERP.

start time: 1454:21:00.000
end time: 1457:05:48.000
confidence: 0.93
D: And building out the structure for that and or collection of data warehouse. So we're working on refining a specific budget but it's in alignment with what.

start time: 1457:06:44.000
end time: 1458:54:30.000
confidence: 1.00
E: That 10 year cost estimate is. The full tenure of the contract plus.

start time: 1458:55:50.000
end time: 1466:59:22.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Contingency for the other elements that we're going to have to put in place and knowing that we're going to have to back out into operational expense at some point. But you're in contract negotiations right now and then, and then I guess Dan, do we need to be prepared when the new financing comes back that we may not be able to get 2.2 million? I mean is that or at the current tax rate or we think we can. It's just a matter of how we, how we finance it on the back end.

start time: 1467:02:26.000
end time: 1470:17:50.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I believe that answer how we finance it. The question if you heard David or Lauren was do we think that we wouldn't be able to get 2.2 billion or is it just a financing configuration?

start time: 1470:58:10.000
end time: 1475:25:00.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Oh, I think you. I think we have the capacity to do 2.2 at the 250 levy rate. It's just going to be pushing out the timing of that issuance a little bit more.

start time: 1475:56:40.000
end time: 1477:50:08.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Okay, can you remind me what the pe, I know it's in your memo, I'm sorry but the pe, the $33 million there was for.

start time: 1477:52:24.000
end time: 1481:26:02.000

F: Ann, one important note on the original scenario where the max term was 28 years, I would agree that that is longer than we see in a lot of places. But I would note if you in the packet, if you look at the scenarios presented, you would find the graph on what IS R page 6 where this, this is a series of bonds stacked 28 years is the maximum tail on a little bit that drags through. Most of the series that are issued would be far less. If you issue them all at 28 years, your interest would not be 95%. Your total interest would be like, you know, 180% or something like that. It would be really explosive but most of the series would be far less than that. I mean I think you're looking in the teens for duration for a lot of those series it's just a little tail that kind of drags through to the duration.

A: I just have a few questions. When we talk about an ADA piece and we don't have anything for it or is any of the projects that we need to do, I mean that needs to be happening out of compliance at this time for ADA that we probably need to include.

start time: 1510:22:10.000
end time: 1525:18:54.000
confidence: 0.92
E: So I'll give a answer then I'll let Heidi correct me what I get wrong. So our schools now so what the 2020 model includes and Julia's 100 modernizations can do that as well is so this is there's a dedicated ADA funds to tackle the next phase of our ADA transition plan. The first phases is first floor access. So a lot of our sites do not have full access to upper floors don't have elevators. Architectural barriers is the term that we use. So to be for the district to be in ADA compliance if there is someone who needs to access an inaccessible area, we have to relocate in some form or another that gets us into compliance. But that is definitely not the situation we want to be in. Heidi, is that a fair oversimplification?

start time: 1525:21:02.000
end time: 1527:16:10.000
confidence: 0.93
C: That's exactly right. Our obligation under the federal legislation is to make our programs accessible. We already do that.

H: What the 2020 bond funding is doing.

start time: 1528:07:18.000
end time: 1535:39:56.000
confidence: 0.94
C: To make that easier is it is creating mean level accessibility across the district so that work is funded and underway and will be complete. Phases three and four identified in the ADA transition plan create basically an enhancement. It's multi level accessibility across the district. So then that lets us we look at our space planning for the district have our programs anywhere we don't have to adjust to make the program accessible.

A: Security too question about security. I mean there'll be a lot of these questions around some of the stuff that has zero. What are I guess my question is what would be what would we be could have been getting if we have added money to those. So for instance you're talking about security outdoor space by us moving money around. What are we missing out of those the things that we're not funding.

start time: 1545:44:00.000

E: Well I did want to make sure we highlighted security a little bit. So I'll let Molly talk. Potential scopes are and highlight the PAT component as well.

end time: 1563:45:44.000
confidence: 0.91
C: So we identified a number of potential security projects for the 2024. Thinking about our layered approach to security we identified sort of our boundary layer around making certain opportunity for fencing. We identified vestibules which is in our current standard and specs. Those are fairly costly and then some of the more lower hanging fruit and one of the things that was identified in the PAT contract around window coverings just to finish off our surveillance project that we're currently working on in the 2020 bond and then to upgrades our antiquated access control system to bring that up to current DOM can talk a.

C: So there's some larger projects and then there's also some. Some lower hanging projects. You know, the 2017 bond and the 2020 bond had a security component. So obviously we would advocate strongly to have to have a security component in the 2021.

end time: 1585:40:00.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I guess one of my things is that since it is a big a big bond, is there a way we could at least give something a little something for everyone? For instance, you know we talk about, you know, some of these ones that you identified that we're not going to be hitting. Is there a way we could add in some for those as well? And of course we have to take from somewhere else, but is there a way we could kind of even things out to. Not even things out but at everyone gets something instead of zero at all.

start time: 1585:50:20.000
end time: 1587:39:20.000
confidence: 0.89

start time: 1587:47:40.000
end time: 1593:34:32.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah, the category that you're showing here. So like when I look at like security, I don't know what the stuff costs, but if we added like 3 million or 5 million to that, would that help? Would that do something with some of these. Some of these other. Well, I'll just use that as an example.

start time: 1593:35:36.000
end time: 1601:11:50.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Yeah, I mean I think certainly again I think from like a security perspective, I think it goes a long way to voters and for to have a security component because that again, think about what's our priority to students and staff is safety. And so I think again I'll advocate right for our security to be part of this.

start time: 1601:52:50.000
end time: 1613:10:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I guess for me I would love to see what I mean I see the cost ranges and of course we're not going to be able to get all the cost ranges for everything. But I would love to see if we can get something for some of these other categories and what that looks like as well. The safety. I know for a lot of our kids we had the safety meeting that was one of their big things as far as feeling safe at schools and things we can do to feel safe at Schools and so I would just love to see if things can be done with some of these categories that we're not allocate anything for the 2024 bond. Eddie?

start time: 1646:25:30.000
end time: 1656:09:50.000
confidence: 0.95
E: And I'll give the initial response. So we took the list that Julia provided last time. Heidi Marshall and team got together to take a look at defining those scopes and providing a high level cost estimate of those scopes we're going to provide. Kind of next step is a more specific crosswalk to see which site is included in the estimate. What's that scope of work? Because I think there has been some movement there as well. So we just need A little more time to develop that. Okay, we'll get that out. I don't know if there's anything.

start time: 1656:46:10.000
end time: 1657:21:46.000
confidence: 0.82
A: I don't have any more questions to.

start time: 1657:22:58.000
end time: 1661:32:30.000
confidence: 0.91
E: Can I just propose real quick, I think one topic we haven't hit on is curriculum. And we have Trina Tobin and Marcus here. If you have any questions or if you want to provide any high level kind of. This is what we're looking at for curriculum.

start time: 1661:38:10.000
end time: 1661:51:22.000
confidence: 0.97
I: Yeah, sure.

start time: 1661:51:46.000
end time: 1693:09:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I mean, I think just really briefly, we're very appreciative of what the 2020 bond allowed for us to do to really come back into compliance with ODE's timelines for curriculum adoption. So what we're proposing and the high level conceptual numbers that we've provided to Dan and team really allow for us to maintain that seven year cycle in accordance with ODE's guidelines. So just really briefly stated, ODE puts out the standards and then the curriculum that they put forward for the Caribbean and for that, all the professional learning around that happens in that cycle. When we get off cycle, we miss out on those opportunities and we may not be in sync with the standards. Right. Which is central in our instructional framework. And so what we've proposed is. And Marcus had to leave, but he's really looked at, he's our adoptions manager and we really looked at. Now, based off of where we're at with the recent curriculum adoptions, how do we come in sync with OBE's timelines and not have these big balloon payments where we're doing multiple adoptions in a short amount of time? And so our ask is really to essentially provide funds within the bond to maintain one curriculum area annually, which is in compliance. And then also what we're currently really digging into in partnership with Don's team is our digital apps. Right now we have a substantial amount of digital apps that support our curriculum use. Some of those are no longer necessary and so we are removing those. We're getting a solid number for what we'll need moving forward. We're also looking at translations for our dual language programs and how that translation sits within the adoption cycle to get a really clear number. We're. It's all conceptual right now. We've provided that to Dan's team and certainly provide more information.

start time: 1693:39:30.000
end time: 1697:45:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Thank you. And so just as I make sure I'm as clear. So these are not necessarily new curriculum that we're getting. These are just mostly updates on a more systematic schedule to keep up with the whatever standards that might change.

start time: 1697:56:50.000
end time: 1707:07:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yes. And what we did brought us into compliance and the curriculum cycles happen Every seven years. So we will be right back out of compliance if we do not maintain a regular schedule for our adoptions. So we've outlined what that would be. What area would be up to maintain that seven year. You could be about two years, you know, within that. And so what we've outlined does get us back in compliance and then on a good path moving forward.

start time: 1707:13:50.000
end time: 1709:54:46.000
confidence: 0.94
A: When you say adoption, so. And I'm, I'm new at this, so I'm learning. So when you talk about the adoption and is that, that's not new curriculum, is it? Or it could be.

start time: 1709:57:18.000
end time: 1718:25:00.000
confidence: 0.93
C: It is. Yeah. So you, I'll use something tangible. You approve the math adoption. Right. So that math adoption will come yet again every seven years and will bring forward to you based off of our air committee, our adoption, you know, advisory committee with teachers and everyone reviewing multiple options will bring forward to you that the board, the best option that we have selected for then your approval and then the funds would come from, from here to support that from.

start time: 1718:31:20.000
end time: 1719:21:00.000
confidence: 0.99
A: So it could be a whole new math adoption in seven years.

start time: 1719:27:20.000
end time: 1728:54:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Everything. Right. So I mean the cycle, the cycle goes Science, math, world language, English language arts, English language proficiency, health and PE and social sciences. Rinse, repeat. Right. Like it keeps going. It never stops. And that's what we haven't done in our system. Right. We didn't align with the seven year cycle and hence that's why we needed this huge lift initially. So our ask is less than what we initially needed, but we do, in order to not dip into the gen fund, we do need, we do need this support.

B: Virginia laforte. Hey, guys. So I'm Virginia laforte. It's La Space, Atherson, Frank O R T E. And I'm here today on behalf of the Grant Bowl Community Coalition and the Grant School community to comment on the 2024 bond and how it relates to Grant High School. We read, we all read the documents that were linked in the agenda for today, and we specifically wanted to call out some questions about the long range facilities plan. The bond plans for athletics clearly rely heavily on it, but now that we've had some recent changes, it's flawed. It doesn't include the Grant bowl, which is now part of the PPS real estate portfolio. So we all know it'll be one of, if not the most heavily used asset in the PPS portfolio. So we're asking for PPS staff to take the steps necessary to amend the plan to include the Bull and to include it as a high priority just to ensure that the Grant Bull master plan is included and not overlooked in the 2024 bond. We haven't seen it pop up yet, so we've been where we were a little concerned. And we're also, as you hopefully will do that, ask that you simultaneously peel off the lights, as you've been hearing us, you know, come back over and over and ask, peel it off so that we can address funding for the lights separately and more quickly since they directly impact, you know, the educational hours for our students and they are a revenue generator. I know we're still waiting on the estimate that Director Brim Edwards requested. It's been almost two months and we're still kind of waiting on that lights only estimate. So we were wondering what the status of that is. And, and also to let you know that the Grant Park Neighborhood association did meet last week as a board and passed their own resolution supporting the urgent need for lights at the Grant bowl, which was really exciting. It's a big change of pace from where we were 13 years ago. So I guess essentially, to borrow Director Green's words, that we can't keep kicking this can down the road. We're discussing multi million dollar, I'm sorry, multibillion dollar bonds using a long range facilities plan that doesn't include the athletic facility for our largest high school, one that has definitively never had lights, bathrooms, bleachers, nothing. So it's really important to Northeast Portland families. We've got thousands of students who live here and we're celebrating our centennial Year. And we're still, you know, we're still sitting here in the dark. So that's all I wanted to say.

F: Chair Hollins, board of directors. My boss's boss's boss's boss. Okay, everybody. I'm an electrician from the maintenance team, and if you can remember, I spoke last month regarding the ABT concerns that we had for our maintenance department, making sure that we have a smooth transition both in location and how we land space wise. I'm going to paraphrase all this because I am glad to see Dana. Dana's been really good at communicating with me, and I've been able to communicate with her maintenance team through the DCU Labor Management Committee team. So we've been able to grab a lot of information from the boots on the ground in terms of what we need. And I'M really glad to see that. We had a survey given today that was the start of finding a location. I found it to be a little bit on the undetailed side, but I just want to make the point that it's so important that we find a central location that gives equity to all the schools and makes us efficient because lack of efficiency creates lack of production and more cost for the taxpayers to get the same work done. This has been an awesome site for 45 years. And though we need to leave and I'm glad it's not going to be a 100-year-old building before we leave because we've worked on those buildings, it has been fine tuned to the best maintenance that we can provide. All the tools, all the processes, every single dock, every parking spot on the fleet deck, our warehouse people, all the space that we have and that we've filled up since it's been emptied in the late 90s. It's all filled up with new tasks, new processes, and our grounds team, hopefully re channeling them back to our central maintenance team. I just wanted to be here and let you know that I'm very committed to helping the board, to helping the COO and our maintenance and facilities operations teams with doing with whatever I can. And as a graduate of Jefferson High school, class of 1988, I'm also here to thank everybody that was here to rebuild the alma mater that I so proudly came from and that built the person I am today. I also wanted to say that I wanted to make sure that our team stays as efficient as they are in the new land. And whatever I can do to provide that information, I want to be there available and to the taxpayers, to all the stakeholders, but most effectively to be the most effective maintenance team for the students.

A: I don't, not yet. You know, we're in, you know, we're just exploration phase right now. But you know, one of the, the main things that has, at least as far as I know with the board, is to make sure that we not only get what we have, but possibly get better than what we have as well. Yeah. And so I think that's kind of the, the mindset that we're walking in this with is that, hey, we want to at the very least have what we have now, but also to do better. There's no sense of going into a space where we just got the bare minimums versus going to a space where we're, you know, have better than what we had. So it's like I I look at it like we're upgrading to a house. You know, I don't need to go to another 1200 square foot house. I'm leaving a 1200 square foot house, so.

F: And a lot of our building ages are growing from 100 years, you know, to the most recent technology. And I don't have to tell you, the technology is just expanding so fast, so that to the 100-year-old buildings is just such a huge area that we are going to need to expand, you know, and our processes and our tools and our diagnostics, and maybe even our crew someday.
