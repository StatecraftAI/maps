A: This public regular meeting of the Board of education for August 6, 2024 is called to order. All items being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the Board and meetings tabs. This meeting is being streamed live stream being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 8 will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. Good evening and welcome everyone. Thanks for being here this evening. Tonight Chair Wong is joining us virtually and I see that you've joined hi Chair Wong as he is on a long ago scheduled family vacation. Before we get started, I want to share a few housekeeping reminders before we ask that you please be considerate of those around you. Keep any signs behind level and I'd like to emphasize that our primary objective is to engage in the business and services of our children. We want everyone to be examples of being respectful and courteous to each other, including board members, even when we disagree. You'll note that we have a new seating chart to start off the new year that was a collaboration between Director Green and Director Wong. And we have the student representative sitting kind of in the middle of the dais to represent his. To hear the student voice and center the student. Almost literally center the student voice. So we'll start with student comments. Ms. Bradshaw, do we have any students signed up?

C: Yes, I do. All right. Good evening everyone. I'm excited to be here and start my role as student representative to the Board of Education with the main goal of representing each and every student here at Portland Park Public Schools. I look forward to serving as a change maker alongside my colleagues here at the board and helping to create and restore the community trust and confidence within us. This year I plan on focusing on some key priorities which include communication, equity, student safety and wellness and fostering district pride. Now let's talk about what students have been up to this summer. A student led organization called PPS Flea Market at IDB Wills High School hosted an event and over a hundred student vendors participate in selling clothes and items. Our student athletes from high schools and youth programs have participated in summer practices. I look forward to seeing how they will make their school communities Proud and our PIL community proud as well. As summer programming comes to an end, our students have participated in summer programs such as Summer Scars, Early Kindergarten, Transition Summer Acceleration Academy, and others. This year, I look forward to working alongside the district Student council to bring a new vision of student leadership and advocacy to our district and schools. On September 15, the district will be sharing a student survey regarding the cell phone policy. We've heard a considerable amount of feedback from parents and staff, but less from students. I believe it's crucial to set our student voice in our decision making at the district level and schools. So students, when you see the survey, please share your perspectives and opinions on the policy. In conclusion, while some students are excited about going back to school, some wish summer was longer. And I want to say I'm thrilled to welcome back the Astros to their home campus at Benson Valley Titanic High School.

D: Oh, it's okay. I will talk slowly until we're up and going. Just super excited to launch Leadership this week. The instructional leadership team did an amazing job of setting the tone and welcoming our principals, our assistant and vice principals, as well as some school base and district administrators. Back at two Grant High School was the hosting school, but really all over the district. And so we were able to kick off the event this morning with Dr. Paul Coakley, Superintendent from the Multnomah Education Service District. He did a wonderful job grounding us and really sharing stories and connecting to his why. Not only his personal why, but his why as county superintendent. So that was super exciting to hear. Thank you. We can just go right to slide two. Thank you. And then just a reminder that on Friday, August 9th, I will be giving my remarks at 11:15am I look forward to seeing you all there. Little snapshot of Dr. Coakley, Superintendent Coakley opening up this morning. Thank you. Next slide. Super to share the cabinet team, we went off to a retreat. I say went off. We were in Portland, but we had a chance to try out the school bus and do some learning and strategic thinking and collaboration together. And so with that, I just wanted to show you all the org chart for the 2425 school year. It's a little hard to read. This document is uploaded into board books so you'll be able to access it. And so the blues represent those who are on the executive cabinet, but I think a better view will be the next slide so that you can see everyone's picture. And so with that, I just want to pause and talk about some new faces, not only to Portland, but to the executive cabinet. And that is Deborah Caffori. So super excited to have her as part of the team. As you all know, Christina Howard was interim Chief Academic officer. She is now permanent cao. And then one of the things, as you all know, I've been talking a lot about my priorities and vision for my first year. One of the things that I hold very close is safety and security and how are our students are being able to experience that in our schools. And so while it isn't a new position for Molly, moving to the cabinet level is a strategic move. We also have Leslie, who will continue on with us and will serve as senior advisor for strategic transition for a few months. And then of course the second line is all of our returning members this fall. And so super thankful and excited to have some of those members here with us now and those who will join us in the coming weeks. Also thinking of new faces and different spaces as we move on through the slides. I just want to just spend a quick moment sharing new principals and a director at the building level that are in place. Next slide. I'm not going to read all the names and do introductions. I know that you all get notifications from Chief Franco, but these are just putting some of the faces to some of those in the green boxes. You'll see the assistant principals and vice principals. We have three returning folks, but they have new assignments. Right. So same faces in different places. And that's the list of the APs and VPs that have made some moves as well. Next slide. So these principals have made the move to permanent. They were interim last year, so hopefully you're recognizing some familiar faces and names. Thank you. The Office of Student Support Services. As Jay is shoring up his team, we have some individuals who are new to the Office of Student Support Services. So really excited to welcome some familiar faces and then also folks who are from out of the area. So super excited for that. And I know some of you are like, okay, I see the faces and names. When will I have the opportunity to interact with these humans? Well, what I want to share is we are kicking off first Fridays at 4pm every month starting in September, where we will welcome all of our folks who were hired in the previous months to join us in the lobby for a reception so that they're able to connect with the executive leadership team. I invite and welcome board members to come out and shake some hands and share some smiles and words of encouragement for our new employees. So super excited about that. I'll be sharing more information as the first event in September is just around the corner. And really that is my conclusion for the superintendent's report this month. Thank you.

We're now going to discuss a resolution supporting student mental health and learning. Chair Wong, do you want to introduce the resolution on the student mental health and learning that you're proposing? We consider the special meeting on August 20th.

E: Yeah. Thank you for the intro and I apologize for being online. My first board meeting ever, I was also online, so I figured I'd keep this pattern going in August. So one thing I want to really highlight first is, is that this is not. We are not voting on this today. We are. I am wanting to bring this up for discussion only because I want to make sure that we have all our board members input. So to kind of introduce this. I kind of gave the same spiel during policy committee, but I'll give it again. One of the things about PPS is that, you know, we're. We're a big district and just like a big ship, it takes a long time turn. There's growing evidence that cell phone smart device use is taking a toll on our teachers, on our mental health, on our students mental health. And one thing we do want to do make sure we do right is if we are considering. We are considering a new policy and working on that. We want to make sure we do that right and not rush it. We want to make sure we get our students input on the best way forward. We want to make sure we have all input from staff and our teachers as well. And, you know, hopefully the goal for that is we have something in place before the new year. However, one of the. Another big thing that a lot of Teachers have kind of voiced is the importance of the start of the school year because, you know, as every teacher knows, the first two weeks is absolutely vital in establishing routine and expectations for our students. And one thing that this draft resolution is trying to do is trying to kind of be kind of a gap solution until we can work out a really good policy in that it's trying to. Again, the point of this resolution is I didn't want it to be a directive because you know, that can be tricky. But I wanted to be more of a statement of values and, and in this case it's trying to give direction so that if there are, you know, one of the problems we have as PPS is that we have cell phone policies that are very, very inconsistent across the whole district. And what this is hopefully trying to do is trying to, you know, if there are people on the fence in terms of enforcing cell phone policies or not, this kind of gives them like, hey, we are working on this and there's something going to happen. So if you're going to do something, you know, go ahead and do it because we got your back. And so that's what this, the point of this resolution is for, is to show that, you know, our teachers, overwhelming number of teachers have said that this is an issue that needs a solution and it is trying to convey that yes, we are hearing you and we are trying to work on this as best we can. PPS being such a big district, things take time. So if in the meantime this is a statement of values showing that we are, we are on it and we really care about this, we care about our students mental health and, and, and committing our district to really problem solve with you and get something that works for all of us. And so what I would like is if already I shared this with, through email and in policy committee and I know Director Brim Edwards has already shared quite a few good ideas, great ideas and edits that we, that we've incorporated. Director Sullivan, also I appreciate your, your feedback. I think those are really good and I would like to incorporate those. And now it's up to the, the rest of the board members. I would like to hear from, from all of you to make sure that we have everyone's input.

confidence: 0.94
A: Thank you. Director Wong or Chair Wong. Director Edwards, did you want to, would you want to talk about your comments? It's in board books. Everybody should have a copy.

start time: 256:33:10.000
end time: 286:45:28.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Sure, I'm happy to do that. We didn't have much time before the policy committee meeting to look at this to provide back. I provided Limited on the fly feedback during the policy committee. And so when we got this revised one out of the policy committee, I had some additional comments. I'll try and sum them up at least the major one. There's some just minor technical cleanups that I had in here. But one of the things is we should have consistent terminology. I think believe in the draft policy we use the word cell phones and similar devices but in this document we call them cell phones and we call them personal smart devices. So it just should be consistent. And I would suggest that we have them be consistent with what our policy is going to be. And then in F it talks about what's happening at Grant, Cleveland and Beaumont. And I added sentence that just says that individual schools and PPS have policies related to use of cell phones and similar devices during this school day because it made the resolution kind of made it sound like only these three schools are doing something. And I'm pretty sure that all schools have some sort of policy. And so I think we should state that versus making it just sound like three schools are working on this. And in the following sentence about Grant, Cleveland and Beaumont, I add that what's different about them is they actually have an enforcement tool. So I modified that because I think when people are looking at this they may think like why are those schools the only ones have done something, excuse.

start time: 286:45:44.000
end time: 287:53:00.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Me, on the enforcement tool are those the yonder couches?

start time: 288:36:00.000
end time: 304:18:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: And then I mean most of the rest of them are I think just mostly clarification in the who we're going to solicit feedback from. I've just added parents in addition to families. And then it had just district administrators. And I went to school and district administrators. I found the panel the other day of the principal's very informative. So I want to make sure that we're including them. And then also just on the last sentence added a clarification that what the policy is, which is restrictions on cell phones during the school day. So I think they're relatively minor cleanups. And with a couple clarifications.

start time: 305:01:00.000
end time: 306:12:04.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I'll go next Director Sullivan, because you have comments as well.

start time: 306:13:32.000
end time: 313:24:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Yeah, I just the last under resolve number two, it says the district shall provide the necessary support and or resources for schools to implement a district wide policy. And I don't think we can say we'll give the resources at this point because we don't know if we have the money for it. So I'd like to have it say the district shall provide the necessary support and will work to find the resources to implement this policy.

end time: 322:03:00.000

end time: 381:07:38.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Well, I'll start. I may have a couple more. I appreciate the resolution. I think that one of the things that came up in that policy committee meeting that I thought was a really good point was making sure that we as a board and as a district have defined the problem we're trying to solve. And very specifically, I mean, there. There were three things that come up. There's probably more. One of those things is around, you know, teen mental health or, you know, child childhood mental health. A second was around achievement students student achievement. A third was around bullying, harassment. And again, those are not exclusive. I'm sure there's other reasons as well. I think it's really important because as I, as I listen to that conversation, the policy you come up with, that we come up with ultimately as a district can be a little bit different depending on which one of those we're trying to solve. And so, you know, just as an example, I mean, when I think about, you know, student achievement, and I will say that's the one for me that rises to. To the top that we should really focus on is, you know, we're not. If we can contribute to more positive mental health among our teens, that's amazing. We're not going to solve the mental health crisis right. Among teenagers by doing something with cell phones. So not that it's unimportant, but we can really solve that sort of student achievement engagement issue. But just as an example, that would say, well, we should not allow them for sure, you know, in classes, but maybe we would allow them in passing periods or lunchtime. However, like bullying and harassment or mental health may say we should ban them overall. Not that these are necessarily contradictory goals. We may be trying to do all of them, but I just think it's really important for us as we go through that process to just identify what are we trying to solve and prioritize a Little bit. Which of those, you know, sort of rises to the top for our, for our policy. And then the other thing I just, I wanted to clarify and it comes up, and it came up in that meeting a little bit already tonight. But, but I think it's important to just keep saying, we as a district already allow schools and teachers to prohibit cell phone use. So there is no, when we're talking about a policy on cell phone use, that, that policy already, or maybe it's a lack of policy, but it already exists in the sense of any school can ban cell phones, prohibit the use of cell phones throughout the day, and any teacher in their classroom can prohibit the use of cell phones. And many do. And I think what I wanted to hear, Director Wong, you've raised a number of times teachers feeling that lack of support. And I understand that. I think, I think it's important for us as a board and as a district to set a district wide policy. But I also think it's really important to explore why our teachers feel unempowered to do that in their classroom. What is that, what is that feeling that if they, if they're looking around and saying, this is not a good learning environment, it's not a good teaching environment, what is keeping them from saying, you know what? No, we're going to do this? Is it the challenges of enforcement? Is it pushback they're getting from parents? Are they getting pushback? I hope they're not getting pushback from administrators. Are they getting pushback from students? And I just think that again, passing a policy is one thing. Enforcing that policy and making it work is another. This came up during the policy committee meeting as well. But simply passing a policy is not going to lift the burden from our teachers of having to enforce it. And so if they're struggling right now to enforce what they think is good classroom behavior, I'm not, I'm not all that sure that us saying, yep, you should go ahead and ban it is going to impact that challenge that our teachers are facing. So I just encourage us. We need to, like, that's what's really going to solve the problem, is figuring out on the ground what's happening. And there may be another point from the meeting which I'll think about, but those are the two.

start time: 381:08:34.000
end time: 411:07:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Can I just respond briefly to that? So I think the simplest analogy is like when the kid has two parents that have two different points of view and my kids opinion shop a lot because Randall's usually the weak link. But I think what the focus of the policy I know that's not surprising. That's why they always go ask him first. The focus having some district wide expectations because that then sets expectations for students that it's not each classroom is going to be different, a different set of rules. And it also, it's not school by school and also not classroom by classroom that we have a clear set of expectations, that we've thought through it and that we've also thought through ways in which it'll be enforced and in ways in which we'll provide district level and I appreciate Patty, your comments, but how we'll provide supports for implementation of the policy. So I think that's been the focus and that came out in like some of the emails that we've had and just the surveys from different teachers and administrators. Is this like the inconsistency of expectations? Like some classes it's okay to like listening to music with your visit in the next class. It's not or I'm going to use my phone for an assignment in the next class. It's got to be off and away. So I think that's a general, a general thrust but I think we should keep asking that question.

start time: 411:14:00.000
end time: 428:53:54.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Yeah, yeah. And I think there can be some real value. I hope my daughter's not watching because I know I brought her up last time as we've talked about this policy. Every time I've suggested a potential policy, she immediately tells me the four or five ways that she can think of to thwart it. And so again our consistency is important, but that enforcement on the ground is going to be equally important. If we pass a policy but we don't empower our teachers, give them the support or administrators to actually if enforce it on the ground, it's not going to in the end make a difference. And so I just, that's a, it's a part of the implementation is going to be really important. The other thought did come to me. I know there was a lot of conversation in the last policy committee around exceptions. Those exceptions are important. But what I was, I'll just tell you, listening to the meeting afterwards, what I was struck by is we haven't even decided what the policy is yet. So those exceptions are important. But let's figure out the policy and then I guarantee we can carve out exceptions for medical use, for educational use, for you know, ADA accommodations. Like all those can happen but I don't want to spend too much time on those up front before we lose sight of like what are we actually going to, going to do.

A: So thank you Dr. Wong. Chair Wong?

end time: 462:13:30.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, I just want to respond really quickly. All amazing points. I love those points. Director Sullivan, I think, I think your suggestion for the support and or. Yeah, I think originally I put and. Or resources. Because it doesn't have to be resources, you know, it could be support. But I think I like your language better so I would like to go with that. Director Scott, I agree with everything you said. I think that's part of the reason why during policy committee, you know, I was really pushing for that last part, which is that the district will provide the support and or resources to make sure this policy happens. Because one of the biggest problems, you know, I was lucky enough to have taught before smartphones and I say lucky with big capital letters because it's true. The face of classroom management has completely changed after smartphones. And one of the struggles that teachers have all the time is, is that the burden of enforcement is placed upon them. And that is, I mean, among the thousands of other things they have to do a day, that's just, you know, it's borderline too much. It is too much. So that. And I think one of the struggles we deal with also as policy is that we want to create a policy but not necessarily create specific solution. Right? Because things change, right? There could be new, new ideas, new new solutions that come up in the future. And one of the reasons for putting that whole part about, you know, district will provide the support to make this possible is to address exactly what you're saying, which is that we need to figure out how to make it so that our teachers feel supported and the burden of enforcement is not in, you know, completely dependent on that.

confidence: 0.92
A: Thank you, Chair Wong. I also wanted to say, Director Scott, I appreciate that you want us to understand what we're solving for. One of the things in addition to teen mental health, the achievement gap, persistent achievement gap and the bullying harassment. We heard from principals during our policy committee that the bullying harassment kind of increases during passing times and lunch, which is why they would advocate for all day away, off and away policy. We're also trying to Chair Wong's point. Solving for teachers having, having disparate policies and rules and practices classroom by classroom, which is confusing for students and it's not helpful. And I think to share Wong's point about the classroom management, how it's changed post smartphones is compelling. Especially you know, when we look in the classroom, look at the older kids, it's compelling. So yeah, I heard from the principals that they would like to keep the phones out and away and also that the teachers are burdened by having different policies, building by building and classroom by classroom. And it does take away from, you know, this important instructional time. Dr. Hollins.

start time: 486:22:08.000
end time: 565:05:00.000
confidence: 0.94
H: Yes. So, I mean, I think the policy is interesting. A couple reasons. One, you know, when we talk about leaning into technology and I worry, and this is just myself, I worry about urban districts really blocking technology in a time that technology is increasing. And it seems like we should be leaning into technology because it seems like if we are going to block technology, then our urban kids is going to get further behind in technologies like AI being able to use technology in their everyday life, which all of us do. Whether we're doing emails on our phones or whether we're signing documents on our phone or whether we communicate on our phones, these are things that we are we as an adult, we are doing. So if we're blocking it or not, leaning into, are we, are we going to be leaving our kids behind in that aspect as other communities are leaning into those, into those and leaning into technology? Another one is about resources. You know, one of the things about resources and we get them from Salem where we have resources and we say, okay, well now you guys figure it out. You know, if we're talking about a ban for all year, then we need to be looking at how do we finance that, Whether it's whatever methods that we use, rather than just put putting it on the schools individually, you know, because then that, because if you don't, if you do that, then you're going to have some schools who can do it and you have some schools who can do it. And so when we talk about having support, resources is going to be a number one support for implementation. You can have support and say, hey, we want this ban and we passed this policy. But if there is no any resources behind it, it could be a hollow policy that never get implemented because of financial hurdles that we already have. When we talk about teachers workload and the burden is going to be on the teachers. Even if we have a district wide policy, the enforcement is going to be on the teachers. And I think we need to be really clear about that. Like this is not going to take that additional burden off a teacher. This is going to add burdens because now it's a district wide policy. And if the kids, when they're doing something, they're going to be doing it in their classrooms, whether it's having an extra phone, whether it's a smartphone, whether it's smart glasses, right? These are technologies that's out there and it's going to be up to the teachers to enforce it. So I just want to make sure we're clear that there is going to be enforcement on teachers. The other thing is, what happens if the students don't abide by this? Is this a disciplinary action? Is this a disciplinary action for, you know, kids whose parents say, well, I don't care, I want you to have your phone. And so I will hope that in this policy that we will make sure we address the, whatever ramifications of a kid either not abide by in it or, you know, I just don't hate. I would hate for the discipline to go back on to our black and brown kids like, or mostly our discipline as it is now. And also, you know, when we're talking about, like Grant and I was happened to be at the Grant meeting when the principal was talking to the pta, you know, well, what happens if the kids lose the pouch? Well, the kid had to pay for the pouch, you know, for a replacement. If a kid forgets to walk out and unhook the pouch from the thing. Well, these things I think we have to really take in consideration because if a kid forgets he's not going to wait till he get back to school to open his pouch, he go get some scissors, he go get whatever he needs to do to open the pouch. And then that could be additional financial burden on the student, or it's going to be additional burden on whether it's the school district, whether it's the school or what have you. So I just want to make sure that as we are really looking at this policy, that we really look at everything comprehensively to make sure that we're not setting something up for failure, unintended consequence, and make sure we take the time to make sure we are doing it right and we're getting the research done, but also making sure that, you know, by doing something that we think is good today is not going to affect our kids 5, 10, 15 years from now.

A: I appreciate that. I worked at a consultancy where they actually encouraged the children, people's children, to use their phones as a tool for the same reasons that you mentioned. It sounds like what I heard is you want us to consider any unintentional consequences once we draft this policy.

B: And I'll just say we're building a timeline in which, because there was, as you might remember earlier this summer, discussion about can we hurry up and do it before the start of school? And we've decided intentionally not to do that in order to hopefully get some secure lessons learned from not only the three Schools that have policies. Because I think you raised some great issues, Director Hollins. And also the other thing is there are other school districts that are adopting different enforcement tools that we will be able to, and they're starting in September, that it will be also able to, I think, learn from there. So hopefully by pacing ourselves and not being sort of first out of the box, we also will end up with a better policy. I appreciate you raising that.

A: Chair Wong, did you have your hand up?

start time: 590:20:10.000
end time: 648:15:26.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yeah, thank you. I just want to appreciate Director Hollinson for raising those points yet. Absolutely right. We do have to be careful to make sure we do it right so that there are no unintended consequences. The other thing I also want to point out, right, this is, you know, in terms of teachers versus phones, one of the coolest things that a couple things that kind of came up this summer is, you know, as we were hanging out and stuff like that, there are some parents that I've heard that, you know, had no idea I was a board member anyways, and they mentioned about how they want to transfer their kids from outside PPS into Grant because they heard they were going to use the yonder pouches. And I thought that was really interesting because it was unprompted and everything. Another thing I also heard was. Or sorry, not heard, but no, there's a few teachers I know of that took professional development about how to implement AI into their curriculum and how to use it. And, you know, like, for example, like Director Hollins, where you're talking about how to make sure our students are on the, on the cutting edge of understanding technology. And one of the things that they're talking, you know, I asked the teacher about phones, and it was, you know, they pointed out it was a whole separate conversation because, you know, in school they use their Chromebook access, they have computer lab access. They have other means. But the problem with the cell phones is that it's fighting an addiction. I mean, we know that. We know that app companies, they use Addiction Science. One very famous one that Addiction Science knows is like the Skinner effect, which is this effect where I don't know if you know, but have heard of it, but there's this thing where they use lab rats and there's like they pull a lever and a pellet comes out. And if they pull a lever and every time a pellet comes out, every time they pull a lever, you know, it's just normal. They feed themselves. It's great. But what they did was they. They made it so the pellet only comes out Once in a while so they pull a lever and then maybe every, you know, few times you'll come out randomly and, and what they observe is a lot of these rats start going into self destructive behavior like pounding their head against the glass and stuff like that and can't stop pulling the lever. I mean that's, that's kind of, I mean, humans are a little smarter than rats, hopefully most of us. And, and you know, we know that, you know, addiction science has come a long way in that, that a lot of app companies, they use addiction science to hook, you know, adults, but also kids. And if we're, if we're, if we're talking about a potential solution that may especially help our kids that have maybe the most struggle with controlling addiction, addictive behaviors. I mean this, this could be a very big win in terms of, you know, raising our student performance, especially some of the students that most need help. So I just want to make sure that we keep that in perspective. But also part of, the, part of the purpose of policy and all your points are completely valid. We have to make sure that this is not something that we just again, another policy restricting and it's just going to throw the burden right back on the teachers. Again, we have to make sure. And part of the reason for really focusing on this is, you know, how do we make a policy so that it is also part of the administrators and the district to support our teachers in creating a solution that works. What works is going to evolve and that's kind of where the difficulty in the policy creation is. I think. So. Yeah. Thank you for your input. I really value what all of you said.

start time: 648:17:58.000

confidence: 0.95
H: I just have one last question. When we talk about the data and I don't, I don't know about comparing our, our kids with addiction piece. You know, my mom has been a recovering addict for the last 35 years. So you know, when we throw out the addiction word, that, that makes me think of something that I don't, I wouldn't associate with our kids. But when we talking about the academic achievement, is there data showing a correlation between cell phone policies and rising achievement?

start time: 658:01:40.000
end time: 658:52:44.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I think I can answer that. Superintendent, please.

start time: 658:55:32.000
end time: 683:25:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Oh, yeah, I wasn't gonna, I was gonna follow what doctor or I'm sorry, what Director Holland said. I was thinking the same thing. And I, I just want to make sure that we're doing our part on the instructional side of the house and the support service side of the house because I get a little worried hearing that cell phones is to counteract addiction. I think that the Removing of the devices for creating this distraction free zone could be beneficial. But I also want to make sure that there are some supports that our buildings will need, especially if all the research is true, that all of the distractions will trigger some addiction like behavior or maybe there are students that are addicted, as we know. You know, removing a cigarette from someone who's addicted to smoking isn't going to make them stop. Right. That there's a process. And so I guess I would just ask, as you all continue to consider the policy and the resources and support that, to think of the resources that we'll need within the system to continue to strengthen our mental health and student support services so that our building leaders can have resources beyond pouches to address some of the things that are coming up for students. It would be remiss of me if I didn't mention that.

C: Student Representative Yeah, I think I had a question on like the draft pool policy because I know it talks about how phones shouldn't be visible during the normal school hours and school activities. And so I was kind of wondering some clarity on the school activities part. Is that meaning school clubs or after school clubs or for example, prom or homecoming, if it's at your school, would students be allowed to have their phones at those after school activities?

start time: 691:43:00.000

A: I think that's yet to be decided. So we have a draft in front of us and again we're not voting on it tonight. We're just having open discussion tonight. I just want to remind everybody we have opportunity to interact with the draft. You can make comments on the draft. It's loaded in board book. We will be making a vote on August 20th. We'll have a resolution to vote on. Hopefully that has input from students, from faculty from all of us. And I think I'll move us along. There's a lot more. Before you do that, I also wanted to say that at our policy meeting we did hear about really compelling data, brain science and data that does talk about addiction. And it was promised to us. And I think that we should familiarize ourselves with what the experts are saying about the impact of cell phones on developing brains. I haven't read it myself, but I'd like us to be data driven and making decisions in the best interest of our students in this district. Director Broom Edwards, you had something to add?

end time: 751:21:02.000
confidence: 0.97
B: It's not the policy. This resolution is coming back and so my only question is, you're right. People are going to interact with it.

start time: 751:21:26.000
end time: 752:03:26.000
confidence: 0.91

end time: 753:34:50.000

A: Chair Wong, I don't know if your hand is. If your hand goes down. When I see your hand up, I want to call on you.

start time: 756:19:34.000
end time: 779:45:02.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, yeah. I just wanted some clarifying things. So this resolution is coming back August 20th. This is not a policy. This is just A statement of values. The policy, the actual policy that we're working on, cell phones, has a very big robust community engagement piece as well that we have. I think we're collecting, you know, data, community feedback, student feedback, staff feedback, and then collecting. I think there's a deadline about somewhere around October. And then we're also seeing also the feedback from, and the data collecting from the three, the three schools that are using the pouches. So that's a whole separate thing. That's, that's a policy and that, that is going to be big. So again, and then I want to move on to my question and this may go to legal. My question is I don't want this to be a surprise on August 20th. So is there a way that we can. I would like to start, I would like to identify a process. So for example, like right now I am managing this document and my vision is that all of you would send your recommendations and edits and I would just make edits and then share with everyone. But I also want to make sure that we don't, you know, want to avoid some kind of, you know, serial meeting and stuff like that. So is there a process that we can follow that we can keep updated about the latest version legally and then by August 20th?

start time: 779:46:06.000
end time: 780:29:34.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Yes, I would recommend we convene tomorrow.

start time: 780:30:22.000
end time: 780:46:06.000

I: And talk about that process.

start time: 780:47:18.000
end time: 785:31:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I'm sure we can get one that will be entirely legal, but also help solve the concerns you have about incorporating all the feedback. I'd love to work with you on that tomorrow. Or at your convenience, my calendar shows we do have a policy committee meeting on the 19th.

start time: 785:49:02.000
end time: 796:26:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah. And again, this is a resolution that will be ideally voting on August 20th and that's to signal to the community that it's a value statement that it's coming and to set the stage for, you know, school starts 10 days after that. We won't have a policy prepared probably until October or we were considering the second semester. So after the holidays, that gives us time to do the community engagement, student engagement, to read any data that we need to read to educate ourselves about the impact of cell phones. Does that sound right?

confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah. I mean, I'm setting up a timeline that works with the board meetings, the 21 day comment period. I mean, it obviously also will depend on how much public comment we get and whether we ended up having a second reading, a second first reading. But ideally we're not going to have data back from. Dr. Adams has put together a draft schedule for this is the student survey that we're going to be working with, but we won't get it back till the 15th. And obviously we won't have data after the school starts. So, I mean, it's going to be tight, have it completed by then. We're gonna do our best, but also we want to make sure that we have. I mean, even tonight, there's just a lot of issues that have been. And good points that have been raised.

We'll now move to the consent agenda. The board will now vote on the consent agenda. Board members, if there are any items, additional items that you'd like to pull for a later meeting, we will set those aside for the next we meet.

And I don't need it now, but I would like to have it is we're switching the graduation ceremonies from something that our families will notice are graduation ceremonies from Providence park to Portland State. And I had a number of questions that were answered about that move. But the one question that wasn't answered is the size of the venue. Because right now we don't really have any limits on. So I'd ask, as I had asked before, about what the venue size is. I don't need to know it tonight, but I'd like to know before we get to graduation whether we're somebody.

E: It's a little bit different than Providence. You know, Providence was distinctly. And again, when we're talking about time of immense budget reduction, we had to look at it. And PSU has been trying to establish.

E: And so they're extremely excited, as are we. And talking to high school principals, it meets all of their criteria in terms of indoor enough capacity. Where you're talking about some of our largest high schools, you'll be able to. If you're thinking about Grant graduating class roughly in the. In the high fours, maybe even 500. So we limit capacity for. For some of our larger high schools to around six. But if you look at. And we talked about this with. With psu, they do have extensions in terms of rooms. For example, they have a ballroom where we could do live streaming. We could also rent out other areas over at PSU to do some live streaming. Parking was another piece that was big on the principals a list. And so parking is. Is very accessible. And available. And so that was another piece as well.

B: I pulled this because I looked at the. It's 171,000. It went through an informal procurement process. I looked at the deliverables, and in a year in which we had to cut a lot of things that were near and dear to us, and thinking about what's coming down the pike next year, I. This is. There's nothing particularly in particular wrong with it. It seems like a very high amount for the deliverables that are coming up. It's a marketing and rebranding contract, and for me, it's a prioritization. I just am going to, all throughout the year, be looking at things with an eye of like how when we get to the budget and the decisions we're making on whether it's increasing class sizes by a student or cutting library assistance or the things that we had to do. So it's nothing about the particular contract other than it seems large and not something I would prioritize.

confidence: 0.97
B: I'm sorry, I was giving the. Not the reason why I was pulling it because I. I didn't want to vote against other contracts on the agenda at the same time because there's other. There were other contracts on the agenda that I'm supportive of. So I'm just going through it from a prioritization standpoint.

G: Sure. That's great. No, that's. Thank you. And I guess I would just. I would ask the superintendent. It doesn't have to be tonight. But again, as. And I know you're new, so you didn't make these budget decisions, but as you know, we went through this budget process. Why, you know, why are these. These contracts prioritized? I think. I guess what I would say. I would love to have these conversations ahead of time rather than at the board meetings so that we can really consider and sort of hear both. We think it was maybe too large and needed to be deprioritized. But also why it might be important for the district moving forward. So I'm prepared to vote on this one moving forward because I don't have any other information. Why not?

H: But so I. I actually talked with the director of CTE around it about this and kind of got a better understanding. Yes, yes. Got a great understanding of the purpose. And of course, as a CT person, you know, when we were talking about how we get kids engaged in cte, marketing and branding is the key. Right. Whether it's on social media, whether it's through visuals or what have you. And one of the things that I found fascinating about, because I was skeptical at first, when I first, when we had a conversation, I was like, well, can it get done cheaper, you know, and can it get done locally? And, you know, the. Some of the reasonings of the cost. I think it's because it is such a steep hill for kids to understand one, what CTE is and for families and community to understand what CTE is, but also trying to figure out how do we engage our younger kids and how do we engage, you know, our third graders and fourth graders and fifth graders and sixth graders. And I shared the story when I was at Whitaker, and I shared it before, where we had metal class, wood shop, and we got to do these levels of accomplishments, whether it was a keychain, you know, sixth grade, a mirror to seventh grade, and then you got to build this boat in eighth grade. And because we had that access and we seen that it kept a lot of folks, especially like me, was really interested because I was like, I want to get to the eighth grade because I want to get this boat right? And this was a time that we had, you know, gangs and guns and all that stuff happening. And so talking with them about that and get an understanding of this is more of a. A learning opportunity and also an engagement, especially for our younger kids, to get them engaged and hopefully locked into something by the time they get, you know, in middle high school, you know, and stuff, they've already kind of figured out what they want to do. So this is kind of trying to grab them before that. And so for that, I will be voting yes for this as well.

D: Well, I was hoping. Well, with just a few minutes, I know it sounds like you all are ready to vote, but director Chris gave his time to come in and just share a few words. And so maybe if there's some things you want to respond to about why it's pretty prioritized and just the work that you put in to make sure we Were getting the right work for our money.

J: I'm happy to speak to sort of any pieces of this, but I'll start sort of with the decision making process and how we got to this point. It really was sort of a data driven decision process in two ways. We have a CTE student council and that student council delivered a survey to their peers. And what sort of came from that is that the reason why students are not participating in career and technical education is largely because they do not know that these opportunities exist for them in their. In their buildings. Those are the top response to what makes it hard to do well in cte. And the response was, students need to know more about all the classes available at their school, including cte. What issues affect your participation and career learning experiences? I did not know about these opportunities was the top response. What issues or barriers make it hard to enroll in CTE classes? I had no idea that the courses existed was the second. Anecdotally, as I sort of visited schools this year and asked students what they knew about CTE in CTE classrooms, they did not know what CTE was sort of its general overall purpose. So that's the first piece. The second piece is I think it's important to understand who in our district CTE is serving right now, just 23% of the students who earn completer status, which means they have three credits or more in a single cell pathway. Just 23% of those students are historically underserved. So I mean, 77% of the students who are being successful and persistent in career and technical education are students who are not historically underserved. National data says that students who finish three or more CTE credits graduated around 10 percentage points higher than their peers who don't. And so, you know, if we think about the students who we are who are serving, I think a lot of this comes down to sort of equitable access to career and technical education, a deeper knowledge of what career and technical education is, does, and sort of what the outcomes that are connected to it, and then how we can sort of be more targeted in our support for getting students into these courses. I think second, you know, there's a big role of career and technical education is the role of industry partnerships in driving not just sort of like understanding of curriculum, but also offering internship, mentorship opportunities and in sort of the work that I've done over the last six months, which is tied to my dissertation, which is a conversation we can have a different time. Partners also, generally in our region, don't know how to be involved with career and technical education. And so I think that the. There's a world in which having a comprehensive marketing plan, which, to Director Holland's point, not only is to the benefit of our high school students, really our middle school students sort of in entering high school and knowing the opportunities that are available to them, but further sort of our elementary school students and really understanding, like, career exposure, awareness, all of those things, how they're connected to our CTE programs. I think that this sort of serves to fill a gap around communication that exists about what CTE is and what its sort of overall value is to the district.

G: Thank you. And. Sorry, if I could just. Yeah, I really appreciate the additional information and I guess just to draw a really direct line. I mean, what I'm hearing is the argument is, I mean, this is directly related to student achievement. And of course, one of our bore goals, which is, you know, graduation and all those different pathways. And part of that post, you know, graduation readiness is again, the CTE pathway as well. So that. That's sort of the argument for why, yes, engage.

J: They're sort of a flagship video that sort of speaks to what CTE is. And then there's a second set of videos that are more focused on the role of partners and CTE alumni and parents as well, and sort of their experience with career and technical education. And then further on top of that, it's sort of like the complete branding of what career and technical education is in our district. So that includes all of the sort of visuals that teachers will use to during the forecasting process when they're sort of recruiting students for their classes. It will include any visuals that internally we use as a central office team to promote CTE at things like Benson Tech show and an expansion of some tech shows that will happen at other schools this year. And it includes sort of a redesign of our website, you know, a rebranding of our social media. It sort of is like a complete and comprehensive rebranding of career and technical education in our district. And, you know, sort of working to position it as a number of solutions. One, as a sort of solution to the challenging workforce development issues that, you know, face our city, especially in careers and trades, as one example, but also in its sort of role in terms of, you know, student achievement. As Director Scotsman and I just would.

D: Love to just say really quickly, what I appreciate about Director Breida is that he did first go to our communications team and see if there was capacity to do the work internally and in house, as we are making sure that we cover those bases. And there was incapacity. As you know, we have some vacancies on that team right now. And so there was a protocol that he followed and processed inside before going out.

start time: 1209:59:50.000
end time: 1211:17:18.000

J: So the question is how. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in our strategic plan, if it's.

start time: 1211:17:34.000
end time: 1212:26:30.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Not happening now, I'm just. I'm not sure a video is going to change.

start time: 1212:28:30.000
end time: 1240:02:40.000
confidence: 0.94
J: Absolutely. A great question. I don't think necessarily that the video is the piece that's the way they're going to engage counselors vis a vis students. Vis a vis counselors. I think it has more to do with developing a robust communication plan about. I think it's moving away from this perception that career and technical education is an elective course and that oftentimes times is used as a space to fill a gap in a student's schedule and rather moves us to a place where the way that we're talking about career and technical education is that it's a sequence of courses the same way that we talk about any of core academics. When a student enrolls in, let's say, geometry and mathematics, we have a very clear sequence about what their sort of pathway through math is going to be. We don't talk about career and technical education the same way, but all of the classes are structured in the same way. And that in every CTE program that we have in our district and there are approximately 84 of them. There is an intro class, an intermediate class, and an advanced class. So students are in essence supposed to be getting progressive skills as they move through those programs. But when we look at a student schedule, we're not saying your enrollment in manufacturing is actually a three year commitment to manufacturing or a three year sort of process or timeline or whatever, what have you. We say like, this is what it is for this year and we don't talk about the sort of long term value of it. So I think there is a perception around career and technical education that's not just in Portland public schools, but I think nationally that is, you know, it is like a. It is on the side when in many ways it is and could be a critical part of the core academic experience for students at the high school.

start time: 1240:43:50.000

E: Yeah. Thank you. Director Green, I quick question. You know, because, you know, originally I share a lot of the same concerns that Director Brim Medwards shares because in times of budget cuts, we really have to evaluate what's necessary and what's nice to have. And, you know, if this is leading. Going to lead to increased engagement, especially among the kids who need it the most, I'm fine with that. I would just like to know more about how do we know that, like, what kind of data is going to be collected? Or it may not be data, but. Or maybe it is data. But how do we know that this money you spend is actually going to lead? I mean, thank you, Dr. Armstrong, for sharing your point of view that we explored other options first. I think that was important to hear. But yeah, I just want to know, like, how do we. How do we know that this is going to be money well spent and being effective? Which I'm fine with supporting now, but in the future, you know, I think I would be more strict about asking for that kind of information.

start time: 1271:29:20.000
end time: 1314:54:30.000
confidence: 0.96
J: Sure. First, maybe this is. This is available in the information you have, but I just want to sort of, as an aside, the funding for this proposal comes from Two grants. Both are specific to career and technical education. The first is Perkins funding, which is our national sort of federal funding, and the second is measure 98. Those are both in this year, sort of use it or eluse it grants. Perkins doesn't renew year after year. We give back the money that we don't spend. And measure 98 is at the end of this biennium. So there'll be a new sort of biennium coming up. So to your question, Director Long, about how we're going to know that this is successful, I think there are lots of ways. I think that, you know, first, there is a, you know, I think a successful campaign in, you know, sort of talking about our career and technical education programs is going to lead to increased enrollment in those programs. I think that's like a pretty straightforward and simple, both in terms of the number of students that are enrolled in these programs, but also in terms of the racial makeup of the students that are enrolling in these programs right now. We have that data, and like I mentioned before, it's about 70% of the students who are enrolled in career and technical education are not historically underserved, and about 76% of the students who are completers in career and technical education are not historically underserved. So a big part of our focus is on that sort of equity piece and making sure that we are supporting historically underserved students. And access program that we know nationally shows that, you know, they'll graduate at a higher rate if they sort of persist through this program. So I think that there's certainly data that could be pulled there. And then I think the second piece, and maybe a piece that isn't necessarily as measurable, but it speaks to the sort of relationship with the organization that we're interested in working with, which is Rhodes. Rhodes is a partner with acte, which is the. Which is the largest nonprofit organization that supports career and technical education across the country. And so as a result of our work with them, it would sort of give us access to a major partner in acte, but also the opportunity to talk about the work that we're doing in pps, which I think, you know, certainly from a branding perspective. Perspective is an opportunity that we, you know, would often not turn down and want to be able to talk about the good work that's happening in PPs, career and technical education on a national level.

confidence: 0.96
F: It's unlike me. I will be voting yes. I would like the information I'm asking for. I would like to know if we can somehow look at it and then get back. He made a statement. One of the statements that he made was concerning to me. I love that we're marketing so that, you know, people are going to know more about CTE and what it is and how it. How it can be used and the impacts of it. But the statement was alarming in that you said you questioned people about what CTE was while you were actually visiting CTE classes, and they did not know what it was. So they're actually in a class with an instructor being taught cte and they're not even clear on what it is that CTE is marketing within itself isn't going to change that. You can hang all the flyers in the world and make all the videos in the world. What are we doing about that? That's something that I believe we need to get an understanding of, a clear understanding of, so that we can ensure that every participant who was participating, participating within our CTE courses understands the role that this has and where the projection and where it could take them. The second. The second thing that I want to find out where we're at with is this is. Well, again, I love cte. I love, you know, career technical education. I believe if you teach somebody how to build a house, they'll never have to hire me to come out to do the electrical work in your house. And, you know, I'm saying you can do it yourself and you save hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I get it. Same with plumbing sheet work, sheetrock workers, sheet metal workers, all of these different things. They make buku dollars. So what are we doing to ensure that every school within our district is offering high quality CTE education and not just the school schools that are always more well off, the schools that have more money. Because the other statement that you made, which is. I'm glad you said it out loud, because I was definitely going to say it out loud, is that CTE is something that is predominantly used by the white community or the more affluent community, and the people that could actually really benefit from it, the marginalized, the ones that are almost invisible in classrooms, you know, they, they don't get it. And is it because is there a correlation between, is it being the quality, the level that's being offered in their school is not the same. Is it the, the way that it's being promoted and pushed? Which is why I'm support, I'm supporting the, the marketing. Is that not the same? How do we, how do we figure out what that is so that we can get more people, more people that could benefit from the, that could raise their families on an electrical career, a sheetrock making career, sheet metal career, plumbing career. These buy homes, they put kids through school, they pay for college. How do we ensure that every school and not just the affluent schools are going to be able to offer a high quality CTE education? And maybe that's part of the strategic plan that I haven't seen yet, but I'm excited to hear about one because it's something that, that we need. I, I'm a fan, so I'm gonna vote yes.

H: Yeah. I just want to say. But one of the things that you can get and the reason why I love this, because everyone I know is in cte, whether it's Jerry with his electrical friend of mine on osm, you know, so I think one of the things too is to have those programs in the middle school, right? Get people involved in middle school, getting people engaged in middle school. Because then once you got them, and then as those partnerships work, you know, with, then you can expose them and say, yeah, that's millionaire electrician right there. That's a millionaire such and such right there. And then you can show them what, what it is. But getting it to them at a young age. And I'mma stop.

start time: 1449:38:38.000
end time: 1507:39:40.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Yes, I have some questions. And they come out of the facility and Operations Committee meeting that we had the last one of the last year where there was a presentation on curriculum in General and the spend toward the bond. And everybody has some of the documentation now. But essentially it showed that we were well on our way to spending the complete bond amount and in addition about 23 million more. And then it, in addition, at the presentation, it also showed that if we were going to have, at the time we were talking about a 14 year bond, that it would be 328 million approximately that we would need to have in the bond for curriculum, which I found rather shocking. And also, and concerned that we were on track to spend 20 million in sort of general fund and other resources, not bond funding, to support what had been portrayed as a very healthy amount of funds for all grades, all subjects. And so when the Scott was on the agenda last time, I asked for an agenda item specifically on curriculum because I think we, especially before we get into the bond, need to have a discussion about, I mean, it's a huge number. Frankly, I don't see how it would fit in the bond. But I'm also concerned just about the general tracking of and the expenditures of the funds. Again, it appears that we're on track not just to spend 53 million of our bond fund, but also another 20 million in other funds. So I wanted to pull it off the agenda because one of the things, the SEL curriculum, I am going to vote, I'm going to support it because my understanding it needs to be adopted tonight so that the professional development can happen. And I know the social Emotional learning curriculum is really important. It's just double what was budgeted for. So I'm just like the last one, sort of looking at prioritization, but also thinking that we need a much larger conversation by the board about curriculum and the resources we spend. So with that, I actually have a question about the document that was given, given to us in the context. And I. So should I just ask you the question? So on page the curriculum adoptions, there's a sequencing of the adoptions that still need to happen. And there is about, I want to say 20 to 30 million more that needs to be, that will be just to get us all subjects, all grades. Is that correct?

D: Let me call our senior director Tobin to the microphone, who's prepared to speak specifically towards where we're at with curriculum.

start time: 1510:38:40.000
end time: 1522:29:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And I don't need to go super this, I don't want to go super deep, but what I'm trying to, what we told voters was all subjects, all grades. And when I look at this memo, it appears that, well, I spent the 53 million, but then there's some additional Adoptions that haven't been made yet that would be in addition and beyond. So for example, the 912 science and there were several other ones are those yet to be adopted and say if we had no bond, those would just be paid for with general fund.

I: So several questions in there and good evening. Thank you for inviting me to interact on this really important topic. And huge thanks to the community and everyone who supported the initial bond. And so speaking of the initial intention, if I can go a little bit in the order of the questions, really the emphasis was all subjects emphasizing compliance with ode, which is really six or seven content areas over a six to seven year cycle, emphasizing the four core. And so yes, we accomplished one cycle. Absolutely. We're in compliance to the specific question of 912 science. That adoption wasn't on scale schedule for this this year. That's an ODE cycle for this past year and this upcoming school year. And that work is underway. So when it. I see you may have another question.

start time: 1537:19:30.000
end time: 1543:14:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Well, I'm just saying actually that's not what we told voters. We, I mean there wasn't any ODE adoption asterisk. It was all subject, all grades. And so it wasn't if we're on cycle or off cycle. It was that we would have done everything.

start time: 1543:22:20.000
end time: 1544:20:36.000
confidence: 0.99
I: So we have done 23 adoptions throughout this process.

start time: 1544:21:48.000
end time: 1548:43:40.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out. What hasn't been done and what, how much will that cost? Because I'm just curious because when we go out next to the voters, they'll say, well I thought, I thought you did all you told us all grades, subjects.

start time: 1549:01:20.000
end time: 1582:15:58.000
confidence: 0.96
I: I hear that. I'm thinking through the construct is we have to do ongoing adoptions. And so we had the urgency to come into compliance and we have been in corrective action with ode. We are out of corrective action. We are in compliance and in order to maintain staying out of corrective action, we need to continue to adopt within the cycle. There are some complexities. I hear your questions and I want to respond really directly. There are some complexities. One being social studies was delayed. So one of the things that is really important when we do adoptions is to align with the standards that have been adopted by the state. And that's why we really as a team, our conversations have been about being in alignment with ODE cycles for a few reasons. One, leading with those standards, two, leading with the professional development that happens around the state. So our teams are really broadly interacting beyond just BPs. There's a lot of benefit to that. And then three what I'll add, and this is in part of that memo that you've seen, is it helps us with building out a methodology and rationale and forward thinking of the costs. So we do also have Marcus Walfield on here. I want to make sure and introduce my team member who manages the bond dollars. And this is work that he has done really beautifully in looking at our run rate, looking at our costs. This is muscle we've built since the 2020 bond is really the actual costs in PPS, which for us include complexities such as how we support dual language. Approximately, approximately 30% of an adoption is an additional cost for translation. That's one unique factor that we, you know, I think those. We've built muscle around that and understanding around that from a financial standpoint of the actual spending and the actual dollars needed for adoptions.

start time: 1582:17:34.000
end time: 1585:46:38.000
confidence: 0.94
D: And just to reiterate, I think we're prepared to speak towards the 2020 in that budget, but not necessarily future potential bond curriculum. The team's not prepared to speak to that tonight.

start time: 1585:48:14.000
end time: 1600:58:22.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Okay, two things, I guess. I'm concerned as we head into the discussion about the next bond. The first thing voters want to know is, like, did you spend the money like, as you said you would, and did you spend it effectively? Did we open the schools on time, on. On budget? And so when we got the presentation, I was concerned because it didn't look like we had done all subjects, all grades. And so my question, I guess, is like, to complete that promise, what does that cost? And then, like I say, if we're not prepared to have a discussion, which I just asked that it be a future topic. But since stuff is coming through and it's coming through twice as what it was estimated for, like, I'm gonna rate. I'm gonna raise it as it comes through.

start time: 1601:01:26.000
end time: 1606:18:02.000
confidence: 0.94
G: Director Barnhouse, can I. Maybe I'm just a little slow tonight. What's the concern here? I mean, I guess, and I'm trying to remember back to the 2020 bond. I don't have a recollection of all subjects, all grades, so I'm curious where that's from. I don't think it was in the bond language at all or the ballot title language.

start time: 1606:19:06.000
end time: 1609:01:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: It was what got pitched to us, to the superintendent. We put it in the budget. And then having chaired the bond, that's what we told the voters.

start time: 1609:10:10.000
end time: 1609:50:02.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Sorry, when did we tell the voters this? Like, in what.

start time: 1609:53:06.000
end time: 1613:42:08.000
confidence: 0.94
B: During. During the campaign. And. But it also was, I believe, what this. What the superintendent pitched. The. It was. It was a very large number. We've never, we've never in PPS's the last 25 years spent that much money.

start time: 1613:43:04.000
end time: 1615:56:48.000
confidence: 0.96
G: On curriculum, which we have now spent that much money implementing. I think you said 23 different things, which sounds like a, sounds like a win. So that's why I'm struggling to figure out what the.

start time: 1615:57:44.000
end time: 1619:13:52.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Okay, so you're asking what my issue is. So part of the budget had the SEL curriculum coming in at half the cost of what we're being asked to tonight. Approve is the first thing.

start time: 1619:15:36.000
end time: 1619:50:08.000
confidence: 0.87
G: So the cost has increased from 2020.

start time: 1619:51:04.000
end time: 1619:56:16.000
confidence: 0.81
F: Right.

start time: 1619:57:28.000
end time: 1632:09:04.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So I'm, I'm asking a question which I think is the right thing for us to do from an oversight standpoint. Then second, and I just already told Jay that I was, I'm going to be supportive. I'm trying to understand where we are and what we committed to our voters. And frankly, I asked for this to be just a separate agenda item and to have a good discussion about it, and it's not on the agenda. So I'm going to, when stuff comes up, I'm going to raise the issue because I don't want to. I think what happens is what we've done over the last several years is approve things, but not as part of the larger context. And so what I'm trying to figure out also is like, how far are we from actually meeting what we told the voters?

start time: 1632:11:12.000
end time: 1634:33:40.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Director Edwards, I'm wondering if we do we need to schedule something to have more in depth discussion about this or perhaps an update.

start time: 1634:43:20.000
end time: 1636:20:56.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Well, I mean that is what I asked for two weeks ago, so I'm just.

start time: 1636:23:28.000
end time: 1636:46:48.000
confidence: 0.91
G: Oh, so just two weeks. I mean.

start time: 1636:47:44.000
end time: 1639:11:40.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Okay, well, okay, but now we're, we're voting on some, you know, these things just go through and if, like they just keep going through for tonight.

start time: 1639:40:00.000
end time: 1650:19:20.000
confidence: 0.96
G: And I guess what I'm trying to get is you're using some pretty strong language that somehow we didn't make good on our promise to voters. And I want to be really clear with the public that, that we need to, we need to be careful about that. If, if that's true, if costs have increased and, and in fact to, to do what we said is, is more than the bottom that that happens. It's happened in some of our high schools. It's happened to other things. There's probably good reason for that. I, I also want to be really clear, like I want to make sure we're being clear about what really was promised and by whom. So if this was something the campaign said that was maybe not in coordination with what actually district operational Staff were doing like, like that's not necessarily a district failure, might be a campaign failure. So it feels like there's a lot of things we could potentially talk about here.

start time: 1650:20:00.000
end time: 1652:07:04.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I'm sorry but there's wasn't a. I don't, I don't think there was a campaign failure. We were told that and actually, well.

start time: 1652:07:12.000
end time: 1653:55:52.000
confidence: 0.95
G: All subjects, all grades doesn't mean much to me. I don't know if it means much to the public either. Clearly you have a very specific reason. So that's why I'm trying to get.

start time: 1653:57:36.000
end time: 1656:55:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Our credibility, our district credibility also. I feel like we promise voters things. I'm just trying to get the answer of what, what, what's left. If we're going to do all subjects, all.

start time: 1657:05:30.000
end time: 1661:24:02.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Excuse me. I have a question about if we could. Do we need to schedule a time that we can sit down or an update perhaps that would help you want to. Under you. We put $20 million in the 2020 bond for curriculum.

start time: 1661:25:06.000
end time: 1663:54:58.000
confidence: 0.96
B: We put 53 million and we spent 20 million in general fund, which is a very, as we know, a very valuable resource and some other funds.

start time: 1663:56:34.000
end time: 1664:56:36.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yes. So I'm trying to. Would it help?

start time: 1664:59:08.000
end time: 1665:09:24.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Not yet.

start time: 1665:10:52.000
end time: 1667:28:52.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Apparently an update about where we are with this funding. An accounting of.

start time: 1667:31:56.000
end time: 1669:47:32.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Yes. I thought it was not going to be. I guess we haven't even let you answer the question is like what's left and how much is it going to cost?

start time: 1669:47:56.000
end time: 1669:51:16.000
confidence: 0.56
E: Yeah.

start time: 1669:51:48.000
end time: 1684:46:32.000
confidence: 0.96
I: So I mean just briefly, briefly stated this year we're continuing with the 912 science adoption. That adoption year was this year or next year. You can do it within a two year span. So we're right within that window. We don't want to go outside of that window. So we would not have wanted to do that prior to this last school year. We're continuing with the health adoption, really tailoring that to PPS's needs. The first wave didn't yield what we had hoped for. So that's continued work. And then 912 social emotional learning, the, the third phase of the SEL which I could pass to Chief Puno for more detail on. So I hear your question and I think one of the challenging pieces with that is that we also are saying all subjects, all grades and we all want to do that in compliance and in alignment with the six to seven year cycles. So we are in compliance for our first wave and we are continuing to.

start time: 1684:46:56.000
end time: 1696:13:18.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Do work well and also just the cycles. Understanding the impact to teachers in buildings, especially at certain levels where they may have to then roll out new curriculum across multiple classrooms and grade Levels, but social studies is in that too, of your list. Okay. And so we can. And there's some timing things. There's some. I think, as mentioned before, there's some ODE guidance. But my preference would be for us to be able to report back more details on where we're at with the bond funds related to curriculum.

start time: 1696:14:54.000
end time: 1700:53:30.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Well, and yes, I appreciate that. So it sounds like there's four tranches of additional five. There's social studies, science, health, third phase of sel, social student. And what else? Oh, okay, that's.

start time: 1701:05:50.000
end time: 1701:30:50.000
confidence: 0.89
D: Is there war language?

start time: 1701:49:50.000
end time: 1704:25:42.000
confidence: 0.91
I: Yeah. So we do have continued work to do in social cities, and we made some decisions around that to make sure that we align with ODE's standards, which are forthcoming.

start time: 1704:26:46.000
end time: 1725:45:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Well, I don't want to lose the point, though, that Senior Director Tobin pointed out is that just as we're ending another cycle, we'll be reincarnated the team, in another curriculum adoption. So it's a moving target to say, like, all subjects, all grades. Like, that's not like one year to be done. That could be over multiple years. I think the question is, is that a burden that falls on taxpayers or is that something that we budget for in our district budget. And I, you know, feel strongly that it's important for us to allocate funds as they become available as a set aside to address curricular needs. And I think the 2020 bond was extremely helpful in helping us catch up, as there were some findings with the State Department and there were some expectations that we get caught up pretty quickly. And we've done that in other places where we're not yet there. It's on their timeline and they know exactly where we're at. So we've met the corrective action from the Division 22 report. And so I think we feel strongly that we've responded to whatever the language or needs were out of 2025.

start time: 1725:54:40.000
end time: 1734:27:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I think that I'd like to have a further understanding of what that is and doesn't be here tonight, but that's the question I'd like to have. And again, it was presented. And again this before I think you started, Superintendent Armstrong, but it was presented like the ask for curriculum was 320something million from the bond, which this is future bond.

start time: 1734:42:50.000
end time: 1734:48:50.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Right.

start time: 1734:49:30.000
end time: 1739:01:56.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Which is we're. Because we were planning to have it on the November ballot. Now we're at the May ballot and we're going to be doing that work over the next weeks. So trying to get reconciled with where we were from the last bond.

start time: 1739:03:48.000
end time: 1742:38:28.000
confidence: 0.96
D: We have some internal work to do on that that's not the recommendation for me at this point, the 300 million. And I think we have some more talking to do as a team on what our recommendation will be for the next bond.

start time: 1742:40:04.000
end time: 1758:34:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: It was in the material that was given to us. Okay, I'm going to be supportive of tonight, but I think we really need to get this nailed down and sort of what your philosophy is, because I agree maybe it shouldn't be a bond number. But I'd also like to know, as we talked about in committee too, that we. There's school districts like Salem that don't have a local option where they get a hundred million dollars less a year. And it's like, how are they effectively driving student achievement and having high quality materials? Because I don't think they're paying 300 million or whatever the amount, or even 50 million. So that's what sort of the rigor I'd like to understand. And the reason I brought it up is that we're voting. Me voting on something that's twice the amount that had been anticipated.

start time: 1758:35:30.000
end time: 1768:41:16.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I think the only thing I would say to Director Scott's point is that I think we're very thankful to our taxpayers for supporting the 2020 curriculum bond because as a result, we're in full compliance with the state now. And without that bond, we wouldn't have had the funds to be able to be in compliance so quickly. And so four years later we're able to say that we're in compliance. While that does not mean that all subjects for all students have been adopted, we are now, for the first time in quite some years, meeting the expectation of the State Department.

start time: 1768:43:48.000
end time: 1773:15:34.000
confidence: 0.98
G: Yeah, I appreciate that before. I mean, it just seems like this is a huge win for the district in terms of the voter support, the money, how well it's been spent, all the work that's been done on that. So I just want to make sure we take this, you know, like see that for what it is as a really positive step forward. And it's an ongoing thing. Curriculum adoption never stops.

start time: 1773:17:42.000
end time: 1775:55:34.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And as a person who chaired the bond, I appreciate that too. And I also know when we go back out to voters, whether it's for our local option or the bond, we.

start time: 1775:55:42.000
end time: 1777:18:46.000
confidence: 0.92
G: Can talk about the win. We can what we talk about the win when we go back out to voting.

start time: 1777:19:18.000
end time: 1784:46:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Well, yeah, well, I'd like to. I'd like to better understand what the win is and also understand what the trade off is. Because if we do shift to general fund, then there are trade offs with other programming and around class Sizes around what's offered, what supports for our students. And I was pretty concerned when we had the Facility and Operations Committee meeting about the amount of money that was being projected that we need to put in the bond.

start time: 1827:00:50.000
end time: 1854:53:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So we had a policy committee meeting in which we. I'm not going to give a long report because we've already had a discussion about much of it. But we're focused on landing a policy by later this fall. It will be challenging just given the timing of our meetings and our work sessions. And we have plans to solicit inputs not just from students, do focus groups, also with the three schools that already that will be implementing an enforcement tool, but also how do we solicit input from families, parents and our labor partners. And I encourage what I would encourage people to do just given the accelerated timeline for if you're not on the policy committee or if you're on it, to send any concerns you have about language or suggestions you have in advance so that we consider them. Because otherwise it's going to be very hard to actually move this policy at the timeline that we've been asked to move it if we continue to have trailing comments. So there'll be an updated draft for the next policy committee meeting. Send it out, let people know that it's been posted. But people, you know, getting Comments beforehand so that we actually can discuss them at the meeting. And obviously everybody's welcome. But you can discuss them at the meeting will allow us to move more quickly. And even then, it's going to seem slow.

start time: 1855:33:50.000
end time: 1857:26:18.000
confidence: 0.95
G: I would just add, if we need the whole board at a policy committee, we may want to try and find a team when everyone's available.

start time: 1857:28:34.000
end time: 1857:32:42.000
confidence: 0.70
E: So.

start time: 1857:33:06.000
end time: 1861:29:10.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Because I may not. I mean, I hear what you're saying, but even if I provide comments, I may not be able to be there to explain them. So either maybe schedule it at a board meeting or work with Roseanne to find a time when the entire board can be there if that's important for moving the policy forward.

start time: 1861:36:50.000
end time: 1871:03:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So what I would say is, I guess that's each individual board members. If they are interested people, not actually have to come if they don't want to. I'm happy to schedule something. Again, it's going to be super challenging to continue to move at a pace just given when we're going to get student input and then when we have meetings when we can have first and second readings. And it seems like we have a lot of time, but actually, we really don't.

start time: 1871:39:50.000
end time: 1876:12:46.000
confidence: 0.97
G: I'm not sure I can be at the policy committee meeting, so I don't think it's appropriate for you to tell us that we have to be at your meeting. I think it's better to find a time that the entire board can be available, whether that's doing it at an actual board meeting that is scheduled or ensuring that we all, in fact, do have the time on our calendars.

start time: 1876:14:38.000
end time: 1878:47:20.000
confidence: 0.95

B: We're not going to rush it. I will say, and I appreciate, director Scott, your suggestion. And what I would suggest is probably it will be an. And we'll keep moving pieces forward and schedule times for the full board. If that's the desire. That's the desire of the board.

A: Okay. We have time set aside. We'll look for a time that all of us can discuss. And I know you have an advisor at home, director Scott, that would like to weigh in. You want to make sure you do your community engagement well on this project, clear stakeholder involved, an active and engaged stakeholder. No bias. We have a final resolution, 6947. Chair Wong, would you like to introduce this next item?

start time: 1897:49:30.000
end time: 1923:13:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yeah, thank you. I know there's a resolution and a statement about the three. We have three committees. I just want to reiterate that the. One of the committees just renamed, it's not a different committee committee. So the Facilities Operation Committee is renamed as the School Facilities Improvement and Oversight. The reason for that is just because, you know, there's been some confusion about the reach or the scope of work of facilities and operations, especially around the world operations. And we felt like this renaming kind of gives a more specific goal and a more specific role, especially to the public who may not understand what the purpose of these committees are. So with that said, we have the naming of three committees. We have the Policy Committee, which is chaired by, I am pointing, Director Brim Medworth to Chair, and with members directed DePass, Vice Chair DePass and Director Sullivan. The other two committees have not been filled yet and are to be determined. And part of that is because you all are incredibly busy during the summer, which is surprising. So I'll be in touch with people about that. Again filling that. But this resolution is just about establishing these committees. And so, yeah, if there's any questions, please let me know. Oh, I'm sorry. The other committees are Audit Committee, and I mentioned already the School Facilities Improvement Oversight.

start time: 1923:20:50.000
end time: 1952:10:20.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah. And the discussion that I had with Chair Wong had to do with really being clear about our roles as board members and wanting to kind of maintain this fidelity around, you know, policy development, approving a budget, valuing the superintendent and not much else. So thank you, Chair Wong. So the Policy Committee, the purpose is to create, update and change PPS Board policies to best serve our student success. This will be the only committee that meets regularly, the Audit Committee. The purpose of that and the goal of that is a committee required by Board policy to determine, oversee and review necessary audits to help improve the functioning of pps. This committee will meet on an as needed basis, however I can envision. We'll review the audit schedule and then I imagine we'll get a second meeting towards the end of the year to get an update on any audits that are on that schedule. Then finally, the School Facilities Improvement Oversight Committee, which does not lend itself to an acronym very well. I can't even say it. The purpose of that is to oversee the spending on bond funds and capital improvements, provide a venue for in depth, in depth discussions on facilities and Upcoming potential decisions on facilities. That committee will meet on an as needed or ad hoc basis as well. Before we get to any board discussion, we should put the motion on the table. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt Resolution 6947 Resolution to establish the Portland Public Schools standing committees for the 2425 school school year?

A: Yeah. Scott and Hollins again to round. This is our final. Our final resolution. Is there any board discussion?

start time: 1957:34:00.000
end time: 1963:30:30.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Not in regards to these three. I know that we used to have the charter school and alternatives school committee and there was some legal business that I know that we had to do for, like on any upcoming charter schools. They had different things that had to be done around a certain time. What committee is handling that now?

start time: 1964:51:30.000
end time: 1980:33:10.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Question. Really, really good question. I asked the same question too, when we discussed this with leadership and it was brought that the. So in terms of renewal of charter schools this year, it's not. We don't have any required renewals this year, as I understand correctly. The other thing is that there's nothing stopping us from creating more committees as needed. One of the things I want to be very intentional is that when we create a committee, the goal needs to come first. Right. So the outcome or. Or the work that needs to be finished, that needs to be established first. And then if, for example, we do need a charter school oversight committee or things like that, you know, and establishing the goal of like, you know, this is the purpose of this committee, establishing a timeline and a result that we are expecting, then there's nothing stopping us from creating committees as needed. And that was kind of the solution that we came up with. And hopefully that answers your question.

start time: 1980:49:50.000
end time: 2008:49:20.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So it does. In regards of the legality around the charter schools. And I'm just assuming that what that means is that next year, if we got stuff coming up, then we'll have to establish a committee so that we can manage those. So then that would lead me to the other part of that committee, which is the alternative schools, which already feel like they're the stepchild of the district because they don't get the same attention, they don't get the same looks, they don't get the same access, they don't get the same exposure as our district traditional schools, and yet they play a significant role in supporting our district and the students that need the those schools. So the committee became a space. And I'm bringing this up as a means to bring it up. I don't want to chair the committee. I'm starting it out there just in Case somebody's saying, you throwing this out there, that means you got to start it. No, bro, that's not what this is. What I'm. What I'm trying to bring attention to is that if we disband the committee, then what are we putting in place so that those groups, those organizations, Those schools, those CBOs, those partners, those other organizations that are serving our students, because these are still our students, that they have a voice. So where do they get to go to have their. To have their voice to regularly bring up things that are of a concern to them, to regularly talk about the things that are important to them if they don't have the committee?

start time: 2009:54:30.000
end time: 2011:19:30.000
confidence: 0.94
A: That's a good question. Did you want to respond, Chair Wong?

start time: 2011:51:50.000
end time: 2031:24:30.000
confidence: 0.92
E: I really love that, Director Green. I think it is the work of the entire board to make sure that we are moving towards our board goals and especially the improvement of the experiences of our black native and. And Pacific Islander groups and students. So I think that is something that. To answer your point, my gut reaction right now is that that's the work of the whole board because it's that important. If the other answer to the question is, you know, looking upon last year at the committees especially, you know, I expect you're referring to students to test committee, you know, and as I reflected upon the work of the students test Me, which I chaired, when I was asking that question about, you know, was this serving students? Was this not in the. It was a big question mark. And I think that that's where the decision to. We're not disbanding it, but I think the idea is that we're putting at whole. And so if it is needed, if there's a need that arise and there's a very distinct purpose, like for example, we need something additional outside the board work, I'd be happy to consider re establishing it.

start time: 2031:41:30.000
end time: 2045:21:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Actually, I think the committee he was referring to was the charters and alternative school Committee, which is different from the student success committee. And they basically functioned in years in which we had charter applications. They spent. Thank you, Director Green. Significant amount of time reviewing the charter and making a recommendation to the full board. And it's good we don't have that this year because for the full board to do that would be a very significant amount of time. But he's referring to the other piece of it, which is all the alternative schools, which don't really usually have a place in our board discussions or our board meetings, and they sometimes have different and unique needs.

start time: 2045:43:30.000
end time: 2086:16:50.000
confidence: 0.95
F: The reason I was bringing it up is because the some of the. Some of the members of those other. Those other groups have reached. Had reached out that we already were feeling outcast last year because we actually didn't have this committee last year. We didn't have the charter and alternative school committee last year. And as a result, there were several things that they wanted to bring up, you know, that they wanted to talk about special. Special education being one of them, and you know what that looks like. And they didn't have a space or they didn't feel that they had a regular space where they could bring up some of their concerns, where they could walk it through, you know, walk that dog and get that. Get that information. Information out there or get the new stuff. And what I'm. What I'm trying to figure out is if we're continuing to move down the road of saying, you know, of like, well, we're gonna do these, because these are prominent. I'm. I'm thinking about the ones who already feel like they don't have a voice. So what are we intentionally. How are we intentionally. I understand this the job of the whole board, and I'm never go. I feel like it's the job of the whole board to care for every school in the district. And, you know, forget the zones, you know, because when I. When I'm on the board, I don't just represent just my students. I represent the entire district. I am the district. And so I totally get that. And it's with that. It's with that in mind that I'm bringing up this. This issue because. Because I am the district, and the alternative schools are also part of the district. They're part of our responsibility, and they don't feel as though they're getting the same level of love. So all I'm saying is we need to be intentional. Nothing is done if it's not done with intentionality. So we need to intentionally figure out something where we can reach out to our alternative schools and our charter schools to say, hey, listen, I understand that we have disbanded or we have paused the committee for this year. However, the pathway to. If they're. What is that for them? And we need to lay that out. So this is plain as day where there is no order. People will create it, and we need to be the ones creating the order.

confidence: 0.97
D: Yeah, I appreciate the question. If I may just jump in here really quickly and say that I'd love to hear more at a later time about the functions that was completed in those committees. I do believe that we have our chief of schools. We have our chief of student support services, we'd like to think that we're able to respond, but from a governance level, if there were some functions that address some of the needs of alternative school, I think if we're able to list those out, maybe we can help create a communication plan and some more details on how we'll provide wraparound service. And then some things just might need board action. But I don't know if I'm clear on what all those items are in this moment.

B: So I have a question for Director Huang. You said that the Facilities Oversight Committee or something close to that would have essentially the same function as the Facilities and Operations Committee in terms of scope, but you're just changing the name. Did I hear you say that correctly?

start time: 2109:10:10.000
end time: 2109:23:10.000
confidence: 0.90
E: Yes.

start time: 2109:31:30.000
end time: 2113:57:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So things like any like enrollment of boundary changes, the budget calendar, the curriculum and the bond, quarterly financial reports, that would all be in the potentially within the scope of that committee.

start time: 2114:38:10.000
end time: 2144:32:00.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Either. So I want to respond to Director Green first. Really quick. Let's talk. I want to hear your ideas. This resolution is not a once and for all for the rest of the year. It can be flexible. So if there's a need, let's talk and figure out how to address that need. And you know, this is again, like I said, this resolution is not in stone or it's not going to be the only committees for the rest of the year. It doesn't have to be. And that kind of leads into to Director Briermeyer, your question. If it is something, if that kind of, if that work that you're addressing is part of the work of looking at our bonds, the money spent, capital improvements. Yes, it can be in the facilities, School improvement Facilities and Operations Committee if it requires its own committee. I would actually prefer to do that because then the scope of its work would be specific, direct. And that's, that's, I think, kind of what we need in this board. We have to, you know, one of the things I want talk about and again we can talk about, hopefully talk about this one thing I want to bring up in our retreat, you know, and talk about effective governance. You know, we want to make sure that we're creating, you know, the needs are what's driving the creation of committees or things. Right. Instead of the other way around and having committees and then needing to, to fill time. And that's not necessarily respectful of or not respectful. It may not be the best use of time. And so that's kind of the idea again, if you have ideas and stuff, I'd love to talk. This is not set in stone. This is for now. If we need new committees to address these new issues, I'm all ears.

start time: 2144:37:50.000
end time: 2162:36:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Actually was going to ask a separate question about the bond, but the other ones were things that had been in the facilities and operations committees that if they all, if they all come to the full board, we're going to have lots of longer meetings or we're going to have to schedule like work time for a work session of the full committee. Versus I say just the topics I mentioned, like the budget, calendar, enrollment or boundary changes, curriculum, the bond, enterprise zones, quarterly financial reports that those would all have been things that went into the facility and operations committee. And so I'm just making sure that we're still sending them to committee. They're not just going to come straight to the board without more discussion. Because then generally those things then take way longer if they don't come, if they haven't been like worked in committee and just will have longer meetings. So is that re envision sort of same sort of scope but just different name?

start time: 2164:08:20.000
end time: 2172:35:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Yes and no. I would like to be specific on governance and basically what the name implies. But it's also a decision between the chair of the committee and the staff that they're working with what the scope is. If there is something that's big, that's going to require more than that, then we need to adjust. And that's simple as that. The need needs to drive the establishment of committees first.

start time: 2173:02:00.000
end time: 2211:10:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I guess I'm asking because the board has the authority to like create the committee. So I'm just trying to understand. I'll just state a concern I have. If those things aren't within the scope, then generally we'll need two meetings for substantive things versus the first time we see me a substantive item, we're voting on it, which isn't best practice. And generally those things have gone through the committee. So I'm concerned that I guess as long as we have two board meetings or two passes at it, or two work set, you know, work session and a board meeting before we vote or one before we vote, I'm okay with it. I just, I'll be concerned if we have things just coming straight to the board without any sort of board work or committee work. And then the second thing is I also want to make sure that we don't get started into the practice, which used to happen, which is small, small group meetings of board members that are in private and then something, all of A sudden pops out. I just don't think that's best practice. And it's also not an efficient use of a good use of I think board members time. Because then we've got the board meetings, the work sessions, and then we want to brief you on something that separately in a small group and not public. And frankly, when we have committee meetings, often somebody who's watching asks a question or they follow up or they want to weigh in. And so having just things have some sort of the antiseptic of being in public and it allows us to pressure test versus something coming straight to the board for a vote on its first sort of unveiling. So I'm just going to raise those two issues of concerns I would have. And I appreciate that you're saying you're going to be flexible. So then the other question I had is if we're going to meet the timeline for the bond referral, this board is going to have to do a fair amount of work this fall so that we have that sort of all baked and. And we have some big decisions to make. So is that in the facilities improvement or are you saying it's a different committee?

start time: 2211:53:50.000
end time: 2213:16:22.000
confidence: 0.89
E: The question for me, I don't know what's your vision?

start time: 2213:18:46.000
end time: 2218:59:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Would it be in that committee? Because like we need to start laying out a schedule so that we can back map it to actually, I mean the schedule to be harder than the local option to give ourselves enough time to have a package baked and to get the referral out there so we can build support for it.

start time: 2220:24:40.000
end time: 2227:41:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Was there a question? Oh, I think that's the. The bond work is the. One of the most important work of the board. So I think we need to talk about how best to move forward with the entire board and devote the amount of time it needs in order to succeed. So that is a definitely priority and so it's noted and we will definitely talk about it and make sure that we come up with a good solution to that.

C: I just want to thank you, Director Green, for raising those comments regarding alternative schools. I recall last year hearing from students who attended alternative schools, the sense of they feel like they're in the back burners of this district. You know, they want the same opportunities students at Grant Jefferson or McDaniels may have. And I really think it's important to really center their voices here. And I also want to acknowledge, you know, we've had a hard time at the district student council for years filling the positions at MLC alliance. And I believe there's one other alternative school. Yeah. And I really plan on really visiting to those schools to really ensuring that we have representation because I think those voices matter so much because they provide our students with so much resources and things. They really need to really not just kind of feel educated, but to really strive in their lives. So I really strongly urge this board and, you know, our superintendent to really center their voices in our conversations we have at the district level and the board level.

That's the first reading of policies. We've got the first reading of two policies. Revision field trips, foreign travel and other off campus activities. 6.5 0.010 p. And to the promotion and retention of students. 4.2 0.101 p. Policies. Director Edwards, would you like to introduce those two policies?

start time: 2277:50:00.000
end time: 2310:39:15.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Sure. So these are two policies that we have had multiple committee meetings discussing and also receiving feedback. They both come recommended for a first reading from the committee. And just briefly, I'm going to start with the retention and promotion policy. In January 2023, the Board of Education modified the compulsory enrollment, age and grade level and entrance board policy. This modification eliminated our practice of offering early entry to kindergarten. It was brought to our attention that this board policy that we're considering tonight still contained language in support of early entry to kindergarten and we needed to modify that. And then in addition, reviewing the rest of the language in this policy, we are updating other provisions that are research based relating to student retention and acceleration. And I think it's important that we've also changed the word promotion to acceleration. The policy was too broad, allowing for subjectivity and potential bias in terms of either retention or acceleration. And so we've suggested a series of changes that you'll find posted and you'll also find a fair amount of other information that was included with the committee materials. In addition, we also the committee recommended revisions to field trips, foreign travel and other off campus activities. And this is something that in 2019, the policy was last changed to mitigate.

And when that happens, we will, you know, prioritize putting it on agenda. And so the point of this is so that we can be more collaborative in our decision making on what we're talking about and what we're working on. Thank you.

B: Okay. I actually ran this by Gary last year, but we sort of got really busy last year with all sorts of things happening. Didn't do it. But there is a board self assessment from ospi, OSPA that sounds like it would be really good. And it's just a 20. And I heard about this last year at the OSPA convention and I'm going to it again this weekend so I'll see if I can get some more information. But what they told me last year was it's only just a 20 minute survey for each board member and you can complete it online. Then there's a 90 minute public session where you set board goals and then somebody from OSPA comes to help kind of monitor that. But it sounds like it would be a really good thing for us. I think. So I'll find out more and maybe put that on the agenda sometime and I'll bring it next week.

And we talked about the bond and we talked about the 20 million that we're putting into the bond. That's about curriculum and the need for us to really evaluate our spending. And with that in mind. It is with that spirit in mind that I want to bring up the idea, the conversation around. I don't know if any of you have saw it, but I've been on the Internet and Beaverton, Beaverton built a school. Not in class, not in class, not in class, but Beaverton just. Well, they're in the process of building the state of the art high school and they're spending 268 or 200. And I was just looking at, it's less than $300 million. They're getting a state of the art high school. It's going to serve 1700 kids. It's going to have a track, it's going to have a softball field. I'm looking at it right now, I'm looking at the mock ups right now. It's going to have a softball field, it's going to have a baseball field, it's going to have some soccer in the middle, it's got tennis, it's got plenty of parking. I guess I don't know if they need enough. You never have enough parking. So it's probably an obscure amount of parking. And I'm bringing all this up because we're not talking about a school that's on the other side of the country. We're not talking about a school that's in New York, we're not talking about a school that's in the south. Because if you go to Texas with this kind of money, you can build like 13 schools. It's different, it's different down there, but we're talking about a school that's just over the bridge and they're able to build a school for $300 million or less than $300 million that's going to serve 16, 1700 students. And then here we are, we have $350 million on the books right now. I believe it is for Jeff. We just finished Lincoln at a little over 400 million and we're asking for another hundred. And maybe it wasn't 400. My number might be off. Okay, so it was, was it less than 268? No. So I guess what I'm trying to get to, I guess what I'm trying to get to is, is there a space for us to say we want to do some level of an audit on why our numbers are so high? Can we do a construction audit and can we bring in somebody that does that has a national understanding of what it takes to build a state of the art school? Because I guess if we're being fiduciary responsible for like. And that don't even make sense as I'm trying to put those words together. Fiduciarily responsible for the, for the funding that we have that our voters are given to us. What can we do and how do we set the standard and can we bring somebody else in to say either yes, it's going to cost 500 million and you need to get that other 150 million or no, tell the people what you go give them, I'm going to pay you 350 million, you go build me a school. And if you not, then it was good talking to you. I'm going to find somebody else that can and that they'll do it because if they can do it for 268 and not feel like they're losing out, they're celebrating this, they're talking about it. And according to the schedule, it's going to be done by like fall of 2026 and then fully completed by fall of 2027. We haven't even broke ground and we got $350 million. We ain't got a dirt, we ain't got a shovel in dirt, we ain't got a sign on the wall, we ain't got a banner. You know, I'm saying we could have went to copy pilot and made a banner or something that said that this is coming, we haven't done anything. And I'm not saying. And the other thing I guess I'm not saying is I don't think we take the 150 million out altogether. So I'm not suggesting that we research.

G: Okay, you've already saved money. That may not be there. To your point, it's a really good question to ask. I will tell you, having done large construction projects in this area, there are usually really good reasons to explain it, but not always. So your question is a good one. I would not start with bringing in a big audit firm doing a big audit for construction. I would start with asking our staff, can you take a look at what they did in Beaverton and can you crosswalk for us? What is it it that they were able to build? 1 is a school the size of ours. Are they building the 1600? Are they building all the amenities they have the same ED specs, the cost of land, like all those other things, right? Contribute to that cost, do that crosswalk. Let's see where the big gaps are. And then as a board, if there are big gaps that are explainable, we'll be like, oh, yeah, that's. And I want to be clear. Some of our board policies might be contributing to that cost. Right? Like our, our, our climate policy. Right. Is, you know, I don't know if this is, if this is greenhouse.

G: But I'm saying that. And then as a board, we can look at that crosswalk and say, are there areas we want to dig deeper? And it may, we may want to bring in an outside expert, but I don't think we need to start with an outside expert contract. I think we can ask our staff, because I'll bet you they can crosswalk this and give us some pretty good answers.

H: It's getting kind of late, and I, my mind is already going. So how about we just give direction to our superintendent to do what she needs to do as far as looking into cost savings or whatever she feels she needs to do in order for us to get the information we need to move forward. Does that sound good?

start time: 2897:03:10.000

confidence: 0.91
B: Everybody, just a question about that. Are you talking about the current high school modernization projects that have all been sort of, they've been signed off on? I'm just trying to make sure that we're directing the superintendent to do, because. Is it Cleveland? IDA B.

F: Wells, Cleveland and JEFF and I think what I'm looking at for me, as I look at this, again, we, we, we trying to save money. We want to know where every dollar is going. And again, if they say, at the end of the day, we got to spend this money, this what it is, then we spend it and we go out and I'll go out and campaign with you. I have no problem asking people for money. I just don't want to spend money unnecessarily that we don't need to spend. I guess that's what I'm trying to get to. So if we could get a state of the art School for 300 million or 350 million or less than that, then let's get it. Let's not give out. You know what I'm saying? $150 million because they tacking them.

F: I'm saying as a, as a frame of thought, let's make sure that what we're spending is what we need to spend. And if at the end of the day we come back and we say what we need, what we are spending is what we need to spend, then let's keep spending. If we come back and we say maybe we could have did this for a little bit less, then let's figure out how to do it for a little bit less. I am never minced with my words. I speak. I'm saying exactly what I need to say. I'm not implying, I'm not trying to say to some. If I, if I thought somebody wasn't doing something, I would say, you are spending money incorrectly, period. I have no problem saying it. I have no problem. It is what it is when I say it. And so what I'm trying to get to is, can we make sure.

E: Yeah. Maybe I should give more instruction. This is the difficulty of being online. I wish I was there. So the idea of this part of the segment is not to introduce new topics, is to see what's concerning our fellow board members, and then also for me to assess, like, how many, how much interest is behind it. Like, for example, I'm gonna, you know, the, the board self assessment that Director Sullivan brought up. That's something I'm very interested in. I sure a couple of people are interested. That's something that we're going to definitely focus on. Director Brim Edwards, I think you pointed out earlier about, you know, this is a perfect example. This is why I was hoping we could talk about this. When you talk about our spending on curriculum. Right. If that's something it sounds like you're very interested in, that there's, if there's a couple other people interested in it, then we, we would prioritize that onto the agenda. So the whole point of this is more Just the popcorn ideas and. And then at the end I would like to ask everybody if there's other ideas that other people have heard that they would also like to put their vote into for a potential future agenda topic. And I don't want it to be spending on discussing because I want to respect everyone's time and it's past people's bedtime. So if we can kind of redirect that one thing that. I'm just going to go now. One thing that's really important to me actually. It's late, I forgot.

A: I have two ideas written down. Director Brim Edwards would like to say a few items we'd like to know. It sounds like. Are there more than one person interested in a board self assessment? Just quick show of hands. 1, 2, 3, 4. So we've got five people, Fiduciary Financial, that's what I wrote down.

end time: 2975:29:34.000
confidence: 0.98
B: My first question is our process normally is that we send stuff into leadership for the agenda setting meeting. So is this now the replacement or should we also do that as well?

start time: 2975:32:22.000
end time: 2976:08:10.000
confidence: 0.91
A: I'll let Chair Wong answer that.

start time: 2976:53:10.000
end time: 2991:45:02.000
confidence: 0.95
E: You could do both. The only problem is if everyone just kind of does it solo and we don't like. One of the values of us being together is that we feed off each other's ideas. And that's kind of the whole point of this, this exercise. If something comes up later, yes, absolutely, send it in. And it is, you know, obviously it's going to be up to me to figure out, you know, solicit from other board members, you know, what, what their interest in this is. The whole point that the thing I'm trying to avoid is that, you know, if everyone sends like three separate ideas and they're all completely unrelated to each other, you know, how do you choose what's going to be on the agenda? So the whole point of this is to kind of share the voice so that we're all part of figuring out how to move forward. So yes, you can definitely, definitely send in. I am not going to, you know, I am always welcome to that.

start time: 2991:48:06.000
end time: 3000:07:48.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And we can also change our practices in real time. So I think what we're trying to get at with voicing what things are interested in is so it's not just one off if we each send in two items and we've got 14 items. We're trying to. If something rises to, you know, three board members interested, then we would put it on the agenda and it keeps us honed on our mission. But I would take it now and then you can also mail in.

start time: 3000:08:44.000
end time: 3000:52:20.000
confidence: 0.91
B: But when I'm going to get my list if I can.

start time: 3000:54:20.000
end time: 3002:06:00.000

A: Yes, absolutely. I'm just saying if you mail things in, then nobody else.

start time: 3002:25:40.000
end time: 3014:32:58.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, well, it's just what's in our protocols. That's what I'm just like. That's the process that we've had. So I'm just clarifying whether or not that was what we're doing. So I'm just going to say I'm with Herman and the hybrid from Herman and Andrew's ideas. I like Patty's. I'm really concerned that we don't have a board work plan. I don't think we, we should just be voting on like, hey, there's four people interested in talking about something because we're going to run out of time and we're going to have really late meetings. So I would suggest at our retreat we have a discussion about our work plan. So, you know, 70% of the work that we know we have to do, we know what it is right now and the other 30 will come to us. Yes.

start time: 3014:33:14.000
end time: 3015:10:34.000
confidence: 0.83
A: And I believe we have a draft starting.

start time: 3015:11:22.000
end time: 3015:52:10.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Well, nothing's been sent to the rest of the board, so. That's right.

start time: 3015:52:50.000
end time: 3016:15:10.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Because it's still in draft.

start time: 3016:42:10.000
end time: 3068:36:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Then the curriculum adoption. I think we have to nail this issue before we get going on the next bond. The tracker that was sent out, it said that we're going to have the superintendent's evaluation draft template on the 20th. So I just want to make sure that we get that 12 days in advance like any other material. And that there's also a draft process that gets us through the school year I've seen over the last five or six years. I think it's really unfair to the superintendent that we don't. If we don't. When we don't have like a structured process that the superintendent can expect, what are we looking at? How often are we going to touch base? Because if we wait to the end of the year, usually that's. I found in my professional life you don't want any surprises. So if we're going to do quarterly check ins, let's get that set and then calendared. But I would hope that the template comes also with the process. And it didn't say that also fairly soon we should have the auditor's evaluation because that's the other employee who reports to the board. This goes to the work plan. But I'd love to get a draft bond planning calendar and also a draft budget calendar knowing that we're going to have cuts. I think one of the things that Interim Superintendent Husk was like when you know you've got cuts coming, well, maybe, maybe the governor's plan is going to happen and it'll be smaller. But to get those front loaded versus at the end of the end of the year. So getting those two calendars built out into our larger work and also the early legislative agenda. I know that generally we don't adopt it until later in the fall, but we have lots of opportunities right now with people running for office to get at least some big bucket items in front of them or priorities that we can have conversations with candidates who are running and also before they commit their dollars to everything else. So I'd love to have that at least a board discussion on what we're going to do, at least on the funding side of things. And then the last item, and this is for just not now, but future discussion is like if we want to move policies like the cell phone policy, we really need to have when we switched our board meetings to having one board meeting a month and one work session and a work session with a consent agenda, you're going to have months between when something gets referred and actually it gets first and second read if we don't use both of our meetings for that. So just not for you now. But just I sent this in before but it's mainly a function of us changing how we our board meetings and that impact that then has on moving policy. Yeah. Because maybe we want to change the 21 day public comment period or something else, but it doesn't work very well right now.
