A: We have a couple things, few things on our agenda. Bond planning on the Whitaker site and Jefferson modernization. So I'm gonna just go a little bit out of order. I'm gonna just, just touch on the Whitaker stuff. Then we can go into the draft modernization stuff. So that way we can spend time on the bond planning and hopefully the other two will be here. But if not, our new standard is that we will be sharing our committee meetings with every board member so they have it. So they don't have no excuse of not seeing it or watching it or whatever they need to do to be informed. So this will go out to them directly as well. So we'll start with the Whitaker ADAM site. I just wanted to bring this back up. We put a proposal for a lease. Hey sir, what's going on with you? Proposal for a lease for use to. For my buying a sports program to build a sports complex on the land at this previously Whitaker ADAM site. It's a site that has been vacant for a little over 20 years now. And there was a proposal for at least a couple years ago. We kind of pulled back because we were looking at the residing of Tubman and we wanted to make sure that site was available for the middle school if that was the plan for it to be turned out it's not the plan for middle school to be on that lot. So I just wanted to kind of just reintroduce that proposal. And so what I'll be asking, not at this meeting, but I'll be asking this committee to. I'll be asking this committee to make a proposal for this to go to the full board so we can get a decision on that. I want to do it in two parts. I want to do the least piece first. I also want to look at how we can do this as a partnership with pps. I think there are some great things that's happening. I think the timing is right. There's some things that's happening in the city around sports and entertainment that I think could be beneficial for our kids here at pps. So I want to look at it as more of a partnership. And so that's kind of the stage that I want to bring it in. I will ask to send this to the full board at the next facilities operations meeting. I'm gonna have some things I want to introduce some additional information especially around when it comes to funding and things like that. And just so that these before board can make a decision one way or the other. So besides that, the next I'll hand.

Looking for us to really, like, think outside the box on things, be direct with people. This year. I learned a lot for the last couple of years that we've done this when we talked about things with facilities. So my. My charge for you, for us, is to. When we are talking with the public or talking with communities, that we just be direct with them as forward as possible, give them information that they need as far as the committee goals. I love slides that are five slides or less. I don't really need a whole lot of pictures and, you know, just five. Five slides or less would be great. I feel that, you know, folks should be able to say what they need to say, but within those five slides, we try to be on time and get out on time. I try to leave in an hour and a half most of the time. So if anybody have any questions about those or comments or suggestions, please keep them to yourself. I'm joking. All right. Okay, you're on.

We are going to come back and provide a comprehensive update of the Jefferson modernization here very soon. But sequence was some of the discussions that we're having. We're meeting with staff this week. We have a community event this week as well, focused on families and students. We won't be able to bring you that information. We just don't have that quite yet. So today we didn't want to certainly ignore the project. So we want to give a quick verbal update on answer questions that you might have and then we'll be back at the next meeting or sooner, if you'd like to bring us back sooner as well. So with that, I will turn over to Maria.

D: Thank you. He stole all of my funder. That was pretty much really. It's just to walk you through some of the things that we talked in the memo about at the time that we met the last Facilities and Operations Committee. We in the project, we're just starting to dig into the cost estimating of the schematic design set of drawings. Schematic design is the earliest phase of design after comprehensive planning. It's the piece where we start to flesh out through the general sizes and adjacencies that we had developed in the planning process. We were fortunate to have our contractor on board, newly on board at that point to give us their logistical expertise, but also their conversations with subcontractors and other contractors about market costs and conditions. As part of that process, we were doing those cost estimates. We got them back. They came back significantly higher than our budget. Fortunately, we already had a value engineering workshop that we had scheduled. This is something we do as a standard part of our modernizations, typically during schematic design, because that is when we have the most ability, ability to impact the design and cost moving forward. We already had planned that. You know, generally speaking, with those, we bring together our design team, all of their sub consultants, our contractor, any subcontractors that they have on board, our project team, our internal stakeholders who are talking to folks from maintenance, from security, from all the folks that really need to have some input into design. And we sit down and we talk through, you know, sort of what our values are for the project. We prioritize those values. So as we talk through cost reduction options, ensure that what we're reducing costs are we are keeping and prioritizing those values. For this particular value engineering workshop, we also brought in community members. Because this has been such a community led process, it was really important for us to ensure that they continue to be part of these conversations. And this is a significant impact to the project that we were talking about. So we brought in some of our folks from our design advisory group, as well as community members who have been working with Colocate, which is our community engagement firm that has been us get messages back and forth between community members and community groups and those of us that are sort of sitting in the trenches of the project. So I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about the workshop. It was very intensive. We spent a week there, a lot of people in the room and a lot of conversations. What I'll say is that it became really clear that the most significant driver of costs to this project was the fact that we were trying to keep students on site during construction. And, you know, to talk a little bit about that, what we were doing is we were going to keep them on site in what we call the 1909 building, which is the building that most people think of when they think of Jefferson. And it's the primary building on site that 1909. We say 1909, that's when it was built. It's unreinforced masonry, four stories. And what we were attempting to do was to build new buildings adjacent to that while we kept students in the 1909 structure, then move them into the new buildings so that we could go back into that building and do all the things to it that we needed to do to support it, to bring in new systems and to create new spaces. That essentially led to some challenges for us from a cost perspective. First of all, when you're phasing construction, you're shifting students. So we're constantly having to think about what spaces they have access to, what they need in order to maintain their academic programming. We also have to think about protecting them. So this played out in a couple ways. We determined, with the assistance of our contractor, that supporting that 1909 structure during construction from a. From a structural load perspective was going to be very, very complicated and very, very expensive. Unreinforced masonry, four stories. This is a building that already needs additional support. And we were essentially looking at digging out right next to it. And we were going to keep students and staffing. Doing that to do that safely was. It was quite a bit. And I think it really took us having our contractors expertise on the project to understand what the implications of that would be. In addition to that, the fact that we were moving students around and having to maintain spaces for them where they could get their full academic programming, no matter where they were, meant that we had a really inefficient layout for spaces. So when they were in the 1909 building, we needed to make sure they had everything. When we moved them into the new building, we had to make sure they had everything. Science classrooms, arts classrooms, theater spaces. All those things had to be recreated across two different spaces, which meant ultimately it was really inefficient and we were adding square footage to the new building in particular in order to accommodate these needs that we wouldn't have to do across the site as a whole. So it just became very obvious that the only way for us to move the project forward on budget was to not maintain students on site. We've spent the last several weeks looking at relocation options. When we say relocation, that is synonymous with swing sites. We use both those terms. So you'll hear us say swing or swing site. That means moving them off site to another location to continue their education. While we're doing the construction, we looked at several options. We've been discussing them with stakeholders. We have determined at this point that the Marshall campus is the best option for a swing site in order to address academics, athletics and existing partnerships. We are communicating that through various means at the moment. We've. We have had conversations with our internal steering committee, with our design advisory group. We have a Jefferson staff meeting coming up on Wednesday morning. On Wednesday evening, we will be meeting with families and students from the Jefferson community and from Jefferson cluster schools.

D: Wednesday, 6pm in the library. We will also be meeting with our Bond Accountability Committee next Monday. We'll be presenting the same information to them there. And we are going to continue working through what this means in terms of swinging to Marshall. When I say what this means, we have a. We have a lot of folks who have questions about some very particular things. I won't get through a lot of those details, but just a note. The middle college program, sorry, it's a partnership more than a program, to be clear, that will be integrated at the Marshall campus. The details of that we are working through. We're working through that with pcc. So we will make sure that that continues. It may continue in multiple iterations and so ask that everybody be flexible, make it work with the site that it's in. So we will look at PCC campuses that are closer to, as opposed to transporting students to the campus closest to Jefferson. We want to make sure that what we're doing is in the best interest of students. So we'll be looking through those details, working with PCC on those. We are also working on transportation. We will be providing transportation for students to Marshall as well as transportation for middle college activities, for after school activities with SEI and other partners. We will have more information on that as we work through that. But again, it's a lot of work in progress as we understand where students are coming from, where they need to go to and how we can best get them there. We do recognize that this is not what anyone hoped for. I think we all tried very, very hard to keep students on site, did everything we could until we realized it simply wasn't going to be possible. And so now we are listening very carefully to families and students and staff about the concerns that they have and trying to figure out how we can best support everyone during the transition. We're also continuing to look forward to having a really beautiful, state of the art modernized Jefferson. And I don't want to lose sight of that either. We anticipate the change in phasing. We will have students occupying the new modernized school in November of 2027. It's actually a year earlier than we would have been complete phased approach. So we're very happy that we were able to shorten the construction period from four years to three and get students and we are going to continue moving forward with all of the design work that we're currently doing, working very closely with our partners at the city anticipating permits. So we have a special process that we're working through with the city that they are partnering with us to prioritize Jefferson and the permitting process. And we are very appreciative of the work that they're doing to help us. And you know, we will also be working through all the logistics for the, for the swing site. So that is a big priority for us. And those meetings are going to intensify. Those details are going to be coming at us very fast. We're going to be communicating this out and having conversations and DAG meetings will continue. Town halls are being planned for upcoming as well. And we continue to send out emails to the community.

C: And then at that, my last suit questions. I'm a little bit concerned that the cost doubled. I mean, I know it's back to where it was, but were you surprised by that or what? How did we miss that when we initially talked about keeping students on site and the cost? Or is it.

start time: 350:26:00.000
end time: 361:24:00.000
confidence: 0.94
D: It's a fair question. It's one we've asked ourselves a lot too. I think, you know, the challenge is we've never tried to support four stories of unreinforced masonry from literally right next door. We're not talking, you know, like a straightaway the logistics of doing that and working around the construction site with that kind of support. We're so great. I don't know that we could have anticipated what that means. We were so focused on really trying to honor that desire to have students stay on site.

start time: 361:45:00.000
end time: 366:04:52.000
confidence: 0.94
C: And then to request, could you add Roosevelt High School and Franklin High School to the cost per square foot, just so we have all the high schools on it. I notice it started with, I think Grant versus the first.

start time: 366:07:56.000
end time: 366:34:28.000

C: Yeah, there's a chart that has that.

start time: 367:18:04.000
end time: 370:21:56.000
confidence: 0.95
D: But we didn't necessarily intend. We sort of started at one point because we really need to stay really close, but happy to go back.

start time: 370:24:28.000
end time: 376:21:20.000
confidence: 0.94
C: And then the last question is if we move it off site. Because my understanding of the long term staging was with Jefferson saying on site that you actually we could get started earlier with Cleveland or Ida B. Wells because they're also swinging in there. So what impact does it have on those. I'm channeling.

start time: 376:28:20.000
end time: 376:36:12.000
confidence: 0.58
D: Yes.

start time: 376:37:16.000
end time: 377:11:56.000

C: The Cleveland community and the Andrew Forbes.

start time: 377:13:48.000
end time: 402:08:52.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Yeah, of course. And we're having those conversations internally as well. Ida B. Wells, you know the conversation we had during the conceptual master planning process prior to it being put on the farm measure, we anticipated they would have to swing on site similar to how Lincoln did it. And in large part that's because of the layout of their site, the opportunities we have available there, the challenges of timing, etc. So there were a number of things that we kind of looked at with Cleveland. We were very hopeful it would swing to Marshall as sort of the baseline for the cost estimates we put together for the bond measure. Now, like everything that was done during the conceptual master planning as a baseline, when we go back through the comprehensive planning process, we will go back and truth all of the assumptions that went into that. And I think one of the things that we came across with Cleveland as we were doing the conceptual planning is that we're potentially multiple options for how we might move forward with the modernized Cleveland. Those are options we need to spend more time with. We are starting that comprehensive planning process right now. There are other options out there that may make sense for Cleveland.

confidence: 0.96
E: No. I think it is a great idea. Roosevelt stayed on site and it was trash. And so I'm not. I'm not really. I was never really in favor for Jeff to be on site because I felt they got a shabby job and I didn't want the two black schools and the students of color to get a school that was not done well. And me and Dan have had this conversation, so I know Dan did a great job. Dan, this is Not a nod to you, but yeah. So I feel like this should have been the option. We should have been trying to figure out how to work through and how to get to. Oftentimes until you've actually gone through it, you don't realize all the effort that it takes to try to keep a student on site and do construction work at the same time. You're limited in what type of construction can be done during certain hours because of all the fact that you have kids there. The type of machinery and equipment that you have to have on site. All those different things change the game on what you can actually do, which in turn extend the amount of time you're going to be doing the work that you're. You're doing. And when your heart is in, it's just like, no, I want my kids to stay. No, I don't want them to be moved. What if they don't want to come back? People are going to come back. They're going to come back. It is what it is. I respect everybody's ideas, concepts, thoughts around why this is important. At the end of the day though, I want to make sure that we get a school that's not going to be subpar. That no, no stones are like left unturned. I want us to look at every single solitary thing and I want to make sure that when they walk away from that school that there's absolutely nothing that they can, they have to hold their head down about. I want them to be walking through saying this is the University of Jefferson versus you know, like they gave us a school. It, it has to be top notch. It just has to be. So I say let's hurry up and get to it so that we can figure out what we go do with Cleveland and their, their attachment to their bricks.

confidence: 0.95
D: So students would move out of Marshall back to Jefferson over the summer of 2027. So they starting school which would free the Marshall campus at that point. However, it May be that the Marshall campus is not the best option. And I think that is the piece that we have to go through this planning process and identify what we're doing in order to identify where students are. It also determines the timeline.

end time: 467:06:30.000

end time: 500:35:20.000
confidence: 0.93
D: For Jefferson, yes. There were other options that we looked at for relocation. We had some limitations on what we could look at based on zoning. So it's one of the constraints that always points us when we're looking to move an entire school somewhere. We initially looked at pcc. That was something that was a very popular suggestion that we already have students going over to PCC to take classes as part of the college partnership. Why couldn't we just move the entire school over there? Their zoning does not allow it and there are no exceptions to that. So call that a fails law. And we also looked at Kenton, which is a site now, there's a former elementary school. It does not have the right types of spaces. We might have been able to fit the number of students, but we would not have been able to accommodate the programming for academics because it doesn't have science classrooms that we need. It doesn't have the arts classrooms that we need. It doesn't have cte, dance program, et cetera. There were a number of really unique spaces that we didn't have. If you can't meet the educational program of students, it's not a good site for students to go to. So we recognize people. It's very appealing. But we also really need students to have their full educational experience during the time. But the construction's occurring. So those are the other two sites that we looked at. Marshall really is the best option from an education perspective. Gives us everything we need. Athletics space for our partners. The biggest challenge for the fact that it is farther.

confidence: 0.93
A: I just wanted to make sure we got into that because that's really something important. After that. After this as well. Our goal is to come up with a subcommittee for the bond program so we can have a committee that's just focusing on the bond work. So we potentially have two meetings, one for bond only and then a regular FO committee stuff. That's the goal.

B: Density sharing, right? Okay, next topic is bomb planning. We do have more than five slides. I do plan for those. It's high level. It's also dense. I mean, we can really get into a lot of details here. The intent is this is our first conversation about BOM planning. I'm really just hoping to introduce some topics and get into a lot of them later. But you know, at least get some. Some thought going about some of some of the topics and also just provide like a really big broad overview for those who haven't been through this process before. I certainly some have. So I want to go through pretty quickly. Please stop be during it if there's questions. Totally happy to do that. This isn't overly formal. So talking about bond planning, general obligation bond planning, really what this process is is just making a series of decision over time and then revisiting those decisions over time. It's very much an iterative process. And our intent through this process is that decisions that are made by the board are informed decisions. You have data from staff, you have community input, et cetera. And the presumptive that will confirm date of the bond would be November of 2024. So the big decisions to make are when to go out for the bond. Confirm that that's the right time, what's the size of the Bond, how big is it, the dollar amount and then what is the scope and the priorities that go into that bond. Ultimately, the board will refer the bond to voters and voters will make that decision. And during all this process we will have community engagement and the bond accountability committee plays a role as well. High level how we're thinking about walking through this process, but we're happy to take feedback and pivot as necessary is for the first couple meetings to be pretty high level. Introduce some concepts and some important components that go into decision making around general obligation bonds and then get into the real specifics. Sort of nitty gritty with focus on things like the long range facilities plan, ADA plan, the decarbonization plan, security, seismic improvements, prioritization, that sort of stuff. And take these pieces as a time as we start to build sample bonds. So that's sort of the high level idea. When we get through this, you can tell me if you think that's a good question.

start time: 575:50:54.000
end time: 588:25:28.000
confidence: 0.93
C: In 2012 and in 2017, there was, it wasn't community engagement, but there was a community served on the bond Stakeholder advisory group, the BSAG in 2016. And it actually was a nice broad cross section of the community. Not just parents, but also people with expertise and they were helpful in shaping and bringing additional expertise and insights and then also in passing the bond. I'm curious, I mean both, both times that happened, I was curious that I'm not seeing that here and I know we didn't do that in 2020, but that was more because of the pandemic and.

start time: 588:26:24.000

start time: 588:38:08.000
end time: 593:33:14.000
confidence: 0.96
C: You just couldn't have a meeting. But yeah, back to like, you know, we were able to pull in a great group of people who provided, you know, did a lot of the work in terms of. Than when we actually had referred it to the voters were engaged.

start time: 593:35:22.000
end time: 598:50:18.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Yeah, no, I agree. I think that was a good model and I do think we'll do something similar then we haven't had time to put really that plan together and so that input is helpful. I think one of the things you're meeting to. I left off here was to talk about that engagement plan. So come back and have something a little more detailed out to see if that's meeting what the committee thinks is the right approach. I think, I think, yeah.

start time: 598:50:34.000
end time: 601:07:00.000
confidence: 0.87
C: So it's like less than engagement, like getting people's one off, but really having help build it and bring some expertise and then get it up.

start time: 601:12:00.000
end time: 644:17:20.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, I do think it's a. I think it worked well both in 2012 and 2017. Super high level Y bonds, you know, general obligation bonds are revenue that we can get that doesn't pack general fund. The district has very significant capital needs well into the billions of dollars and capital revenue. The general fund or other sources such as grants or otherwise are pretty minimal on an annual basis. So general obligation bonds are really our opportunity for significant capital and to address the capital needs district has. Typically when we talk about bonds, we break them down into categories of work because it's just helpful to have these conversations. So we talk about physical facility improvements. Think of that as like fixing broken versus educational improvements, which is more like curriculum and technology and providing modern classroom environments. Capacity is building new capacity where we might need it or augmenting capacity where we might need it. And then modernizations are effectively a combination of all anticipate as we do this process because we have a long term capital improvement plan and these are really a series of bonds. There will be questions about how previous scopes of work were prioritized. And so I think it's just good to surface. There are guiding documents, some that date back over a decade, like our original long range facilities plan that helped guide the first two or three bonds. And things that those included were like focus the majority of the funds on modernizations because that's the most efficient use of funds. Start modernizing with the high schools, then saving some some funds for the highest facility needs. We also anticipate, and people bring up regularly in these conversations what we called our sustainable financing. And what this was was a model of how to maintain revenue over decades through a series of general obligation bonds. So to keep a long term, multi decade, multi billion dollar capital improvement program going. And at the very high level, the reason that we're that and I bring this up, the reason that people sort of defer to 2024 is because of this plan. They think back to this plan somewhere, sometimes called the subway tile plan. Say it's oh, every four years. This is, this is the model that the district is following. And we'll, we'll talk more about the principles and why that plan made sense and sort of where we are now and go along.

start time: 644:42:20.000
end time: 645:40:52.000
confidence: 0.86
A: Have there been any deviations because of COVID into that plan?

start time: 645:43:56.000
end time: 691:45:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: There definitely have been deviations from those plans. That's why I put like an example on here. I think people remember this visual but because of the, you know, the sequence of bonds, it's not this clean anymore. How the debt financing works. And when we get into that conversation, I will definitely have to bring in finance people that are a lot smarter than soon Someone says something like tranche, I am out of the conversation. I don't talk anymore. We also have more recent guiding documents such as our facility condition assessment that was completed in 2020 and our long range facilities plan in 2021. The intention is that, you know, we will bring, you know, we'll have more detailed conversations about these documents as we get into building of these sample bonds. And then of course, we have a track record already of three bonds that have been passed in the last decade with you know, pretty impressive approval rating in the 2020 bond, this 95% approval. So when I. The next two topics, the financing and timing, are really quick, but I'll just pause if there's any specific questions so far. Okay, we will definitely, as we go through this process, we'll constantly talk about the financing and how the impact of financing or the terms of financing impact this bond and potentially future bonds, high level bonds or loans. So we can think of bonds. You know something, this is the simple way. And I don't know if finance people will kick me for comparing it to like a conventional mortgage, but the idea of these are loans. So bonds, when we issue bonds, they have insurance. And if you have long term bonds or long term loans, the amount of interest you pay compared to principal is high. If it's short term, they're much lower. So it's just think about that because when we start to get into, when we start saying what's the right size of the bond, we'll start having conversations about the amount of principal compared to interest. And then this is again more of the same thing. The sustainable financing plan. Really the tenants of that, if you, if you do pay as you go these short term bonds, you take manageable bites. Then you can cap your tax rate after the second issue bond just into the bond group bond and third, fourth and subsequent bonds you can refer to as a renewal because you're retiring debt at the same time you're asking voters for new debt. I realize that probably just sounds like a bunch of words, but I swear it will come back later when we bring in our financial advisors.

start time: 692:06:50.000
end time: 697:05:56.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Okay, that's one question about that. So we're talking about, we're talking about our second bond, which over 700 some million 790. So are you saying that we haven't fit? I mean every bond after the 1.2 will be at the 790 or that that rate, the tax rate would be.

start time: 697:07:08.000
end time: 697:20:36.000
confidence: 0.99
B: It's the rate.

start time: 697:21:48.000
end time: 697:32:04.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Okay.

start time: 697:34:12.000
end time: 704:15:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Right. So the, so the, the subway tile has that the, the x axis, the Vertical. What that is trying to show is the tax rate and saying if you follow a plan like this, after your second bond, that will be the top of your tax rate. So that third bond slides in there because you are retiring debt at the same time you're asking debt.

start time: 704:47:20.000
end time: 708:53:50.000
confidence: 0.94
C: And so if we went out again in November of 2024 with a renewal, do we have understanding of how much that would raise?

start time: 709:16:50.000
end time: 728:45:14.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Good question. And these are the ones we're going to want our financial advisors to come in and kind of present. And I'm thinking of the form of printing like kind of small, medium, large. Because the bond debt structure we have now is not primarily short term. A lot of it is long term. So when we think of the very first bond in 2012, the district didn't have any capital debt. That's the right term, but didn't have any debt. We're paying against general obligation bonds. So it was a clean slate. So there was no existing regular payments to think about to go against that taxable value that that comes in. We now have debt, so it's not a clean slate. So when we look at a 2024 bond, we need to think the revenue that's coming in is already paying for debt, debt that we've issued. So the question is, do we have enough to get what we want with just a renewal or do we consider increasing or consider longer debt? And then I think really the question is, is 2028 realistic if we do.

start time: 728:46:42.000
end time: 730:38:34.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Longer debt, if we following the next cycle, 29 or 30 or something.

start time: 730:41:22.000
end time: 731:37:14.000
confidence: 0.82
C: I think Carol recommended or mentioned six year.

start time: 731:40:02.000
end time: 745:32:50.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Carol has. Yeah. With Piper Jaffe, our financial advisors has talked about considering how the debt is. And I won't speak for her, she's way smarter than me. But you might consider getting, getting off that sequence, which is I think like a quick segue to timing about when we think about the timing of the bond, I submit we want to think not just of this one, but that next think about this bond, the upcoming bond and the over capital program and things that will come in to play. Well, how will this one affect future ones? Also, how much existing work do you have if you go to 2024? Where are you with your current work and how much money you have and do you need to go out that. And I honestly think that's less of a conversation about 2024 than is 2020. I think I said one more.

start time: 745:43:10.000
end time: 746:07:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: That's the same one.

start time: 746:25:50.000
end time: 761:35:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I don't know why I did that or I just did on accident. So that's really in the Presentation in some feedback that any feedback that you have for staff is helpful. One thing that, you know, we're sort of curious about is are, are there initial priorities you think that you think will need to be in a 2021 or you know, kind of a top tier consideration, whether that be categories of work or these are just different types of work that fit within those categories and those categories aren't. That's a wavy line. It's a hard line. But these are some things that we certainly, we know we need to address or. And then you know, that we've, we've also heard about. So I'll stop there, see if there's any other questions. Feedback. I have.

C: Since I'm going to go back to one of the early pages. One thing I didn't see on here, I mean it's a pretty standard list of all the capital needs we have is air conditioning. Moving up your, your list of items is not on here. I know we spent a lot on ventilation, but I'm curious. I say everything else are things that I think are pretty standard.

start time: 771:44:50.000
end time: 785:29:48.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, we do, we do. We do think about air conditioning solver Neumannization of air conditioning and all of our H Vac replacements or mechanical system replacements that we're doing now. Heat is the bigger concern because one, we're in school longer during the, during the winter and so heat is actually our number one work order, number one lack of heat. But those come together. So updated mechanical system also has air conditioning. Smaller scale air conditioning is really challenging. Like the local units, the window units, that type of stuff we were looking at. Actually lots of different options do that. But really the best way for mechanical cooling is to replace the whole system. From a capital perspective, for sure. Does that answer your question? Yeah.

start time: 785:30:04.000
end time: 787:58:20.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So it would be. Well, yes, it's on your radar screen. You're thinking about it. So when we see an H Vac upgrade usually does.

B: That means that air conditioning comes with it. So when it's a replacement. Absolutely. Sometimes we might say we're doing H Vac improvements. You use H Vac shorthand, mechanical. Even if there's not air conditioning in it. It's just short term that people use. But if we're doing a mechanical system replacement, any of our new schools, they, they have air conditioning.

start time: 793:50:50.000
end time: 797:12:50.000
confidence: 0.91
C: That's part one of the things that I'd be interested in seeing what the list of schools I have, besides all the new high schools and Then overlaying it with the Portland heat map.

start time: 797:14:10.000
end time: 797:30:58.000

B: So the.

start time: 797:33:14.000
end time: 803:11:30.000
confidence: 0.91
C: Those schools that are in sort of the 82nd to 205 corridor, a lot fewer trees, hotter. Same thing with all the schools around down I5. And just where we have air conditioning. Just because those schools are a lot hotter than if you're sitting shaded.

start time: 803:14:10.000
end time: 814:17:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yeah, that's a great suggestion. We'll do that for two reasons. One just tied to where we have air conditioning, which isn't very many schools. I think it's cousin ish. And also we're piloting different programs to try and cool schools with different ways. And I won't go to details there, but we don't have a lot of data either which schools are the hotter schools or which classroom. So it's pretty anecdotal data we have now. So we're trying to figure out better ways of where are those actually more uncomfortable spaces. So we can try to target our. These pilots that we're trying to do that they're ultimately the improvement. If it's a window film or something else, then that works well, yeah, we'll do that.

confidence: 0.88
C: And this is Nikki for you. Gary is what do you envision as the process? Because there's always like billions of dollars and then we're going to go through our prioritization process because usually that's how, you know, everybody. Their project should be in the list. So I'm curious how we're gonna. How you're gonna lead that.

start time: 824:15:10.000
end time: 836:50:50.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yes, I think that's when we bring in the bond subcommittee to kind of look at how do we start once we get all the stuff together, how do we start prioritizing, you know, things want to suggest. We'll be looking at stuff that's going to first directly affect kids. Right. So like athletics. Right. Even though that directly affects kids, you know, and then just kind of look at it, just a suggestion, you know, of looking at it that way, like how it's going to directly affect our kids. First needs that we have to do, like ADA accessibility needs, you know, so looking at it in those type of ways. But I think that's something when we have the subcommittee kind of go over how to prioritize. But that'd be. That'd be my suggestion if I'm on that or not.

start time: 837:46:30.000
end time: 838:07:58.000

D: This is.

start time: 838:53:10.000
end time: 853:52:02.000
confidence: 0.94
C: A question. But two years ago, I think put money in the budget and we did for a bond report to the community was after the water crisis, but the paint and everything else and the actually most of the report to the community focused on the modernizations which are polling showed was not the main. That wasn't the reason why people passed the I mean the schools are beautiful, but people really voted for the bond because of the 150 million for health and safety and health, safety and accessibility. And so I'm wondering about just as I look through this timeline, if we have an opportunity to communicate really specifically to the broader community about the upgrades that have been made say so so.

start time: 853:52:26.000
end time: 854:37:22.000
confidence: 0.95
A: When you say broader community, what did that look like?

start time: 854:39:06.000
end time: 855:01:06.000
confidence: 1.00
C: So, for example, we did a mailing.

start time: 855:01:38.000
end time: 855:16:18.000
confidence: 1.00
D: To the whole district.

start time: 855:17:14.000
end time: 877:58:22.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I mean it's pretty standard. A lot of districts do it. I mean this, the city. The city does it if you've got a big bond project. So for example, in my mind. So I'm going to go back back in time in 95 we 95 last century. I know around a long time There was a 95 bond that then lasted for 17 years because we couldn't go back out because we were going for operating dollars. But like there was a mailing that was sent out. It wasn't a glossy thing. It was kind of like not newsprint, but it didn't look glossy. But it had like each school and like here's the improvements that are happening in your neighborhood school so that people could see because especially safety ones. I mean parents are pretty concerned. Like, did my school get a, you know, lead drinking water improvements or what seismic improvements have happened. But we do generally, we have generally done work on almost all schools, libraries, does this parks does that. Like, here's what's happening. Here's what happened in your neighborhood. You know, you, you write a pretty big check and then you don't ever hear like what happened. So I'm interested in that next year about how we're going to communicate effectively.

start time: 879:15:58.000
end time: 881:20:14.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Yeah, well. And communicating about it. Putting money in the pocket because it's $2.12 is a lot.

start time: 881:21:42.000
end time: 887:34:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yeah. And we are doing that in process already where we're going. We have a mailer that we're drafting is going to be, I think fairly soon. But we plan to do like a series of them. So hitting on some specific. But we can talk about what's that best target group, especially when we start thinking about voters and what the data is telling us is the most important thing.

start time: 888:10:20.000
end time: 890:16:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So I'm thinking if, you know, if anybody have any other questions around the slides. Good.

start time: 890:33:10.000
end time: 895:21:34.000
confidence: 0.93
A: All right. So one thing about the subcommittee Piece. I think we probably want to get started with the first part of September and they should probably be alternate weeks or I think we talked about doing it like the hour before. Can't remember what we talked about.

start time: 895:24:22.000
end time: 895:52:50.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I think either way works.

start time: 896:14:30.000
end time: 913:02:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So what do we do between today and probably the first? Thinking we'll probably get maybe three folks for the Bond Accountability Subcommittee. I will get you their names. I'll ask the rest of the board who wants to be on that. And then you can try to set up a time and schedule with them to figure out, you know, what days. But I think we start. My goal is to restart the first part of September like. Like that right after Labor Day. You know, we can start that early. I'll get you a list of three folks. This is two, because Julia already volunteered. And then we'll just start that process with that. And then what we'll do is maybe once every two months we will have them report back here and then kind of go from there and see how that works. Seem like a plan for you?

start time: 913:02:40.000
end time: 914:41:44.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yeah, sounds good. Just with the first meeting, a little grace if online topics if we don't have all the information yet.

start time: 914:43:12.000
end time: 914:53:12.000

B: What I'm thinking about.

start time: 915:13:04.000
end time: 918:47:40.000
confidence: 0.90
A: There's going to be a lot, you know, so. Over that part. Over that part. Can't figure that out. Anybody have any other questions, comments, any. Anybody here wants to be on the subcommittee?

start time: 919:01:30.000
end time: 920:41:54.000
confidence: 0.92
E: I don't. I don't mind being on. I think you should see if somebody else wants to. Wants to get in, but I could.

confidence: 0.84

end time: 924:20:02.000
confidence: 0.88
A: I would actually. I know you own a lot already. You know, I'm just ask this out of courtesy. You don't have to. No pressure.

start time: 924:21:06.000
end time: 924:37:38.000

D: Can I ask a question?

start time: 925:05:46.000
end time: 927:00:42.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Yeah. What's the goal of on subcommittee to get to this, the end road for.

start time: 927:01:06.000
end time: 927:49:10.000
confidence: 0.99
B: This, like the prioritization, everything.

start time: 928:06:10.000
end time: 928:20:10.000
confidence: 0.79
C: The referral.

start time: 928:21:30.000
end time: 930:45:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: The referral and all that stuff. And then they bring that back up to us and then we'll refer to the board and go from there. But the goal for the subcommittee is literally deal with all of this.

start time: 931:16:50.000
end time: 931:22:02.000
confidence: 0.99
B: How.

start time: 931:22:26.000
end time: 942:24:20.000
confidence: 0.95
E: We'Re going to push it out to the voters, what that marketing is going to look like, how we're going to get everybody on board, how are we going to rally all the people together. Because I believe at that point it becomes on us to go out and lead the drugs and say this is what we need to do. It moves from being a staff thing to being a us thing, saying, this is what we need. This is why we need it. We got to get in front of everybody. So this is when we use the political capital that we have to go out and shake hands and kiss babies and say, I'm gonna need you to put some of your money up to help us get some of this material out there, because we got to get this done and we need everybody to know. So shake hands, kiss a baby, and give me $100,000. Let's. Let's go. That's situation.

start time: 942:51:20.000
end time: 944:55:12.000
confidence: 0.93
D: And so that this committee doesn't have to take that work on that. The subcommittee will focus on it and then bring it back to this larger.

start time: 944:56:16.000
end time: 947:58:56.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yeah, so. So from my understanding, once it gets ready to go out, then the board at that point takes the reins and fundraise and push it and all that stuff.

start time: 948:00:48.000
end time: 949:01:42.000
confidence: 0.85
D: Will it come back to this one before it goes out to the board for review?

start time: 949:04:46.000
end time: 949:11:34.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah.

start time: 949:12:22.000
end time: 950:47:18.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Yeah, I think so. It goes from the subcommittee back here and then we'll refer to the board.

start time: 950:48:14.000
end time: 950:55:18.000
confidence: 0.80
B: The board.

start time: 950:56:14.000
end time: 951:36:06.000
confidence: 0.99

start time: 951:37:18.000
end time: 952:03:18.000
confidence: 0.89
A: We like it, we gotta get to work.

start time: 952:04:14.000
end time: 952:38:10.000

A: Yes.

start time: 953:48:06.000
end time: 955:31:50.000
confidence: 0.96

start time: 955:32:30.000
end time: 955:45:10.000
confidence: 0.89
A: It doesn't have to be.

start time: 955:45:50.000

B: It doesn't have to.

start time: 955:55:26.000
end time: 956:58:48.000
confidence: 0.92
F: So it's not necessarily a subcommittee of this committee, so it's sort of special.

start time: 956:59:44.000
end time: 962:44:20.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Committee of the board? Well, it'd be a subcommittee of this committee. Just will have other board. Potentially have other board members on. Yeah. All right. Any other questions? Comments? All right, meeting adjourn. All right.
