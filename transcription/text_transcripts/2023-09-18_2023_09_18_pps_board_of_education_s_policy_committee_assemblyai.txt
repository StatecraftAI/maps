start time: 27:26:40.000

A: We were going to first start with the policies that we have under revision. We had a substantive discussion at last committee's meeting about the affirmative action policy, which is being renamed the Equitable Employment policy. And Director DePass had, as we talked about in the last meeting, had a number of changes she was interested in suggesting or questions of comments she had. We also made a decision to instead of trying to just redline the document because it was actually more redlining than there was remaining content to redraft the beginning. So since last meeting the policy was redrafted and Director DePass said a number of changes. She's going to be about 15 minutes late, so I'm going to wait till she arrives for us to move ahead with that. I want her to sort of share publicly share like changes that she suggested and questions she had so that we have all that happening in a public forum and the other two items given that we might move them out of committee today. I want to wait till she gets here as well. So I am actually going to skip down to religious and cultural holidays policy because this is something I'm just elevating as and sharing that we're going to have a future discussion on. And because Director to pass last year was involved in some discussions around the school calendar. I know it won't be hard to bring her up to date, but I thought that I would at least raise the topic and we have and, and we can. This is just a flag for, for committee members and board members that we're going to be talking about it. We may move, we may create a new policy or we may also choose to make revisions of a current policy. Or we may decide not to do anything. So just as background, last year the we had a lengthy discussion about the school calendar which that you may know. Welcome, Director Scott. Welcome.

start time: 67:12:50.000
end time: 67:34:30.000
confidence: 0.97
E: That's the reason I came.

start time: 68:31:10.000
end time: 116:47:54.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So last year you might know the board is required to approve the school calendar every year. And over the years there have been discussions about how we better as a diverse school district with families that observe different religious and cultural celebrations, how do we in a district recognize that through our school calendar and try and avoid primarily after school and weekend activities which could conflict with major cultural or religious holidays. So we rebuilt the calendar and I think if you look at the calendar, the icons at the bottom, we have recognized some holidays and we do try. And there's the things that we can control like back to school nights and everything else. Trying to avo putting our families and students in the position of choosing between a school activity and a school related activity and their family celebrations or practices are important to them. So we've done that with the calendar. And the question that I wanted to ask the committee about is that we don't have necessarily a formal policy that relates to that is whether we wanted to consider a policy that we have two. There were two examples in the packet today. One is from OSBA and the other is a Beaverton one. So this being the Beaverton one, is that correct? Yes, the Beaverton one and then the OSBA one is someone longer. And there are things I think it's important that we recognize last year to recognize that there are things that we control and things we don't control. We've had, I believe we send a letter to MESD about our school and OSAA and we also send a letter to OSAA about things that the state schedules, oftentimes state competitions that occur at the same time as some important holidays. We also are just background for the two of you. Last year we went through the criteria of what should appear because we should probably have a defined criteria. Not to put you on the spot, Mary, but do you want to describe the process by which we constitutionally made decisions about what should be.

start time: 116:50:42.000
end time: 117:05:30.000
confidence: 0.90
B: I did it last time.

start time: 117:06:10.000
end time: 117:19:22.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Okay, sorry.

start time: 117:21:46.000
end time: 117:51:50.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Barry's got other stuff in this meeting.

start time: 118:08:40.000
end time: 119:39:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Because we had to set criteria about what holidays or things we would put on the calendar.

start time: 119:51:20.000
end time: 125:36:00.000
confidence: 0.89
C: So when we did the work last year, we have to have religiously neutral criteria to identify the religious or culture. The religious holidays, cultural holidays or not, don't advocate religion that are going to be observed. So we used sort of religious population threshold in Multnomah county, which was the most accurate data.

start time: 125:36:40.000
end time: 126:13:40.000
confidence: 0.92
B: It's not exactly PPS, but it's close.

start time: 126:21:20.000
end time: 132:21:44.000
confidence: 0.94
C: And I think it was a 1. As I recall the work, it was a 1% population threshold. So it's tricky. And there are parts of some of these policies that make me a little nervous how they're framed in the other examples because you do want to be again, as awkward as it sounds, religiously neutral and selecting the religious holidays that.

start time: 132:21:52.000
end time: 133:41:22.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Get observed especially I can't say that.

start time: 133:41:46.000
end time: 137:52:02.000
confidence: 0.95
C: When we were looking at it last year, I didn't see Eugene's policy. And because we had long conversations with the general counsel for Eugene at the time who said that they spent a long time reaching out to a lot.

start time: 137:52:26.000
end time: 139:36:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Of constitutional law experts as well as getting a lot of community input on.

start time: 140:18:10.000
end time: 142:42:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Because it is so difficult to try to achieve the goal without violating the law.

start time: 144:00:50.000
end time: 158:46:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So that's how we came up with the calendar last year where we have designated some days and tried to message with the principals of please don't have things that are critical for the school community or for students on days or nights. So the question for the committee is I'm interested in having a policy. Even if these were just examples again, so something's on the agenda, doesn't mean we're going to vote on it. It's more examples of policies that we could either modify. Usually this is how the OSBA sample policies, they'll send out a sample. Some districts just adopt them, others work them and others don't do them at all.

start time: 158:53:10.000
end time: 160:02:10.000
confidence: 0.86
C: Is there something about the current practice if you look different in policy language?

start time: 160:38:30.000
end time: 185:33:32.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So I think the school calendar is an imperfect mechanism to convey a set of values. It's not necessarily transparent. Like you have to look at all the little icons like I wonder how we, I wonder what we're trying to achieve here, what we're doing. And it's so all the people who are part of that discussion, we have that in great detail. But if you weren't so having some sort of high level recognition of what is our practices and our values. I mean just as an example, last week on first day of Rosh Hashanah, we sent out a major communication to families. I got some feedback that we sent out something right as families that was a variety of opinions about that. We sent it out right as families were starting to celebrate Rosh Hashanah and it wasn't very feedback I got that wasn't very sensitive and it was like, oh okay, think thinking about in a district in which we have a diversity of practices to just be aware of It. So I think the reason I would think it would be good to have a policy is it helps explain the calendar what you're trying to accomplish. So I'm just.

start time: 185:33:56.000
end time: 188:42:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I thank you and I will continue these conversations as we, as you as the committee are crafting policy language. I'm trying to discern whether we are documenting what's done or doing something different.

start time: 189:20:20.000
end time: 196:32:00.000
confidence: 0.91
A: So right now there's no policy about calendar relating to religious holidays. The existing policy and I could look it up really quick, but I believe it talks about staff getting time off or religious observance. But it's, it's definitely. It's from probably decades ago.

start time: 196:34:00.000
end time: 196:42:08.000
confidence: 0.80
B: It's.

start time: 196:43:44.000
end time: 197:16:16.000
confidence: 0.85
C: There's a, there's a line in the policy.

start time: 197:17:28.000
end time: 215:40:40.000
confidence: 0.90
A: It's that staff. Yeah. And so it's just focus on staff and hina. But a lot of. For example, two weeks ago somebody was raising the issue of their kids are going dead scheduled not to go to OT outdoor school either during and again statement something we couldn't have something we could not have done anything about anyway. Potentially. I mean. And so the way the calendar is currently constructed. Well, we call it winter break. It's obviously works around the major dominant. Dominant religion, but it's called winter holiday. So there's nobody's going to outdoor school during that holiday. I say there's some things we can do something about. We did communicate with MESD which they run outdoor school and then OSAA around co curricular activities. So not just sports but everything else.

start time: 216:50:30.000
end time: 216:57:34.000
confidence: 0.71
C: Yeah.

start time: 216:58:22.000
end time: 225:22:52.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I wonder if it's not making it worse trying to put a whole bunch of different things in. Well, having a policy gives some general framing, framing guidelines. And I say for 20 years it's a continuous issue. I think it's definitely gotten better. But it's an issue especially for families who observe holidays or cultural traditions that.

start time: 225:23:16.000
end time: 228:32:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Aren'T the dominant Ramadan too. Can we just look to cities like Minneapolis that have a very high number of people that celebrate Ramadan and New York City that have a lot of, you know.

start time: 228:43:00.000
end time: 229:22:40.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Yes. I think last year we looked at Virginia.

start time: 229:31:00.000
end time: 229:46:20.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Fairfax County.

start time: 229:47:00.000
end time: 230:04:40.000
confidence: 1.00
A: Fairfax County.

start time: 231:17:50.000
end time: 231:55:18.000
confidence: 0.88
B: So I'm going to suggest populations in Fairfax County.

start time: 231:56:14.000
end time: 244:31:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Unless. Unless there's an objection. I'm going to suggest maybe we'll come back with a couple different variations. I said primarily want to put on the agenda. Just like here are things that again, this is just this last week it got raised by several families within PPS about what do we do to acknowledge it. And it's also an issue for staff. So if you're a staff who Celebrates Christmas, you get that off. But if you're a staff member who celebrates the holiday, what are the rules and everything else. But this is an issue also where, because of the issues at play, we're going to also have to make sure that we stay within the constitutional guidelines. There is a separation.

start time: 244:50:10.000
end time: 245:33:10.000
confidence: 1.00
C: There needs to be a separation, church and state.

start time: 245:55:30.000
end time: 247:03:50.000
confidence: 0.89
A: That's why make sure that you guys keep us up.

start time: 248:18:10.000
end time: 259:01:52.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I said this last year, too. How popular it is or not. The problem, as you've articulated, is when we prefer dominant religions. Right. Which is traditional within Christianity or the Judeo Christian tradition. So I completely agree with moving away from that. One way to do that is to incorporate everything. The other way to do that is to become more secular and to really say, you know what? Our job as a district is not to acknowledge any particular religion. And I agree with you. You know, winter break is traditionally has been around Christmas. But, you know, they're. They're the other way to be fair and equitable about this, to say, you know what the school year is going to be.

start time: 259:02:16.000
end time: 259:08:32.000
confidence: 1.00
F: School year.

start time: 259:08:56.000
end time: 266:30:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: We're not going to make exceptions for Easter. We're not going to make exceptions for Christmas. We're not going to make exceptions for other things. We're going to do the school year the way we want individual students to be really clear, Always have the right, and they currently have the right. And then we can reinforce that in policy. Always have the right to opt out of particular things. But as a district, the question is how much do we want to accommodate religion as a, as a. As a secular public school district? So I think that's worthy of a conversation as well.

start time: 266:43:40.000
end time: 268:40:52.000
confidence: 0.95
B: We could also, you know, perhaps make a floating holiday or two also to accommodate staff.

start time: 268:43:56.000
end time: 268:57:56.000
confidence: 0.98
A: They have that.

start time: 268:59:08.000
end time: 271:35:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: They do have the three. Okay, do we know what the impact of that is? And like, are people taking those three days to observe?

start time: 271:50:20.000
end time: 272:10:28.000
confidence: 1.00
C: I don't think we inquire.

start time: 272:12:04.000
end time: 272:37:24.000
confidence: 0.93
B: We don't ask how they.

start time: 272:38:52.000
end time: 273:06:44.000
confidence: 0.99

start time: 273:16:20.000

start time: 273:43:40.000
end time: 273:59:00.000

A: When they choose to.

start time: 273:59:40.000
end time: 274:11:20.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Okay.

start time: 274:41:10.000
end time: 286:04:08.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So, Dr. Scott, I think those are great questions. I do think that we do. I don't think we're going to get rid of the winter holiday. So there always will be issues raised about. We've already just institutionally recognized the largest holiday in the dominant religion. And of course, then the second. But Ailey and Herman aren't here. They could tell us. But Easter's on a Sunday, so generally not an issue. Except for. For sure, when we have kids going to outdoor school on Easter Sunday we do hear from families. So I think these are good, good questions.

start time: 286:05:44.000
end time: 286:45:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Also aligns with solstice. I would just point that out.

start time: 287:10:40.000
end time: 293:43:59.000
confidence: 0.95
A: You miss the lead in. We talked about last year or year before last year. Last year we went through the whole criteria about how we constitutionally decide what can be. What we're going to recognize. And we did set. We looked at data and we drew a constitutionally allowed.

start time: 293:54:59.000
end time: 294:21:31.000
confidence: 0.99
C: That's the neutral criteria.

start time: 295:01:39.000
end time: 298:43:14.000
confidence: 0.94
A: And we can share that with you from last time. So it's not everything, but it's within a certain band that we're allowed to. Based on population. Okay.

start time: 298:44:02.000
end time: 299:16:02.000
confidence: 0.99

A: The metro area.

start time: 299:33:46.000
end time: 300:45:50.000

start time: 300:53:30.000

end time: 312:16:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: We can provide all that information. I'm trying to recall. I say this is. This is less about every once in a while. We have had questions about things happening on Easter, primarily outdoor school, because that's one of the few things that does start on a Sunday. But it's more from families who are not in the dominant religion.

start time: 313:03:10.000
end time: 313:51:18.000

start time: 313:53:34.000
end time: 317:08:10.000
confidence: 0.96

A: Let teachers know when there's big holidays and try not to schedule. But what is that based on? I mean, this is why you have a policy. Is that general guidance. And then the superintendent would implement it by.

end time: 338:14:28.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I think it is important because we are more and more multicultural society, even in Portland. And I think it is important to not take every holiday. But I think it's important for us to be aware of other people's traditions. I think it's really important.

end time: 354:55:48.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I think maybe there's room in terms of. Because I like the idea of going secular because we should. Our focus should just. Our policy should just be like, what's best for students. If it's good to have a break here and there, that's what's best for students. The problem I see is also just the convenience of the current breaks and how it aligns to everyone else in the country. Right. So like. Like sports teams go take trips because spring break to play with other schools and other states and stuff like that. And that just. That's an issue of convenience, even though it was based on, you know, like the dominant religious holidays. So, I mean, is it possible to do something two ways where we have something, where it's like, we state our goal is secular, not promoting any religion. But at the same time, we want to make sure to minimize as much disruption as possible and to, you know, try to plan things around the ones that are. That we do have.

start time: 376:48:10.000
end time: 383:35:14.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Okay, fantastic. The other thing is, I wanted to add. I'm looking for the sentence here. Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong document, but I wanted to add a sentence at the end of one of the sentences that says that we're, you know, free of discrimination as evidenced by. And I wanted to know if we could add evidence. I'm looking for the draft.

start time: 383:36:02.000
end time: 384:37:48.000

C: Right at the end of the first paragraph.

start time: 384:39:24.000
end time: 410:25:06.000
confidence: 0.93
B: It was. I just found it. It's in the redlined version, the draft dated 8, 825. And then 9. 5. The comment. And it's really small. And I can put my glasses. It's in the very first paragraph. We. We say the superintendent's budget shall incorporate funding for the diverse workforce goals provided in this policy. The board expects to see measurable progress every year in the strategies employed and progress made toward reaching the goal established by the Oregon Educators Equity Act. All district employees are responsible for providing equal employment opportunities. I'm sorry, just read all that. I think what I was asking is after Oregon's Educators act, if we could add. We could just add onto that sentence that says as evidence to buy. And I think in the. In the original version of the policy, there's some language about proportionality. In other words, our goal would be to have a staff that reflects the proportionate of our student population. Population. Our student population. Yes, it would be that. It would be aimed to be proportionate. In other words. Yeah, we want it. We want our staff to reflect ideally who we have in our schools.

end time: 412:03:50.000

end time: 417:19:00.000
confidence: 0.94
C: It says, in pursuit of this goal, PPS must develop a workforce that reflects the diversity of the students. Students it serves. Students must see their diverse racial, cultural and linguistic characteristics reflected in school staff for guiding them toward academic and other success.

start time: 417:44:00.000
end time: 421:51:24.000
confidence: 0.96
B: That gets to the proportionality piece somewhat, without using that math word. The other piece, though, is that how are we going to demonstrate these amazing values? How are we demonstrating that?

start time: 421:54:12.000
end time: 424:06:00.000
confidence: 0.93
C: I think that's the annual reporting on the data, workforce data, which would be probably, I assume, could be compared to the student population data.

end time: 425:35:40.000

A: Okay.

start time: 432:09:48.000
end time: 434:06:52.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And I put in to add that after Oregon Educators Equity act, we will add that in, if that's an appropriate place to put it.

start time: 434:08:36.000
end time: 436:40:12.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Okay. You had also asked a question about accountability.

start time: 436:42:36.000
end time: 437:10:00.000

B: How the. I mean.

start time: 437:18:40.000
end time: 437:24:56.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Yeah.

start time: 437:25:28.000
end time: 443:59:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: How do we hold staff accountable for. Maybe I should ask, do all. Do our departments reflect. Most of them reflect the cultural diversity of the city? And if not, then that would be something, you know, I would want to know.

start time: 444:16:00.000
end time: 463:13:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So here's what I think. The answer to your question, like, how do we. How do we hold And I think a more general question about how do we hold the district accountable for implementing the policy. A policy so just use that in general is that since the superintendent has the operational responsibilities for the district that somebody functional. There is a staff person functionally who would be responsible for this or anything or carrying out any other policy and ultimately the staff report to the superintendent. So if there is a sense of we're not following a the district's not following the particular policy or it's not aligned with it, that that would be an issue the board could raise with the superintendent. But ultimately it's like any other thing that would happen happens on the operational level, which is there's a functional person responsible for it. And ultimately that person is responsible is feeds up to the superintendent.

start time: 463:26:50.000
end time: 470:43:08.000
confidence: 0.91
B: That answered my question somewhat. I just was curious if we had departments that we knew could recruit be do more targeted recruiting. I don't think that's an hr. HR question. I guess as I was reading through this, these are great words and I was like, how are we going to hold ourselves accountable for implementing and hiring to reflect these values?

start time: 470:44:44.000
end time: 478:03:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Director DePass I know in the past when we've had the superintendent of the evaluation that you have added language as part of the evaluation process of the superintendent, which would be another way you could do it. Obviously. Also data is a very powerful way to have conversations about implement the effective implementation.

start time: 478:47:20.000
end time: 481:22:08.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I just, I don't have a bench line anything to like measure against right now. So I'm just sort of talking off the top of my head. But something that I have been interested in and curious about.

start time: 481:24:24.000
end time: 481:39:12.000
confidence: 0.61
C: So hr.

start time: 481:41:36.000

confidence: 0.66
A: Yes.

start time: 481:47:28.000
end time: 485:40:26.000
confidence: 0.96
C: And HR will be doing its annual employee demographic census, recruiting and retention. The data is available after October 1st. They have to pull finalize it. That will come to the board. So that gives you current look year over year.

A: Right.

start time: 487:02:10.000

start time: 490:52:10.000
end time: 494:27:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Let's talk about the reports in the last paragraph. I mean, I guess it's. I pull the mirror up to my own practice, which is like read the report and then actually say something about it, you know, or do something about it. So that's on me.

start time: 495:05:30.000
end time: 498:08:30.000
confidence: 0.89
D: I mean what then what happens after? Like who's going to do. Is it going to be the superintendent that has to do something about it? Like, I mean like the accountability. We have the data. But then.

end time: 498:33:56.000

end time: 505:41:52.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah. I mean, yeah, I agree. I think he is trying to push that, definitely. But I'm thinking about the point of policy is also long term. Right. So like the next superintendent, if may not share the same values, except that.

start time: 505:42:16.000
end time: 507:44:32.000
confidence: 0.87

start time: 508:52:56.000
end time: 510:06:08.000
confidence: 0.88

start time: 510:07:04.000
end time: 512:57:10.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Well, one of the things is there is a reporting requirement, which is not in the law, which is a tool in which the board can assess year over year product progress.

start time: 513:45:30.000
end time: 518:51:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: But yeah, it's. It is long. It's a long term and a long view. And I think that our central office, like the executive team is. Got a lot of cultural diversity. I'm just not sure like other departments. You know, I don't want to list them all off and put anybody on the spot, but.

start time: 519:50:50.000

I know I had a lot of concerns earlier on and I think a lot of it has been weed it out with some of the wording that's here. I guess my only question is, you know, instead of the equitable employment policy, is there a way. Is that the name of the policy? And if it is, can we not. Can we change that to diversity employment Policy?

end time: 546:47:42.000
confidence: 0.95

end time: 561:09:10.000
confidence: 0.96
F: No, I think it's. I think it's a lot better than when I read it the last time. I do still have little concerns when we take out, you know, when we try to be specific in what we're looking for, if we're looking for minority educators or minority staff. But outside of that, I think it's fine.

start time: 561:26:50.000
end time: 564:47:50.000

F: Yeah. I guess it's just, you know, if we're talking about a policy, I guess for me, you know we've been intentional about all the other stuff we've been doing. And so I just. This, this really kind of gives us an umbrella effect versus the intentionality effect. So that's my only, only comments. Thanks.

confidence: 0.94
A: Anything. Okay, great. I really appreciate Director Pass and Director Hollins your input from last meeting. New policy. The second, the next item on the policies for revision. Last meeting we had a discussion about the naming school district policy. We had two potential things to work on. The superintendent raised the issue of resources for any sort of naming and then also we had a discussion about what filters so that we just don't have a whole host of sort of random one off suggestions naming. And based on that, Director Wong and I had some back and forth and ran it by also staff that added two criteria. One that any petition demonstrate diverse school community support. And the second criteria was indicate the name changes being requested in accordance with and then there's a citation from policy and that specific citation was around systemic discrimination. So for example, whether it was changing, whether it was changing the McDaniel's name or let's see, Madison or Wilson or the Quakers that the two things happened. One, it was based on that particular section of the new policy at the time, the new policy in 2017 of battling systemic discrimination. And the second thing is is if that is the reason for the name change, if there are associated costs that the school community doesn't bear the name change, the cost of the name change. So like Franklin wouldn't have to go get pay for. The school community wouldn't have to pay for the new uniforms and switch them from The Quakers to Lightning or from Madison to.

start time: 634:30:50.000
end time: 639:31:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: May I interrupt about. So the only note I have for myself on this is in section seven it talks about systemic discrimination. I think it's systemic racism because discrimination is a result of. I know, I know it's a hard word.

end time: 650:06:02.000
confidence: 0.91
A: And there were other instances and I don't know if there's any other cases, but the instance of the Quakers was not an instance of racism. But having a mascot named after a religion, the techman, it wasn't the Benson.

end time: 661:16:08.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yes. Let me think about that for a while. I get it. I think, yeah, there have been two instances where gender and religion were both, you know, the, the reasons for the renaming. But I just, yeah. Had issue with, you know, systemic discrimination based on race, religion. Could it be like a sexual orientation? I don't know how to phrase it.

A: So.

start time: 684:07:24.000

confidence: 0.88

start time: 701:41:52.000
end time: 702:29:52.000

start time: 704:03:20.000
end time: 711:37:36.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So we have that and then the other recommendation. So that's another change the overall policy. But the other recommendation was that we don't cite section 21 6. Rather we just cite section 2 since that's a clause off a much longer thing. So go ahead.

start time: 711:38:48.000
end time: 711:53:52.000
confidence: 0.99

A: I'm sorry.

start time: 712:00:32.000
end time: 716:03:16.000
confidence: 0.94
E: I just had two thoughts on the policy. One of them was around the resources. I just wondered. It says right now the superintendent may indicate a need for staff resources. I wonder if be better off to say the superintendent will note the staffing or financial resources need to conduct.

start time: 716:05:08.000
end time: 718:55:32.000
confidence: 0.96
A: This is like perfect timing. We had this whole like back and forth over the weekend about like how to phrase it, because this is the.

start time: 718:55:56.000
end time: 728:28:10.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Reason why I was thinking that two things. One, I, I, I think whether or not I think it's important for us to know what the financial impact is decision whether we allocate additional resources or not is a separate board conversation. Superintendent may say, hey, in order to do this, I need a staff person. And we may say, great, we'll give you a new staff person. Or we may say, you're going to have to reallocate a staff person. So for me, what was important from a policy perspective was that the superintendent tell us why we're doing it. These are the staffing and financial resources that are going to need you to do it. And then we can have a separate conversation about whether to supplement it.

start time: 728:42:30.000
end time: 729:46:34.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yeah. Which is so you'll see in your inbox.

start time: 729:47:22.000
end time: 734:06:50.000
confidence: 0.97
D: But part of it is sort of being clear on what the scale of it is. So if the board designates or identifies X number of schools, we should just have a ballpark understanding to do a process thoughtfully. I think as you've seen stakeholders show.

start time: 734:07:30.000
end time: 734:43:22.000
confidence: 0.85
E: Up from school communities and to have.

start time: 734:43:46.000
end time: 767:54:00.000
confidence: 0.94
D: A process well coordinated and then to make sure that we implement the renaming, the mascot change, you know, there's a cost involved, a lot of it. Signage, rebranding, everything from wrestling mats to center court logos to signage, etc. You know, just looking at our budget spreadsheets, actual costs for an elementary school, it's probably about 25,000. For a high school campus, it's a quarter million dollars. So if you do one a year, you know, we can probably absorb it. But if you're doing Four a year, then that's a significant thing. You know, we should, we should create an allowance or a budget resources. So the board should just be aware that there's, there's an actual cost. Now coordinating process also takes time and effort. Typically to date these have been principal led central office community engagement support. And part of the reason for the timing is sometimes a principal will say, I can't do that right now. I'd be happy to start that in the fall with some help, maybe new principal. They might have other priorities, they may have other things on their plate. If we want to push a timeline, then we would just need to be conscious of the fact that there's going to need to be some dedicated staff help. If again, if it's, if we're only doing one, we can designate a staff member a percentage of their time and effort to go help with that. If we're doing a bunch of them, then maybe it makes sense to have a renaming coordinator who just does focus on coordinating process and community engagement to be able to do that. So if we get to a point to where it feels like it needs some supplemental resources at people or at costs, then I think it might be my responsibility to come back to the board and say this is a bit more than we can absorb within our means that we've budgeted for.

start time: 768:05:40.000
end time: 781:18:50.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So just as background board members, there are districts around the country that have done like and one fell swoop like we're going to rename 50 schools or I don't know how many of us in San Francisco, there's a lot. And the pace in Portland, I say probably there's less than five schools that I've heard and three of them are, two of them are done but left in five schools where there's been an active conversation. And so I think, Andrew, the language that you recommended, that works for me and I think it. Does it work for you, Superintendent Guerrero.

start time: 781:24:30.000
end time: 782:42:14.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Essentially to say the superintendent will note the staff and financial resources needed to.

start time: 782:42:22.000
end time: 783:28:50.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Conduct the process, not me.

start time: 783:51:10.000
end time: 786:48:22.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Well, so what would be helpful is to scope out for a coming school year. Expect to do elementary and high school six schools or we do 20 schools, whatever the number is.

start time: 786:48:46.000
end time: 787:17:30.000
confidence: 0.86
E: And I need to adjust.

start time: 787:47:50.000
end time: 790:15:58.000
confidence: 0.92
A: I mean the one thing is the way it also one of the options is the board can defer action on their request to a later date, which could be another like sequencing.

start time: 790:17:34.000
end time: 790:31:30.000
confidence: 0.55
D: Exactly.

start time: 790:46:30.000
end time: 790:58:22.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Piece.

start time: 791:00:46.000
end time: 791:43:30.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Maybe we're always doing one, but there's a queue.

start time: 792:27:50.000
end time: 797:28:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And then the second comment I had was just the sense of petition needs to demonstrate diverse school community support I just don't know what we meant by diverse. It says the petition needs to demonstrate diverse school community support. And I just wasn't sure if we needed to define what that meant. I wasn't sure if that was a synonym for broad. I wasn't sure if it was getting.

start time: 797:29:30.000
end time: 803:39:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: At something else, things that we're talking about. It's also just reason. At least me wanted to keep it kind of broad is because it allows some flexibility in adjusting in the future in case unintended or unforeseen issues arise. But it still, like, holds a kind of like bar so that not everyone could just like.

start time: 804:00:30.000
end time: 814:48:08.000
confidence: 0.96
E: And I guess what struck as I listened to the last meeting and sort of some of the concerns raised by Gary and others around, you know, this, this does allow an individual to bring something forward. And I know that's why we've added the language. And it just made me think, well, who's evaluating? So if I'm an individual and I come forward and I say I want to change the school name and I've talked to five of my friends and they want to do it too, you know, does that qualify as diverse support? Does it need to be 50? Does it need to be 100? And is the board determining whether it's diverse support or is it the superintendent? Because if I come forward with five and the board says we're just not going to take that up right now, and then I come back again the next week with 10, like, do we need to define it in terms of what that means?

start time: 814:50:24.000
end time: 818:44:20.000
confidence: 0.92
B: IWS had a nice diverse. I think they included some alum, you know, from way back, and students, I mean, I guess. But I think it's. At your point, you want it to be. Do we spell it out?

start time: 820:02:40.000
end time: 833:53:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I think it's better to leave it high level versus defined because it's like, hey, you can get a. I mean, I think you can get a petition with 500 people on it for about anything. So it's like putting a number on it versus And I think ultimately we're elected district wide is that we can make those decisions of what we consider to be diverse or comprehensive. And I mean, sometimes we have names of schools that aren't necessarily that are named after an individual, that maybe that individual school community is fine with, but it violates.

start time: 834:08:00.000
end time: 834:56:08.000
confidence: 0.91
B: For instance, Jefferson, there's a.

start time: 834:57:04.000
end time: 857:06:10.000
confidence: 0.93
A: There's a group that's fine with that and a group that's not as I've over the years. But I was also thinking of, for example, Scott. I mean, there are a variety of opinions and sometimes it's like, either people don't know the person's history or, you know, we don't care. I think what we tried to do is, and this is the balance that we are trying to strike here is that you shouldn't have the tyranny of the majority also making decisions. For example, there were a lot of discussions, Franklin, of like, we want to stay with Quakers, and it's like named after the oatmeal or the oil. I mean, literally, this is what we heard. And okay, but for. If you were a Quaker family at Franklin and you had people stepping on your religion or playing basketball in your religion, or the variety of things that were like, we are going to lead through a process to move people along, even though it wasn't like, here's 500 or, you know, the majority of the student body or the majority of the lums. I would say the majority of the lums were like, we want to keep it how it is.

start time: 857:13:50.000
end time: 866:08:16.000
confidence: 0.95
E: So I'm thinking about this from a very practical perspective and maybe tell me if I'm understanding the policy right. I got a sense that anyone can bring this forward, but you have to demonstrate diverse school community support in order to move on to number five, where the board will either direct the superintendent, do it, decline the request, and so not that we would do one of those three things on anything that came forward. Am I reading that policy right? So, for instance, as an individual, if I say I want to change the school name, does that require the board to pass a resolution saying, we're not going to?

start time: 866:09:28.000
end time: 874:52:38.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I think if it doesn't make that. Or for example, the reason why Franklin moved ahead is because we actually changed the policy to the. That clause that we just changed, which is it violates the policy on at the time, systemic discrimination. And so that was the only. That's the only standard we've had to date. Right.

start time: 874:53:34.000
end time: 879:11:20.000
confidence: 0.97
E: So with the word diverse school community support, is that staff saying that the board now it meets that criteria for the board to take action on it, or is that the board deciding whether it does? Again, I'm sorry, I just. I'm thinking about it very practically, like.

start time: 879:12:00.000
end time: 879:28:24.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Like, how.

start time: 879:31:12.000
end time: 880:27:36.000
confidence: 1.00
E: How will we define that to know if we move on to section five.

start time: 880:30:08.000
end time: 881:07:04.000
confidence: 0.88
B: And take it from it looks like.

start time: 881:07:12.000
end time: 882:18:00.000
confidence: 0.98
C: The board will do it as drafted. This looks like a board determination whether.

start time: 882:18:40.000
end time: 882:31:04.000
confidence: 0.99
B: That'S intended or not.

start time: 882:31:12.000
end time: 887:37:38.000
confidence: 0.95
C: But that's how I read the language in terms of what the board determining that the petition needs to demonstrate diverse school community support. The requests are presented to the school board. The Request has to demonstrate these things and then the school board will take one of these actions. So it doesn't have to be how you want.

start time: 887:38:34.000
end time: 891:36:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: So in practice, it's probably going to be leadership. Who then sort of board leadership who looks at a particular petition and either says yes, we think this meets sort of the diverse school community support. So we're going to move it on to whether the board can take take action or. You know what? This just really doesn't.

start time: 891:55:50.000
end time: 894:07:58.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I think you're right. And like with everything else, if the. The majority of the board are like, we don't agree with leadership. Yeah. So, yeah, I think you're right, Andrew.

start time: 894:09:34.000
end time: 894:18:06.000
confidence: 0.99

end time: 897:21:02.000
confidence: 0.82
A: Thank you. Sorry. I'm sorry. So for what it's worth, in the committee, unless people are close to it, because this is more formal setting, can we use first names or do you. Would you. Everybody around it.

end time: 907:46:10.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Oh, I was just going to say the other thing that we were kind of conscientious about is that we didn't want the bar set so high that it was difficult for people in places with less resources or local time to be able to change. So I think that's. That's kind of why I think you left a little bit open. But, yeah, that's a real issue. Who's going to review this?

start time: 907:51:10.000
end time: 909:14:50.000

B: Yeah, that's what I thought.

start time: 926:21:56.000
end time: 926:30:52.000
confidence: 0.82
A: And we'll.

start time: 926:31:56.000
end time: 926:51:08.000
confidence: 0.98
C: We can add it there, too.

start time: 926:52:04.000

B: Okay, thank you.

start time: 927:16:20.000
end time: 927:42:22.000

A: So I'm asking.

start time: 927:43:56.000
end time: 942:05:50.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I have a question. So I'm just throwing this out here. So, you know, with this policy and all the things we're trying to avoid or not avoid, could it be possible we just go to numbers? I mean, unless someone is going to discriminate against, you know, a number, like, you know, PPS school 1, 2, 3, PBS school 1, 2, 4. It just seemed like we're talking about something that I think is. I mean, I think it's okay, but it is. It just doesn't really seem like it's going to get us to our board goals. And if we're having this conversation now, I can imagine what other boards might have conversations about this, you know, in the future. So would it be simpler just to go to a number system versus the naming system? Just a thought.

start time: 942:21:40.000
end time: 952:07:20.000
confidence: 0.98
A: You mean we'd be naming our schools like New York City, like PS1, like New York Chicago? I mean, it's interesting because, you know, Beaverton has a very different policy of naming it, like, not after people generally. And we. We have a mix of. They're mostly people because even if they seem like they're named after neighborhoods, they're actually. Those neighborhoods usually got named after people. I think that's a way bigger topic.

start time: 952:17:00.000
end time: 959:18:06.000
confidence: 0.95
B: You know, it's a really interesting question, though, Gary, because of our spatial. Our land use and who lives where in Portland and who is allowed to live where. Who couldn't buy land here in 1940s and 50s? And. And so I think it's really interesting. I say that because there's a lot of community pride around, like, where you live, and I just think it's fascinating. Yeah.

start time: 959:18:38.000
end time: 959:40:50.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Why not use numbers?

start time: 960:38:30.000
end time: 962:37:30.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Why not just name it like Paris? Like, just go in a shell shape until we get to 81?

start time: 962:58:30.000
end time: 971:38:12.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Director Hollinger think that's a very provocative idea. I think if that's something that, if leadership wanted to ask the board whether we'd want to take that on, that'd be a huge community discussion, which doesn't mean you wouldn't do it. But I'm gonna let you and the vice chair decide whether that's something you want to ask the board to do. Because that is. I could just imagine what the superintendent's gonna say that requires in terms of.

start time: 971:38:36.000
end time: 972:20:40.000

D: Status, I serve at the pleasure.

start time: 973:00:50.000
end time: 975:15:10.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Or we can take the stance that, you know, the community have voted us in to make decisions and use that mantra.

start time: 976:11:30.000
end time: 978:01:50.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Okay, if you would. If you would like the committee to look at that, I can add it to a future agenda.

start time: 978:51:30.000
end time: 987:26:18.000
confidence: 0.95
F: It was just a thought. So if the committee that's there, you know, wants to go down that road or something that, you know, I just threw it out there. Something just to kind of get us away from, you know, having to look at people's names and things and things that they've done now and how it's interpreted, you know, five or 10 years from now or 20 years from now, you know, it's just, it just seemed like it gets us to really just focus on the educational thing, you know, the purpose of what we're here for.

start time: 987:27:14.000
end time: 996:41:50.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So I'm going to ask the committee members and I'm not going to put you on the stock right now, but between now and the next committee meeting, will you tell me if that's some topic that you want to undertake? Sure. Again, not to put you on the spot and you don't need to answer now because we obviously aren't going to have. She's not going to sleep at the time, but appreciate you raising that. We always need disruptors of thinking.

start time: 996:44:30.000
end time: 998:18:10.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Gary, Superintendent 14 or whatever number I am has two meetings.

start time: 999:54:30.000
end time: 1000:07:58.000
confidence: 0.86
A: I'm going to ask.

start time: 1000:08:54.000
end time: 1000:24:46.000
confidence: 0.88
C: I just had.

start time: 1000:27:18.000
end time: 1002:30:22.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So actually here it shows three choices. One is to defer action and they're post to a later date.

start time: 1002:32:46.000
end time: 1002:52:46.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Do we need that?

start time: 1002:55:18.000
end time: 1019:13:26.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Well, I think so because it could be. We currently have staff, you know, we're at staff capacity or. Oh, okay. But if we want it. But we can't. Right. Or say leadership. We think this demonstrates broad support or something. And the rest of the committee is like, hey, we here's like we need more historical data on this person or we need to hear from this, this group before we move into a renaming process. So I'm going to ask the two committee members, do you want to move this policy out to the the full board for first reading with the changes that were discussed?

start time: 1019:16:38.000
end time: 1019:37:30.000
confidence: 0.90
D: Yes, yes.

start time: 1021:43:10.000
end time: 1033:58:06.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Cognizant of the time. So I want to just ask one question I think which will be relatively brief so we can. Shereen, have covered it. Has there been any public comment on the policies listed in number five, student educational records, instructional materials, class size or nutrition services, meal pricing and purchasing? No. Okay, just Eddie, for you. Generally what we do is anything that's out for a first reading. When we have a committee meeting, if there's any public comment, we talk about it and whether we want to make any changes to what's in it. So we. It's always on the agenda until it goes to the other side.

start time: 1034:00:38.000
end time: 1034:09:50.000
confidence: 0.62
B: Okay.

start time: 1034:11:10.000
end time: 1037:04:50.000
confidence: 0.75
A: For approval. Okay.

start time: 1037:23:50.000
end time: 1038:03:26.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Those are all the stuff listed under the attachments.

start time: 1038:05:18.000
end time: 1038:12:14.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Pardon?

start time: 1038:13:02.000
end time: 1038:52:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Those are all the stuff listed under the attachments.

start time: 1038:53:50.000
end time: 1049:46:24.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Right. It's the fourth ones. Yeah. So we, we already moved them out of committee and they're out for first reading for front 21 days. And so if anybody commented normally the practice instead of having the full board discuss a comment. So sometimes people have suggestions that we want to incorporate and if so in committee if somebody has A suggestion we incorporate it. If it's a significant change, we might have another first reading because this significant change or we may deem it not significant and we. Or like a friendly amendment and we go ahead and approve it at the next meeting. Assume 21 days.

start time: 1049:47:52.000
end time: 1049:58:20.000
confidence: 0.75
B: Done.

start time: 1050:59:20.000
end time: 1065:37:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Okay, so that's done. And we have five public comments. Right. Okay. So the next agenda item we have is community engagement. Is the equitable private. I'm sorry, school initiation enclosures. And I'm afraid if we bring that up, we're not going to actually have time for any conversation on the raising. Yeah, I think there's that public comment. Yeah. So if it's okay with members of the committee, we'll hold that over. We talked about it last time and there weren't a lot of changes. So we can hold it over to the next meeting before moving it just so we can just.

start time: 1065:39:00.000
end time: 1066:38:20.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Julia, just on that, I have some concerns with that policy. I'll send them to you.

start time: 1066:39:00.000
end time: 1155:31:02.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Oh, yeah, that'd be great. One other reason to. Okay, so equitable private funding from school staff. I hope that everybody had a chance to. Well, I'm sorry, Eddie and Andrew and anybody who is attending the meeting virtually. I made a statement in my committee report about the status and the video cut out. So I had a bunch of people afterwards like what, what was it you said? So I tried to create verbatim of what I are close to verbatim what I said at the, at the board meeting and included in the committee comments. And then so again, sorry, Andrew and Eddie were there virtually. So you missed what I said. And then I'm going to ask the next, at our board meeting tomorrow night, just I'll do a repeat. So it's for people who missed it have an opportunity to just find out. It's mainly a report on how we're going to set up our committee's work and also to share when things appear on the agenda. So if we're going to vote on something, it'll be marked as an action item. So people can. If it's an action item, people have an opportunity to come and give public comment in addition to the general comment. If we're just discussing it, they'll usually say discussion if it doesn't say anything. But if it doesn't say action, we're definitely not taking action. And as a general practice, I'll be just feeding things into the committee just so we have an opportunity to sort of like, here's what's coming on the horizon in general. And so this is an item that has been before the district and worked for probably 15 years or so and it has been actively worked by the policy committee since 2017. Andrew last year as chair laid out a timeline for two things happened. Laid out a timeline for the discussion. We had a full board. We had a full board discussion about it twice I think. And then we also had a work session that I guess or a community meeting I guess it was like a community meeting, community meeting on it. And also last year based on their recommendation or suggestion from Director Hollins, we. We put about $8 million into resources that were available to the school community that were about 100 to 120,000. And I don't know if we described it as a pilot but it was one year of funding because it was Esser or one of the COVID one time monies to see if that would be a way in which we could provide some additional equity for those. For those schools that don't either get equity dollars or title dollars or CSI or TSI dollars or even if they do, oftentimes it's very directive of how they have to spend the money. And then there's schools that have some, some resources, some that have more than that and then some that don't happy me at all. And so I think last year the. It was the one year in which I heard the least amount of from school communities about we had a very specific school need that we weren't able to fill. So that's. So last year even though we had three conversations there was going to be a policy draft moved. I think it was targeted for February. That didn't happen. And so everything else just carrying it forward into this to this year. What I would like to do today is if I think in the past because Michelle you've. You've been through several iterations, asked for some community engagement. I am interested. So we set up the conversation in a database with all of us understanding the data or having the same data in front of us specifically the new committee members and new board members. Like what data would you like to have as part of our committee discussions? There's a number of different things like Dr. Adams has come in before and brought in. Here's the data on how district money gets distributed and over a number of years.

start time: 1155:32:46.000
end time: 1155:46:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And then.

start time: 1156:39:20.000
end time: 1164:41:34.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Jonathan has brought in data on here's what the two pieces, here's what school foundations have purchased staff wise and here's what the school is receiving the equity grants, what they purchased. So those are all data points. I mean so those are things that I would Want to to me that that's what I'll be asking for.

start time: 1164:44:22.000
end time: 1170:20:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: We also had a chart, I believe furnished by the reform folks. I'm sorry, everybody showed actual allocations comparing the equity funding, building by building. And I think that would be helpful.

start time: 1170:43:50.000
end time: 1192:51:26.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I think I have most of the hat. So what I would like as a sort of level setting and like a new year new board is to have. I'd like you to send in what it is you feel like you need. The other thing that I would be interested in again, last year was one of the first years in which I felt I heard significantly less. So like a school community needs like we needed another point two to do X or we really wanted to have time. Like we had one and a half school counselors and we wanted to. So we, you know, we had the resources. So last year was the first year that I heard less. So one of the things I want to know is like last year with that money that we gave them, not that we have it necessarily again, but what, what did school communities buy that they felt like they didn't get in the allocation they got from the district? So for example, that's one thing I would want because that's a new piece of data for me. So you would want to ask the school. Well, we have it somewhere like because they had to submit. Looking back at the two individuals in the back. The school based funding.

start time: 1192:51:58.000
end time: 1193:03:58.000
confidence: 0.88
B: Is that what you're saying?

start time: 1193:04:54.000
end time: 1194:35:00.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yeah, because it all went through a process for for example, they presented a plan and then.

start time: 1194:58:40.000
end time: 1196:03:00.000
confidence: 0.86
B: Yep, we haven't heard. So I'm sorry, what was. Is there a question?

start time: 1196:12:00.000
end time: 1206:13:46.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So there's a question about what, what was it and. Or who has the data so we wouldn't have to get it from schools. They all the schools at the end of and during the budget cycle they spent that 125,000. So in the superintendent's budget. And again this is an idea of director Hollings. 8 million of one time money was distributed out and there was, I think it depended on elementary, middle or I mean what type of school you were. And then I want to say there were some rough per capita ranges. I'm seeing an odd factor.

start time: 1206:14:18.000
end time: 1206:27:06.000
confidence: 0.87
B: There's a lump sum.

start time: 1206:27:38.000
end time: 1222:35:20.000
confidence: 0.93
A: And then on top of it there was some based on student population. And based on that I got a certain amount. And then there was some also qualifier that if you, you had raised some money to buy staff that you had to spend part of it on something else. But they all submitted plans that they were supposed to be compliant with Sometimes. Yes. And Based on that, I don't think anybody was denied, were they? So for me, I want to see like, what was that? That again, I heard less from the schools that don't. Some of the schools that got equity funds, it's like, well, we don't. We can't buy anything with $20,000 or $30,000, whatever that, whatever the amount is, because it depends, it varies, is they were actually able to buy things that were substantive and meaningful to their school.

start time: 1222:51:10.000
end time: 1223:20:38.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Some were able to cover that money.

start time: 1223:21:34.000
end time: 1245:54:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Up with some other monies to get like a vice principal or a climate specialist or any other resource that involves. So the question I would have for committee members and anybody participate in a second, I'd like to have a consistent. I'd like to have one sort of, this is the information we're interested in and have it be presented. So we all start with the same information. We can ask questions as sort of like the foundational piece. So the assignment between now and the next meeting would be to send those. And when I have everybody's, I will share it with the broader group. Not for reply all. So we don't have a meeting, but so people know what question. And we use that as the starting. Starting point. Is that. Okay. So you're asking that we all get that information. You're just starting. Yeah. This is a extra credit assignment since you're not on the committee. But you're. But I'm. So you're. But I just make sure. Oh, that's right.

start time: 1245:55:10.000
end time: 1246:56:38.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Yeah. But you're still on the board.

start time: 1246:58:54.000
end time: 1247:03:18.000
confidence: 0.40
C: Yeah.

start time: 1247:03:34.000
end time: 1251:00:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: No, I'm not meaning to be exclusive. I'm just like saying that I also want to respect the committee process. Now, if Director Hollins wants to assign you to the committee, I can. But it means you have to come.

start time: 1251:42:50.000
end time: 1254:50:42.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Yeah, I think having the data, the common data makes a lot of sense. The other thing I would just add, we don't have to talk about it today because I know we're out of time, but it's just from a process issue. Like, I think there's some real. I have some real process concerns about.

start time: 1254:51:06.000
end time: 1255:09:22.000
confidence: 0.98
D: How we're going to move forward with this.

start time: 1255:09:46.000
end time: 1260:50:20.000
confidence: 0.96
E: And there were concerns I had last year as well as doing everything we could to bring the community together around the proposal rather than divided. And so I'd be interested in the board having a conversation this year about what's the best way to move forward, which something I think is important that we making some progress and make some changes to the foundation policy, but do it in a way that is collaborative and Divisive.

start time: 1260:51:40.000
end time: 1263:38:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So my goal, My goal would be to have something that is equitable and that has support.

start time: 1263:53:40.000
end time: 1275:21:54.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Excellent. I just also want to say that we have gotten mail from people that feel like they haven't been heard. And when we were at Harvard, one of the things that we were advised, admonished, you know, suggested we do is to intentionally seek out people that we disagree with. And I know I personally have not. You know, I'm all about community engagement, regardless of whether I agree or disagree. I think it's important for us to listen to all of the voices in the room. And I feel like we haven't heard from. I mean, I. We've heard in our inboxes from people that are, you know, describing the process as not fair to them. And, you know, I, I just feel like we should make an effort to.

start time: 1275:23:22.000
end time: 1275:51:50.000
confidence: 0.99
A: I would, I would just note.

start time: 1276:04:10.000
end time: 1276:32:18.000
confidence: 0.98
B: And also I see that you.

start time: 1276:33:14.000
end time: 1278:18:58.000
confidence: 0.96
A: In our second meeting, and I think there. I don't want to go into.

start time: 1278:19:54.000
end time: 1289:28:28.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Okay, I just gotta say there are key stakeholders in our district that are missing from this conversation. I'll just put it at that. Some of the people have, that have process concerns or outcomes concerns, regardless of my own feeling about it, because I would love to see our district, you know, move to a system that benefits kids that look like me. And I still feel like we need to, we need to do a better job of, I mean, inviting people to the room, to the table to talk about. That's including those schools that, that don't even. Like the schools in my zone that are.

start time: 1289:30:44.000
end time: 1289:53:32.000
confidence: 0.79
E: Don't even know the conversation's going on.

start time: 1289:53:56.000
end time: 1295:35:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: They don't know the conversation's happening. And yeah, we went out to two, had two meetings and talked to five people or whatever, but we need to be very intentional about doing an educational piece and doing a take over our mouth and listen, because we're going to end up with a better policy for having listened to people that we don't agree with. I strongly believe that.

start time: 1295:36:20.000
end time: 1298:44:36.000
confidence: 0.95
A: As someone who's listened to both sides of this for six years, I feel like I always listen to like, same thing with the climate policies. Yes, we can get through to the other side.

start time: 1298:45:48.000
end time: 1299:33:56.000
confidence: 0.94
B: That's you. You've been here a long time. Well, I haven't.

start time: 1299:35:48.000
end time: 1301:22:40.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Can I finish my statement? And we're going to do our work in public.

start time: 1301:33:00.000
end time: 1302:27:48.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So that's another thing I would ask, is that we do it in public.

start time: 1302:30:04.000
end time: 1320:03:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Well, that's, that's why we're here at the committee. That's why I'm asking them. We all have the same data. Not that we are getting private meetings from different people getting different data that we have the. In a public meeting we'll have public comment. And I want to do want to address the comments that have been made about the community engagement because I thought they were very dismissive and actually that was run by our community engagement team. Director Hollins and Director Green both recommended individuals. There were people that don't usually show up at our board meetings and representing their community. And I have been really disappointed that some people have like purposely dismissed them with when it was. This was a request from the committee two years ago for the community engagement team to run it. So it's like we shouldn't now be dismissing. I mean it's part of.

start time: 1320:22:10.000
end time: 1331:23:26.000
confidence: 0.96
B: And perhaps, I mean I'm even willing if we need to actually go to people rather than expecting them to come here. So I'm not trying to be dismissive. I'm just saying when I look around in the room, I'm just using my eyes and my senses here to notice that the people that have the most to gain probably aren't necessarily in the conversation and the people that are maybe the most actively, you know, not disengaged but that we're hearing from in our inboxes also. I'm not hearing from. And you probably have, you've been around a long time but I haven't.

start time: 1331:25:18.000
end time: 1340:04:04.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Engagement that's been posted actually was held at McDaniels and the other was held at Roosevelt. I understand it was at the invitation of the community engagement team based on recommendations from principals of like George Roosevelt and other school communities. And we can do more of that. But I do want to say that we have. There was that and it was totally led by the community engagement team and then they summarized it and we contacted.

A: I'm just worried about some of the emails we've got who said like hey, we're hard working volunteers and those other non representative people, which was not the case. And like I don't want to accept that because it's dismissing people whose voices we asked to be part of the table with that. And I wanted comments so that we ended. So I would ask anybody who wants to, who's on the list to provide public comment to come to the table. It's just easier for us to hear. And you'll have two minutes and Carol will call your name and then you have two minutes and she'll tell you when your time is up. And also people obviously can. You could also submit testimony for the record if people want to, and we'll post it up as well. We have Susan Carson.

C: My name is Susan Carson. C A R S O N I'm a member of the Reform PPS funding group, but today I'm speaking primarily as the parent of a McDaniel High School student who experiences significant disabilities and who has an iep. I'm concerned that recently, advocacy to keep the local school foundation status quo has included the narrative that foundation funds are being used to support students with disabilities. And by taking away these private funds, students will lose services and have to leave the district. I find this narrative disturbing for several reasons. The right of students with disabilities to access a free and appropriate public education is codified in federal law. It's not a special favor granted only when funds are available or when generous private donors underwrite extra staff. During my family's 10 year experience in Portland Public schools, I've witnessed many families pull their students with disabilities out of PBS because their needs weren't being met and they felt they had no other choice. These decisions are never made lightly and are almost always preceded by years of trauma. So when I hear if we don't let parents raise funds for their children's schools, they're going to leave the district and that raises such alarm bells it really stinks. Where is the concern when students with disabilities leave the district? Do they matter less than the star athletes and valedictorians? Applying a band aid in individual schools or classrooms in response to the most pressure, privileged or loudest voices does nothing to address the systemic issues facing the district's special education department. It has always been my hope that PPS would truly see all students as our students, regardless of whether they're placed in general education, receive learning center support, or spend time in a focused classroom or intensive skills class. I'm almost done.

C: Moving to a district wide foundation and advocating together for funding and support at the state level could be a powerful step toward that goal. We in the special education community are used to being fierce at allies. I urge you to move forward with the draft proposal submitted by the Reform group so that we can get started.

G: Yes, thank you. It's Ashley Schofield. Yes, Good afternoon. I'm a mom to a second grader at Brighton Mile elementary in Southwest Portland. I come here as an apparent and advocate that is begging you to stop delaying reform with our current local school foundation system. Over the last few years as a parent, I've questioned and raised concerns about how much fundraising and organized in my son's school. I've tried my best to understand why parents and families have to raise so much money to buy staff members that seem very much needed. Like a reading interventionalist. That is what Brighton Mile has used their foundation money for this year. I've attended school board meetings to understand the policy conversation. I met one on one with our school principal multiple times to understand the value add of foundation money. I've raised the conversation with my peers community and I've listened to what other communities are saying. I seem to ask uncomfortable questions like how is an auction that makes you pay at least 300 to $400 to participate and gives you special access to teachers administrators okay. Within a public school system that boasts it cares about equity? I thought it'd be a simple question. But what I've encountered are families who are scared and conditioned to believe that they won't be able to give their child the best education unless they tirelessly fundraise. The truth is our communities don't want to fundraise and it seems like the schools district is relying on us to do so. They don't actually have to support our schools. In a city that was built on the foundation of racism and white supremacy using the tools of racist housing policies, it is more than ever important we dismantle traditional systems that do not serve our quest for an inclusive world. We know this policy we have now is broken and that it creates inequitable outcomes on the basis of race. I've heard most of you say this in one way or another in past meetings. So what are we doing about it? Because we are ready to work together. We are ready to get rid of those invisible lines between communities and work on a path we all agree on, which is that our children deserve the best education. While the community still needs to work together towards state driven solutions for school funding, the school board has an important and critical role in leading the direction for change at our local level. A district wide foundation that also prioritizes advocacy in tandem with fundraising is a path that allows you to act now. Thank you for your time.

H: Of the Policy Committee. Thanks for your time. I'm Peter Sachs. S, A C H S. My pronouns are he, him, his. I'm a parent of a first grader at Alameda. My introduction to this topic came in April at the workshop or the community meeting that was brought up and what struck me about that was I thought it was a really well intentioned exercise to gather some opinions and one of the opinions I heard from some, certainly not all members of the reform side, but several people vocally stated that their desired outcome didn't seem to be about what's best for students or lifting up all students in our district. Their desired outcome was simply to end foundations. We've on the foundation side have asked that this topic be taken to the Innovation Studio to develop a well rounded analysis and set of solutions. And certainly that could help with some of the data questions and analysis that you brought up, Director Grim Edwards. But this committee continues to ignore that request and it's a reasonable one and has a proven track record of working well for pps. Such a move, even with a six month timeline attached, will give the Board and the Policy Committee the time to focus on more pressing matters such as a looming teacher strike. I don't doubt for a second to willingness of PAT to go on strike and neither should any of us. This is not a time to play brinksmanship, but we're spending time on the foundation discussion. Enrollment imbalances. We have a number of schools that are profoundly under enrolled and others are extremely crowded. And this is independent of the foundation question. Both of those extremes cause detrimental learning outcomes. Failing to tackle that really difficult and important set of issues while wasting time on the foundation discussion instead undermines whatever results the committee hopes to see from the RESJ lens. And finally, systematic defunding of educational support roles. And here I'm not talking about special ed. I'm talking about education assistance, our librarians and support staff that play really important functions in our schools. Alameda's foundation is not buying teachers or adding sections or cutting class sizes. This past year we raised enough for 1 1/2 ftes. That was 2 part time eas and part of our media specialist salary. The fact that we're systematically cutting these support roles at select schools, that by itself is profoundly inequitable when we should be starting at a baseline where those positions exist and adding to them at schools where the need is demonstrated through the equity lens. Thank you for your time.

I: My name is Grace Groom. I'm a PPS teacher and parent. I'm also a current member of the Community Budget Review Committee. I'm here today to ask this committee to move forward on the reform PPS funding group, draft policy to the full board for a vote. As previously mentioned, this has been talked about as in the committee for quite some time and for the CBRC, it's been a topic of every report since 2018. This year it seems the board is very interested, maybe more so than past years with the CBRC report. And we appreciate the support and feedback and effective participation in the budget process. In our recent report, the CBRC stated that it is important to note that individual school foundation funds should be acknowledged as inequities because these funds are included in the budget document making this open for CBRC review. We want to highlight the inequities here. The foundation is highlighted in the budget on page 134. CBRC has made note that some schools have more access to foundation funds than others and this increased funding is largely available to schools serving populations of higher sesame and lower percentages of black, brown and indigenous students. We encourage the district to develop strategies to decrease the inequities, including but not limited to policy revisions that could provide for a collective foundation district wide to distribute collected donations in a more equitable way. I also just want to mention this discussion about do we move fast or slow? To quote a former community advocate and former board member Rita Moore, at a different topic on boundary reviews, we are at no risk of being too slow on this. This has been a long time coming and we really just need to put some action to it. To hear the discussion tonight. I appreciate wanting to bring more voices to the table and those voices are speaking in terms of their need. We see it in the numbers. We see it in every day in the classroom. And we just need to come together as a community and walk our talk. One pot of money equitably distributed and no more deflecting. No more saying we're wasting time talking about this instead of that. This is all part of the equity discussion and it needs to move forward. Thank you.
