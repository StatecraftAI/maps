A: Alright, let's get started. This work session of the Board of education for 03-18-2025 is called to order. All items being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the board and meetings tab. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. All right. Good evening. Welcome. Thank you all for being here. I know Director Sullivan and Director Green will be joining us virtually tonight.

A: Great. Before we get started, last week we passed a resolution celebrating classified and non representative staff week. And we recognized people who were here who have been working for us for you know, five, 10, 20, 30, 50 years. And I just want to also pass out Janice Hanson who's our board appointed auditor, wasn't here this last week, so we delayed this. First, I want to start with apology. Due to budget cuts, we couldn't get the gold medallions this big. And so we settled with lanyards which are just as nice because they're actually more useful than gold. And this is for five years. So thank you Janice Hance for being with us for five years. Plus thank you for staying. And if you want to go home, feel free. If you work for us for five years, you can go home early or more. Yeah. All right, next up we have the consent agenda. Right now we're going to vote on the consent agenda and if there's board members, if there's any items you would like to pull for a separate discussion, please let us know now.

C: It came so quickly, so I wanted to just briefly mention something about the field trips were going to be approving tonight. I'm supportive of them and I'm also looking forward to later this spring having a discussion about middle school redesign and also the capstone projects. So There was a district complaint about the field trips and what was happening at the schools while students were gone on extended trips. And there was an agreement with school communities and the superintendent at the time to do two things. One, to ensure that the students who were still at the schools for an extended period of time, that they would have their learning be uninterrupted. It would just continue on. And the second piece was that from an equity standpoint, that all of our 8th graders deserved a opportunity for a capstone trip or travel, may not be two weeks, but that we know our students benefit from that. And because of COVID that got interrupted. And I'm going to be interested in finding out where we are. I know we've made some progress, but I think from the standpoint from this board, when we look at what are equitable opportunities for our students, that we keep to our promises that were made, which is we're going to try and ensure that all 8th graders get a get some sort of capstone trip or travel. Thanks.

D: School Board. My name is Christina Howard and I am the Chief Academic Officer. I'm pleased to be here this evening to discuss the four year graduation rates and five year completion rates for the class of 2024. I believe we're loading the slides now. I am joined by Dr. John Franco, Chief of Schools, Ms. Margaret Calvert, Assistant Superintendent and Dr. Philippe Hriestich, the Senior Director for 912 Academics. We look forward to hearing your questions and ask that you please hold them until the end of the presentation. Our 912 academics team will also be here in a couple of weeks to provide a more in depth presentation on 9th grade, on track, advanced coursework and CTE. At this point, I will pass it to Dr. Franco, our chief of Schools and I think he's still loading the presentation.

B: So Christina was so fast. Okay, directors, good evening. So in my experience as a former high school principal and now currently as the chief of schools, every graduating class has a specific character and unique set of circumstances that define their high school experience. And so just would like to acknowledge and call out this current or last year's class of 24. They are the class that ended 8th grade with the start of the pandemic. They experienced their entire ninth grade online and then finished their senior year with a work stoppage and winter ice storm. Nonetheless, they persevered and experienced admirable success. So as you can see here on this chart, the class of 2024, the four year graduation cohort percentage is 84%. It's also important to look at the five year completer numbers which was 86.9%. The red is the four year and the blue is the five year. We're still in the mid-80s within graduation and of course our goal overarchingly is 100% of our kids here in PPS graduate. 90% graduation rate as a district is definitely within reach. We are above pre pandemic graduation rates. Each graduation, each graduating class, if you think back to it between 2020 and 2024 saw different graduation requirements. Because of the context given this looking at comparisons, because we look at data all the time between The Class of 2020 and the last year's Class of 2024 rates make sense given the similarity in graduation requirements. We also here in PPS as we should, we do require more rigorous coursework to graduate than Oregon diploma requirements and we continue to work with students to graduate and complete in the fifth year and beyond. I think that's important to note as well. So I do realize this slide may be kind of tough to see, but just wanted to highlight just a few things. The first is just want to call out a few of these a few numbers because these are distinct groups that we do hone in on and pay attention to. Our American Indian Alaskan Native last year's percentage was 47.6. Our black African American was 76.1%. Our Hispanic Latino group was 73.9% and then a multiracial underserved was 79.5%. And those are the four year cohort graduation numbers. I also want to Point out that Native students who participate in Indian education, they do graduate at significantly higher rates than our Native American students who do not participate. And it's a roughly 20% higher rate for those who participate in Native American Indian education. And I will turn this piece over the next slide to Assistant Superintendent Margaret Calvert.

F: Good evening, Directors. Superintendent Armstrong and Student Representative Khun Sabe. Part of what we've done over the number of years is look not only at graduation rates, but measures of post secondary readiness. Students demonstrate post secondary readiness by meeting one or more of the criteria of the six criteria that you see in front of you. These criteria came through our high school success plan, which high school principals, along with central office staff, originally built in response to Measure 98 funding that looked at high school success. We update the plan periodically. We're in the midst of a plan that I think runs from through 2020. There are specific strategies about how do we prepare students for post secondary success. When you look at these six measures, just want to point out that number two up here about completion with a C or better of three or more International Baccalaureate courses. We have two high schools that provide IB coursework, and that's at Cleveland and at Lincoln. We have the remainder of our high schools offer either Advanced placement courses or dual credit courses. And I just want to also share that dual credit courses are earned in a couple of ways. Some of them are on campus, so at a school site. And that's some of the numbers that you will see. And then with Jefferson and the middle college, the students also take classes at pcc. So some of those data are a little harder to capture because that's captured on the transcript and not necessarily in the other ways that we measure. So as we go through some of the dual credit courses that we see in real time, like enrollment does not show up for all the students at Jefferson, but on the transcript they're there. So you'll see slightly two different measures as we go through the other piece that almost. Yep. The other piece, I just want to say is that there's the career Technical pathways where we see three or more courses in the same pathway. And we are very aware of the graduation data around successful completion of the CTE pathways and that it makes a dramatic difference in students graduation and post secondary success. And then finally you will see the fifth piece is around the seal of biliteracy, which I'll speak about a little bit more on the next slide. And then the sixth piece is around performance on nationally normed standardized tests. So what you'll see Here is over the past four years post secondary readiness in the overall rates in this particular slide, the darkest purple is four years ago and the lightest is most recent for the class of 2024. So we see that postsecondary readiness over the past four years has changed and has decreased somewhat over the past four years. We are seeing that the AP and IB attainment last year was comparable to four years ago in 2021. Overall, it is how that shows up and is broken down by students by race. We're not seeing the same level of performance by race as we are by our white students and our multiracial, not historically underserved. There are some specific strategies that we're using to address this that I want to speak to and that I also want to speak specifically about the seal of biliteracy. Some specific strategies that we are using to address postsecondary readiness are some examples that we have are new courses that were offered this year. So for example, at McDaniel High School, all sophomores take AP seminar. At Grant High School, all sophomores Take AP Human Geography and some students are piloting AP seminar at Franklin. What we see as a strategy when we go broadly and provide AP or IB course for all, we're seeing increased enrollment and increased success and it breaks some of the predictability by race. At Cleveland, at the junior year, we're seeing that they are using not only junior language arts but also biology for IB for all and that that is a strategy. We're starting to see again some success from students across racial categories and also students receiving special ed services and yellow. The other part that I would just say that when we look at courses across grade level at a grade band at Jefferson, you have reading and writing 115, which is the junior language arts class, and then Senior Inquiry, which is a college level class at the senior year. So where that entry point is, we're seeing at McDaniel, they're looking at sophomore year at an AP for all course. At Cleveland and Jefferson, for example, we're seeing an IB or dual credit for all at the junior year. And then we see a lot of college level coursework at the senior year across a grade band. The key is to remove barriers which leads to focused preparation in the freshman and sophomore year so that students can not only access college level coursework and advanced coursework, but then find success. These measures are for students that have C or higher in the courses. So in those realms we are also doing things about how we how students enter high school and then how are we providing critical supports so that we can address their gaps, learning gaps that may be coming out of the pandemic, so that we can accelerate learning, change trajectories and have students be prepared for to access and complete successfully college level coursework. I want to turn it over to my colleague, Dr. Philippe Hustich.

G: I'll talk a little bit about some of the work that we're doing across the 912 spectrum to make sure that our students are ready for graduation and beyond. So in the next slide you can see a visual that represents our college or post secondary readiness continuum. We'll talk more about this in April where we'll dig even deeper into ninth grade success, Connecticut and ap. But we just wanted to offer a brief overview this evening. So as you can see, post secondary readiness begins with our 8th to 9th grade transition, which includes our 8th grade success teams, counselors and teachers collaborating with each other, as well as LEAP into ninth grade, which is our summer program. In ninth grade, all of our students are assigned to a community, which means that for the most part, students share the same group of core teachers. Our 9th grade success teams meet regularly to collaborate, to review student data, to provide interventions, and to build relationships. Our high school students, especially 9th and 10th grade, are expected to receive high quality instruction through the adopted curricula and to be provided with the support they need to be successful for advanced coursework starting for the most part in 11th grade. All of our high schools offer CTE and advanced courses as we see these as essential components of the high school experience. Throughout high school, students also receive career exploration and post secondary advising as well as activities connected to their post secondary plans. Next slide. So here you can see information about the college enrollment trends for our students. This data comes from the National Clearinghouse. There is a lag, so the numbers that you're looking at for 2324 are not entirely accurate. They will go up by a few percentage points. As you can see, there was a noticeable dip for the class of 2020. Perhaps not surprisingly, since then enrollment rates have begun to rebound and while the overall college enrollment rate has not reached the pre pandemic levels, we are seeing some promising results for the four year college going great both for overall students and especially for historically underserved students. So as I mentioned before, we'll come back in April to provide more information about CTE, AP as well as 9th grade success. But we're also open to answering questions this evening if you have any.

A: Thank you questions.

start time: 341:58:30.000
end time: 347:38:40.000
confidence: 0.98
H: I have a question. Do we have an Idea, it's around the numbers of students that are homeless and how that might impact the graduation rates because I believe there's additional supports for homeless students. But do we know what the impact of that universe of students is on the graduation rate?

start time: 347:47:40.000
end time: 350:58:40.000
confidence: 0.97
F: We have the state as part of the reporting process does include a graduation rate for homelessness. I don't have it in front of me, but we certainly can get that for you.

start time: 351:26:30.000
end time: 357:01:34.000
confidence: 0.96
H: I had another question about Jefferson students. Do we know out of the census there, the population, how many are actually taking advantage of the dual credit and then how many African American students are taking advantage of the dual enrollment opportunity? So we can. If you don't have that, I would take that information later as well.

start time: 357:03:02.000
end time: 381:23:00.000
confidence: 0.95
F: I think we can speak in general terms and I'm happy to get you specifics. So one of the pieces that happens for, for Jefferson in particular is that there are dual credit courses that happen at the junior year. And language arts, it's reading and writing 115. That is a dual credit course that is taught on campus with pcc. It's aligned to PCC curricula. And then in the senior year, all students take PSU Senior Inquiry, which is then with psu, which includes language arts and social studies. So at the broad space of that is all students. So this is part of the middle college. It's not a program, it's a school. It's the entire school. So everybody's expected to take advantage of the classes. What is less clear in the data that we're showing and sort of a little harder to track is are the pieces around when students are taking classes at pcc. Right. So that's what's unique about the setup at Jefferson is that you have students taking dual credit on the Jefferson side of the street, but then also walking across and taking classes at pcc. And those get transcripted. They're not in our data system in the same way. So it's lagging for us to gather that information. But we certainly can get you some more details about the percentage of students are taking advantage of and completing the middle college diploma, which ties to a minimum of 12 college credits prior to graduation.

start time: 381:24:20.000
end time: 383:30:40.000
confidence: 0.97
H: Oh, fantastic. Yeah, I was really curious. I didn't realize that classes were offered on both sides of the street. So thank you for clarifying that.

start time: 385:01:00.000
end time: 393:16:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I kind of want to dig in on funding for some of the programs that you think have been really helpful. Particularly I've been thinking a lot about measure 98, which I have. This assessment assumption has been really helpful in helping us to have Both supports towards increased graduation rates and CTE. So I'm just curious what impact you think Measure 98 has had on these programs and then I might ask some follow ups related to other funding streams and if they have a role as well.

start time: 393:34:30.000
end time: 405:43:06.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Yeah, I'm happy to speak to that. I would say Measure 98 has had a tremendous impact. Our ninth grade communities are funded in large part or exclusively by measure 98. Our college coordinators who are working with a particular focus in supporting our historically underserved students are funded through Measure 98. And we attribute some of the increases in four year college enrollment rates to the work that they and and their teams are doing. So measure 98 has been a tremendous success and there are lots of different iterations and levels of funding that Measure.

start time: 405:43:38.000
end time: 411:30:20.000
confidence: 0.97
D: 98 provides and follow up. I'm just curious if there's funding that comes from the Student Success act because I know they have some sort of dedicated funding that goes to different things. I don't know if it also goes to supporting increased graduation rates or not. And then also if there's federal dollars or grant dollars that particularly support this work.

start time: 412:40:40.000

confidence: 0.93
G: I mean, I'm just trying to learn.

D: Sorry.

start time: 413:31:20.000
end time: 420:29:36.000
confidence: 0.94
G: Yeah. Measure 98 focuses exclusively on high schools and does include 8th grade. Our student attendance coaches are funded through Measure 98. Measure 98 has supported CT expansion. It has certainly supported dropout prevention and increased access and success in advanced coursework. With regards to sia, are you talking.

start time: 420:31:28.000

confidence: 0.85
B: Director split specifically like Student Investment Account?

start time: 421:19:20.000
end time: 422:42:20.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Sia, the Student Success Act. I think it's the student. Yeah, I think the SIA is the account.

start time: 422:55:20.000
end time: 428:56:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So there are specific pieces, maybe not necessarily predicated to high school, but more so on the lower levels in reference to sia. Like if you think about academic interventionists and instructional coaches, those are some big ticket items that definitely lead up to as we think about high school graduation, post secondary readiness.

start time: 429:26:30.000
end time: 438:37:00.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I think the other piece that is new to high schools in the last couple years is Title 1 funding. And so we've had Roosevelt has become a Title 1 high school, for example, and Alliance High School. So those resources allow, you know, focused support for students and connections to school in order to help support students get connected to high school and then also complete.

start time: 438:56:00.000
end time: 450:47:30.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I have one other line of questioning if that's okay, but a few if you'd rather me not. The other question I had was I know that we have a fairly high level of opting out that happens for the OSAS testing and at the high school level in particular. And I was just curious if you think that creates any issues with being able to track where students are or if you feel like there are other mechanisms that you have that can kind of capture that, that help you find those students that need the extra support, especially ones that choose to opt out. So you don't have that particular data point. So what other, what other ways are you getting there?

start time: 451:13:50.000
end time: 451:26:46.000
confidence: 0.90
C: Do you want to go?

start time: 451:27:58.000
end time: 472:38:20.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Sorry, I can start and then Margaret can chime in. I would say yes, I think that is we, I mean, I would say it's not, it's not specific to pps. I think high schools in general struggle with OSAS participation when you don't have that level of kind of norm national assessment that is a data point that we don't have. And so, you know, things that obviously we look like, for example, 9th grade on track is a big piece that we look at. Also the, you know, the infusion moving forward of curriculum bedded common assessments will be a leading indicator, right. Of how we are doing progress wise. And I also say too, we just shared kind of some of the post secondary pieces in terms of students who graduate enrolling in two and four year universities. I think that's an important piece as well. And then also like our kids take the sat, right? I would say pretty consistently because that's just something that we offer. Looking more in depth about how our students are doing on that particular assessment is going to be a big data point for us moving forward as well. And we look at it as well. But I think if we don't get the OSAS participation moving forward, that's going to be a big piece.

start time: 473:14:40.000
end time: 476:29:00.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Student representative Yeah, I think my question is kind of regarding around how many high schools participate in like the partnership with psu, with like the Senior Inquiry. Do you have the exact amount high schools that participate?

start time: 477:06:50.000
end time: 477:19:10.000
confidence: 0.87
A: 3.

start time: 477:29:30.000
end time: 480:55:50.000
confidence: 0.95
G: So Jefferson, Roosevelt and McDaniel all have the Senior Inquiry class, which is a partnership with VSU that allows students to earn I think up to 16 college credits.

start time: 481:13:30.000
end time: 486:23:30.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And then my next thing I know we have cte. It's a really big thing for our high schools. I've heard from lots of middle school students that they really want to participate in like a lot of CTE programs or high schools have. So definitely strongly encourage if there's ways we can kind of include our middle schoolers or other middle schools we have in PBS and CTE programs. I think that would be really helpful for them.

start time: 486:52:30.000
end time: 502:16:10.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Absolutely. We absolutely agree and we want our young people to begin thinking about some possible CT pathways as soon as possible. So those conversations are definitely underway. And also just want to reiterate what Dr. Franco said about the the value and the importance of having a coherent curriculum is that it does provide opportunities for common assessments to be used as a way of assessing and monitoring early and regularly how our young people are doing academically as opposed to waiting until junior year to figure out who is on track or who isn't on track. And so we're building systems that will allow us centrally, but also locally at the school level, at the PLC level, at the ninth grade success team level for teachers to actively reflect on how students are doing with regards to mastering these key essential skills.

A: Thank you. I have a hopefully quick question on page 10 of the presentation. It looks like there's a trend on both sides that there's a decline in two year enrollment in colleges and an increase in four year enrollment in college. I was wondering if you could expand on that. Like what does that mean or if we know yet?

G: I mean what it means is that more of our students are choosing to go to four year universities rather than two year programs. Part of that is exciting because we know that the completion rate of students who are attending four year universities is higher than students who are attending two year schools. The likelihood of them earning a degree is much higher. You're probably wondering about why that's happening and that's a good question. What we can do is look at some of our exit surveys to try to glean a little bit about our students decision making. What I'm taking away from this is that more of our young people have the confidence to embark on a four year post secondary journey, which is exciting and I think a testament to the work that our counselors and college coordinators and teachers are doing to prepare our graduates for that.

A: Thank you. Director Brim Edwards, you have a question?

start time: 528:25:40.000
end time: 561:58:40.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Of course I have questions. Margaret would be disappointed if I didn't. So I'm glad to see that over the last eight years the reach of what students have access to both college and college prep classes, but also CTE classes has expanded. I'm going to also note that I'm disappointed that PPS is proposing no longer supporting all of our high schools with a position for career coordinator. Because I think one of the strengths in the program is if you looked at this data 15 years ago when I was very active in this issue, it was very uneven about what students had access to college prep classes. There were very few CTE classes with the exception of Benson, and there weren't any career coordinators. And PPS made a consistent push to all high schools having both college prep and CTE career coordinators. So I'm hoping in the budget process we don't back away from that. And I've got a. This is a data request I made before the meeting, but I'm going to ask that we get it afterwards since we couldn't have this meeting but because I think it will provide the board with I think more relevant data for us to dive into in terms of what strategies we should be funding and where, you know, if we need to change strategies or accelerate them. But getting the additional data by high school and then the actual number of students who are in each of the. We just have percentages and sometimes that doesn't tell us a lot. But for an example, the reason why I want to know for the high school, so say we have a high school like Cleveland that's doing IB for all is like is that.

D: Are we.

start time: 562:42:52.000
end time: 588:08:40.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Getting then most high school students getting that C or better in what would be a college prep class? And we can't really see that. And so having aggregated data instead tells us that overall the numbers are changing, but they don't tell us that's the strategy that we should have at every high school. Maybe AP for all or IB for all or whatever the version of it, it sounds like we have something, but is that actually effective in increasing students exposure? So I hope we can get that data. And then I had a question about our measurement because just comparing it to the past, in my understanding in the, my recollection is in the past we used to be measuring whether for example, in IB you got a 5 or better. Not going to get mixed up between IV and apart but a certain standard. And it seems like now you're saying the standard is C or better. And I'm. So are we comparing apples to oranges? Because there are different standards. So for example, the standard used to be like most public universities would accept an AP if you took the test AP test of this level or an IBE test if you got this number. And now it seems like what I thought I heard you say is we're measuring it by whether you got a C in the class or better and we've switched off of that other measure.

start time: 588:21:00.000
end time: 619:17:30.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So I think two things. I appreciate the question. I think that as we've looked at, we want to provide access and then also success. Like I think that's what you're driving at and I agree wholeheartedly. Like saying we're going to enroll students in a class is one thing successful saying that they're successfully completing and have an opportunity to get college. The potential to get college credit is a different thing. One of the things that happened as we expanded dual credit opportunities was that we wanted to be able to say, can we compare what this looks like? So it's not quite there, I hear what you're saying. And the dual credit that happens is by a grade and a completion of the course. So we did. We kind of tried to level that so we could compare across. Are we seeing the same level of academic success within the courses? That additional lever that you're asking is what percentage of our students are taking the IB or AP test? And we can certainly provide you with that information as well. It is not 100% of the students. So I think that's to your point as well is that a subset of students actually take the test. We're trying to get to, you know, encourage that. The other piece that I would say is that when we're looking at, you know, dual credit versus AP or ib, when you're talking about what does it mean to earn college credit when you're in a dual credit class, it's performance over time. And AP and IB is performance on a specific date, right? It is on a test. And so I think that part of what we are working towards is one, can we compare across these three measures? And then two, can we refine? So we certainly can come back and say of these students, how many received a 3 on an AP or a 5 on an IB, for example?

confidence: 0.93
C: So you've normed it. So that's all the C or better.

end time: 632:32:20.000
confidence: 0.96
G: They're two slightly different things. One question is how many of our students are earning high school credit in advanced courses? And then the second question is how many of them are going on to earn college credit by successfully passing AP exam with a 3, 4 or 5? I think the measure for the board reporting purposes has always been C or better in these courses. But on the agenda for April, we will dig into the AP data and I'll just tell you that it's looking pretty good.

start time: 632:42:40.000
end time: 643:32:10.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah, I mean, I would hope we do both things as I know having students being exposed to college level courses in and of itself helps them prepare for college level courses. And for many of our students, the ability in a free public high school to earn potentially a whole year of college credit by taking the exams and passing Them is huge. So for me it's like not either or, but like do we have both of those? Because that is a huge gift that we can give to our students if they are earning even three college credits.

C: I was just going to. At some point you said you were going to say something about biliteracy, the seal of biliteracy, which used to be one of the standards. But I don't. Did you say something or did I miss it?

start time: 651:47:50.000
end time: 673:09:38.000
confidence: 0.95
F: It is. I did not say it. Thank you for bringing it back. So one of the pieces that we notice is that of the measures the seal of biliteracy has. Has dropped for us over the last few years. And so we went back through to say what is driving that. And so one of the things that happened is that starting with the spring of 2023, so not this last graduating class, but the previous one, students had to demonstrate proficiency in English as well as their. Their first language. And that what's challenging is that we don't have the same number of ways of measuring English proficiency that we do for other languages, like so the stamp test or using all the other pieces. So you have to create portfolios to demonstrate it in both languages. And that has been a challenge for us to do over time. So we're working to build that back up. But there was a change in what was required by ODE to demonstrate a seal of biliteracy. And the challenge is not in the first language, it's actually in English. And what are the standards that we have to do and what do we have at our disposal to actually demonstrate that? So we're working to buttress that.

start time: 673:10:34.000
end time: 674:46:58.000
confidence: 0.95
C: But they can still earn it. We just aren't measuring or not including it in this report.

start time: 674:47:54.000
end time: 681:49:40.000
confidence: 0.92
F: No, it is actually. It's in the report. It's in the appendices. It's the seal. So it's. It is. We consolidated the post secondary readiness in the slide deck itself, but it's included in the appendices as one of the slides. So I just wanted to note that you see this decrease or in 2023, and that part of it is that it's actually that what the reporting requirements change and we're still adjusting to those changes in the reporting requirements.

start time: 692:35:20.000
end time: 704:05:10.000
confidence: 0.93
F: I think the challenge is what is the four areas. So it's the listening from what has been shared with me is that what's hardest is to get a listening test. So you have to demonstrate it in reading, writing, speaking and listening in order to have the biliteracy. And so again, we're adjusting to making sure that we are. We can do it through portfolio work and there are ways. Mechanisms to do it. We are building that those mechanisms out in order to. Because to all of your point, the goal is to demonstrate and value multiple languages and to see that as an asset for students.

start time: 704:11:30.000
end time: 710:50:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah. And I also like, I forget which one of you said but you want to provide access and success. And so I think I've heard you before say you do a lot of counseling on people who are taking AP courses to make sure they're going to be successful. Is that true?

start time: 711:37:00.000
end time: 727:50:30.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Absolutely. And just to build on an earlier question about how Measure 98 is useful in this regard, one thing that we did last year is to add a position in all of our high schools called Learning Acceleration Specialist. This is building on some of the work that was happening in K8 space and A. Learning acceleration specialists work to provide individual student support to encourage students to take advanced courses. They also work with teachers around professional development and they work with counselors as well. So they are liaison, they are supporting students and they are making sure that our students are not just recruited into advanced courses, but also have the support that they need to be successful in those spaces. So. Absolutely. Access and success.

A: Thank you. Director Hollins, I just have a kind of follow up question with the SEAL biliteracy issue. The guess is that the number of students and their abilities hasn't really dropped over the years as the testing protocol issue. Right. Is because, I mean it's kind of concerning because we drop from like one fifth of our student getting it to like 1/10 and that's kind of a big drop. So if this obviously, you know, from you said ode change in rules, is there something that the board or policy could also help that along? It doesn't have. This doesn't have to be answered now. But something to kind of throw out there is there Something that the board or policy could help along to kind of get this because we would like to recognize that by bilingualism is an asset. Thank you. Any further questions? I want to thank you all for your hard work, this great presentation, a lot of good data, and I'm sure we'll be chewing on this for quite a bit.

D: Bora Project Manager on the Jefferson project. Quick intro as well. Obviously you're going to hear from all three projects. I think we have a little bit more detail in the first one because we've been kind of going at this a little longer. But hopefully some of that background, including kind of the ed spec information will help kind of level set for all three projects. So I'd like to now hand it off to Natalie. Okay, so today we're going to go over the site constraints and cost reduction opportunities specific to Jefferson High School. The PPS Comprehensive Education specifications alignment, the teen parent center, the commitment to PPS climate policy, the all electric infrastructure alternatives to LEED Gold certification and then additional options trade offs under consideration. Kind of in alignment with the board's framework for Jefferson. The site constraints are pretty tight. We have an existing building location to the south of our site. We have a cross block requirements through zoning to connect the two north south streets on our site that flank our site on Kirby and Commercial. We have demolition and construction access requirements because of the existing school. And then we have a smaller building footprint which creates a challenge to fit all of our program elements such as the theater, the main gym, the commons, the health center, the teen parent center and the sped classrooms which all want to be on that ground floor to the right on our screen we're looking at the footprint of Jefferson which is about 145,000 square feet compared to Cleveland which is about 176,000 square feet. And then Ida B wall is at 206. So we have a little bit of a tighter site. Some of the site scope that is not in service to student athletes, athletic teams and is understudied to be removed reduced from the project. We're studying the potential removal and reduction of the new parking area south of Alberta because it doesn't necessarily aid in student athletes and athletic teams. We're looking at a potential reduction of landscape improvements to the Kirby Grove which is the red area to the north of the site on the site plan that's between the existing parking lot and the site because it's not for athletes. And then we're also looking at the TPC which we had as a separate site building but we'll be moving into the school instead to save cost. This is looking at kind of how we're handling program. So this is the PPS Comprehensive Education Specifications alignment. We have an ED spec minimum building that would require 284,000 square feet. At the end of 50% DD, which was our phase that we ended in December, we had an ED spec plus building with 311,000 gross square feet. And then we are working on the program through the Board of Education requested framework. And we are. This says 301 but we've been working on this and we're now at 295, 716 for the gross square footage. And that's a reduction of 15,423. And then the chart to the right kind of showcases how that is differentiated across the program. Elements so helps to align with the Ed Spec minimum. As part of that, we're also looking at potentially adjusting certain programs such as the dedicated community partner spaces including the SEI Coordinator offices. Partner offices are part of the Ed Spec and will remain and then Indian Education Two athletic team rooms, but three would remain Student mediation Office, Student government office, library classroom and school archive room. The areas that will be potentially reduced would be the theater. We were showing 1,000 seats at the 50% DD level, but we'll be reducing 2 to 500 seats per ed Spec. Dance studios will be reduced by 700 square feet each in alignment with theater stage size. That's 500 square feet larger than what JHS has now. General use locker room count would be reduced to 1000 lockers from 1700 and then the choir room would be reduced by 200 square feet to align with Ed Spec. In terms of the Teen Parent center, the Board of Education Framework guidelines state that the project would include a teen parent center if there was a demonstrated need for the school. The team is working with school and district leaders and exploring opportunities and needs for the health center. We're going to maintain the 50% TD size of 1750 and keep that space within the main building and then commitment to pps, climate policy, all electric infrastructure. We're going to maintain that commitment for the school and are only setting building options that maintain that standard. Alternatives to LEED Gold Certification the project will seek sustainable solutions that are practical, maintainable and cost effective. Effective and additional options trade offs to save costs or square footage. The design team is studying VAV mechanical system solutions, structural options and building material selections. In terms of next steps we'll be looking at the building size and the ED specs. We are test fitting the proposed space program into a proposed building footprint that fits within our site and then the Jefferson administration team will be test fitting it to its master schedule with proposed classrooms to the new space program. And then in terms of construction costs the design team will be exploring alternative mechanical and structural system options. And rlb, who is our third party cost estimator is developing a cost model based on updated site plan and space program. Thank you Natalie. Yes, if any questions, certainly for any.

A: One quick question and this actually applies to all the other projects as well. But one thing I'm a little concerned about is kind of the LEE Gold standard because one I guess I have a question about that because I think if I understand correctly the lead gold standard Also is indoor air quality. And I guess my concern is if, you know, reducing LEE Gold standard, could that mean possibly, like, for example, materials with higher VOCs, you know, formaldehyde or other off gassing benzene and things like that? Yeah, I guess that would be my concern. I don't know if again, I don't know enough about LEE Gold certified to make it same, but I'm just curious if you could provide some background with that in terms of indoor air quality.

start time: 901:24:48.000
end time: 912:14:46.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Yeah, now that's a great question. And it's actually exactly what we've been discussing internally with our planning and ED spec and kind of connecting kind of to the instructional side as well, as well as with maintenance, because indoor air quality is critical, but there's also a lot of measures that actually kind of provide additional longevity. And then obviously there's the whole energy efficiency side of things. So in some cases, our standards actually define a lot of requirements like energy efficiency in particular. In other areas, LEED actually provides a really helpful framework. I think, like you're saying, in areas that we don't have, we haven't dialed.

start time: 912:15:18.000
end time: 912:47:02.000

E: In the standards as much or we have a harder.

start time: 912:48:06.000
end time: 918:58:32.000
confidence: 0.96
D: It's a little more difficult to kind of manage or track them. So to some degree, I think we're not looking necessarily at wholesale abandoning of LEED as a system, but we're looking in particular at the certification process. Does that sort of add some additional cost? Well, we know it does to some degree, but is there a way that we can kind of more flexibly use sort of the lead system?

start time: 919:00:16.000
end time: 919:56:56.000
confidence: 1.00
E: Potentially, but I think we see a lot of value.

start time: 919:58:08.000
end time: 939:52:40.000
confidence: 0.97
D: I think that's kind of where we've landed. We've actually compared it to other kind of sustainability systems. And I think the familiarity in house with our design and engineering teams is very helpful, certainly. So I think we're tending to move in that direction. It's just a question of how we monitor and how we kind of track it. One of the things we're trying to analyze with LEED Gold is what are the LEED Gold credits that we would be pursuing just to try to get LEED Gold certification? And so the indoor air quality is a credit that we could or, you know, the concepts in that credit, we can apply them to the project by making sure that we include them in the drawings and specs for the contractor during construction. And we would track it just the same as we would if we were actually going to get LEED certification in the end. So our architects and engineers and contractors are very used to seeing Those requirements around LEED certification and we can very easily incorporate that into the specifications for the project around low VOC materials and indoor air quality tracking and things like that.

confidence: 0.97
H: Yeah, I appreciate your creativity around, you know, building to LEED standards without pursuing a certification because we know that certification there is a cost to it and I'm not sure if, you know, there's a return on investment and we're looking to save costs wherever we can. So if we could build all electric, which is in the plan and to the standard without seeking out the certification, I think that would save us some money. And I think with LEED also, aren't there indoor air quality is one of the elements, but there are multiple elements that you can sort of trade and you can make trade offs in certain.

H: I had a couple questions. One, let's see. Looking my computer went dark on the slide that shows the red, blue, green comparison of the EDD specs to what's in the drawings. Currently. There were two areas where the ED specs are more robust. Those are in the general Ed where it looks like the ED specs call.

D: For.

start time: 959:40:30.000
end time: 972:34:20.000
confidence: 0.96
H: When you're comparing the program 50,000 versus what's in the plan now for general Ed. My comment is that in general Ed and in education support, the spec is higher than and I just question at Jefferson why we would choose those two areas to not build the ED spec. 2. That's just one question. The other one is about the teen parent center. I thought we'd had some discussion about whether or not we're assessing whether there was a need for teen center, especially because we're hearing about fertility rates dropping and teen parent rates have been dropping for many years. And so I thought that that was one area that we had discussed looking at and assessing it on a building by building level. And those are my questions. Thank you.

start time: 972:40:40.000

D: I'm actually going to bring up our program specialist Amber, who's in the audience to kind of answer your question about general Ed versus and education support.

start time: 975:47:30.000
end time: 981:39:38.000
confidence: 0.94
H: Yeah, thank you. I really of all of the on that slide, you know the science. The ED spec has met performing arts, the ED spec has exceeded. But in general ed and education support, which are what we know are needed at Jefferson, are both less than the spec. So that's my question is about why.

start time: 981:40:34.000
end time: 990:32:30.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Would that be so Jefferson specifically has a very robust specific dance program that is not accounted for in the ED spec. And so to retain the spirit and the functionality of that program needing to offset some of that area with some general education or some education support, rather than just adding, if that makes sense. So to bring the total program down to the 295, needing to find ways to reallocate areas to mostly accommodate dance.

start time: 990:39:30.000
end time: 998:18:26.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Okay. I went to Jefferson. So I know very well about the dance program. Yeah, it's a great program. And in fact it was funded by about 300,000 a year in the late 70s when I was going by the National NEA. Okay, so that describes. Then there's the reduction of the capacity of the seats for the theater. Does that also. How does that tie into having this robust dance program? Program but not enough seats for the parents to come and watch their children dance?

start time: 998:20:18.000
end time: 1013:54:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: So my understanding is currently Jefferson does rent the Newmark theater for large dance performances each year. And our previous design did have a thousand seat theater to accommodate those larger performances at the school. I think with these reductions and kind of the assignment, we've been tasked with reducing down to 295 and aligning with Ed specifically, that was one of the elements that did get reduced back down to ED spec. So we're still exploring opportunities to, I think, design a theater that can flex. Like, is it 500 seats? Could it flex up to a little bit more without increasing the area in the footprint? And I think it'll also come down to some of the cost studies that we're working with our RLBR estimator with of what that final size and seat capacity of the theater can be. But regardless of a thousand seat or a 500 seat, that stage and theater can absolutely be designed to optimize dance performances.

start time: 1016:20:42.000
end time: 1019:50:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yes, 500 seats are for new construction, modernized high schools. I think there are some renovated high schools that might have slightly larger capacity, but for new builds like Jefferson, it would be a 500 seat for ed spec.

start time: 1030:52:42.000
end time: 1035:05:16.000
confidence: 0.95
D: The current theater does exceed 500 seats at Jefferson. Now, I believe there's an upper balcony that's underutilized, but the lower level is utilized more and it does exceed that 500 seats currently. So it would be different.

start time: 1035:06:28.000
end time: 1039:32:44.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Okay. And looking at that same chart that Michelle is looking at, General Ed administration and counseling education support are lower on ED spec. Lower than ed specs. Those are mostly rooms.

start time: 1040:02:04.000
end time: 1045:37:50.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Correct. So for the general education it would be offsetting some general education classrooms to support more robust cte, which you're also seeing reflected there. And then the reduction in building support is for the most part a handful of teacher planning spaces that get offset to accommodate some of the others specialized programming at JEP as well.

D: Yes. Just for comparison, our previous design at 50% dd in December had zero teacher planning spaces. So with this reorganization, we've actually re implemented 5 of the 10 ed spec teacher planning spaces to better align and accommodate for the sharing of classrooms at a full capacity. So we're improving.

D: The TPC question, the team parent center question that you had, Michelle. Sorry, Director DePass. We are working internally across all three projects to work with the staff who are responsible for the teen parent program to define what demonstrated need means and to analyze the that demonstrated need at each site to make the determination. So we don't know tonight whether any of these three buildings are going to meet that definition yet or not because we haven't established it.

A: Yeah, thank you. My mistake.

start time: 1068:11:50.000
end time: 1088:08:56.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So I appreciate the questions that have been asked before because it answered some of mine. I have sort of two sets of questions, some specific to Jefferson and then some that are kind of a cross project. So I'll ask it now during Jefferson and I won't ask it later, but they kind of apply to all. And I'll start with that one. There's a couple places in here that it says additional options trade offs. And the design team is studying things like the mechanical system solutions, structural options, building material selections, and then there's also some other items that could be potential cost reductions. And I'm wondering is there like a PPS work group that's sort of sharing across the school rebuild so that each school is not having to do their own sort of investigation and exploring of like what are, what are high quality, lower cost materials or systems. So just that's a general system. More of like how are we supporting the individual projects. And maybe this is a question for you, Stormy.

start time: 1088:10:48.000
end time: 1101:16:44.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah, sure. We are the three modernization projects throughout. Ever since November when we started looking at these cost reduction studies, we've been working extremely closely together along with our colleagues on the fam side. So the ones who wrote the ED specs and understand them really well and all of our lessons learned, as well as our facility standards, which really addresses more of the materials and the quality of our systems, I guess, building systems. So we are, you know, they're not each going back and forth just within their own project silo to talk about, you know, building skin quality.

start time: 1101:17:32.000

F: We're.

end time: 1103:07:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: We're talking about it as a group altogether constantly, pretty much. I'd say three times a week.

start time: 1103:23:00.000
end time: 1116:46:40.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I'm glad to hear that. So shared, shared learning or collaborative knowledge is always better. Let's see. Director DePass asked my questions about the Ed Spec space. The on slide four, this is more the outside space, both PE and sports. It looks like there's some studying of making some reductions, but that they look to be more sort of auxiliary items versus like a reduction in sort of field space or anything like that. So reduction in landscape improvements, change in the parking lot. Lot. So those are things that wouldn't reduce the. Because of course, Jefferson's the school of champions, we don't want to be reducing that outdoor space, right?

start time: 1116:55:40.000
end time: 1117:06:44.000
confidence: 0.99
B: That's correct.

start time: 1117:07:32.000
end time: 1117:18:00.000
confidence: 0.84
D: Yeah.

start time: 1117:23:40.000
end time: 1129:26:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So the reductions are being made are more ancillary. Ancillary, yeah, that's the word. Okay. So I just want to confirm that. And then on the. Just a slightly different variation of the sustainability question, I didn't see in any of the, across the three high schools, any mention of the sort of mass timber versus concrete and steel versus concrete and steel. And that seemed in at least the Cornerstone report, that was a savings place. And I know now with tariffs on steel, maybe it's not a savings place, but it was silent on it. So I'm just curious about the. That particular piece.

start time: 1129:37:30.000
end time: 1136:53:10.000
confidence: 0.98
D: We are studying it. We don't have the cost data right now. That one is because it's not in the ED spec. You know, it's harder to show on a slide. The only information that we will really have about it is related to the cost. And so we're not there yet with the actual cost savings associated with any of the changes to the space program either.

start time: 1136:58:50.000
end time: 1137:39:50.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Well, it looks like Director says, her hand raised.

start time: 1137:52:10.000
end time: 1144:39:10.000
confidence: 0.98
H: I was going to say there is mention in your presentation about embodied carbon, though. And so we might look at the costs as one indicator and we might look at the impact of embodied carbon on the other. So it might be nice to have a nice look at what each of those scenarios, whether it's mass timber or steel, concrete, what the environmental impact and what the financial impact.

start time: 1144:50:50.000
end time: 1144:57:38.000

D: Great.

start time: 1144:58:34.000
end time: 1164:20:39.000
confidence: 0.96
C: And I just. This is one last piece. And again, this, this isn't Jefferson specific, more district specific. And so I want to be really clear, this isn't Jefferson specific because I know you got to set instructions to reduce the square footage, but the school board did receive late this evening or right before the board meeting, a letter from Tamara Brown from the who's the interim Indian Parent Committee chair about them being moved out of Jefferson and sort of once again, them not having a permanent home. And they asked me to read this, but they asked somebody to read the meeting. But instead of reading it, I'm going to ask that we just post it as public comment, if that's okay. It's outlines just there sort of continuing to be itinerant around the district and not having a permanent home. And again, this isn't Jefferson specific. I want to just be clear about that. This is really a, a district responsibility for them to, to have a home. So I, I'm just going to ask to have it, if that's okay, to have it just posted with as public comment to our board meeting. Thank you.

E: Yeah, I'm just concerned about the potential reductions for the performing arts. I believe we heard very clearly from our students their support for those spaces and why they feel like they need it. So I really hope their voices are really a part of this decision making. And then on page six, just for clarity, are the spaces listed there? Are they being reduced or completely removed? I was just wondering if you could provide more or provide me a better understanding on what's happening with those spaces.

start time: 1174:06:18.000
end time: 1194:41:30.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah, I think as we're working through some of the space programs and designs, we're looking at adjusting some of these areas. So while they may not have dedicated space, there may be other flexible spaces that they could be accommodated by specifically SEI and Indian Education. However, the athletic team rooms, student mediation, student government office, library, classroom and student archive room are currently being considered to be removed. I just want to clarify too, that these updates that we're providing you tonight are a pretty, you know, they're kind of a blunt response to the framework. Right. So these aren't anything that, you know, from our standpoint, we consider as decided. These are the framework that we've been given. This is a response to the framework. And so these are the kinds of questions that we'll need guidance from you all to confirm these changes or to make the decision to keep including that first once we have the cost data to go with it.

E: Yeah, thank you. And this is, I think, I don't know who, who just spoke, but I think this is one of the reasons why getting reductions and recommendations from our OSM department was, was so important because now it seems like they're throwing it back on us as far as, well, this is the framework you gave us when it was repeatedly asked, well, what recommendations do you guys have for reductions before we start coming in? And this is. So I don't want, I want to make sure that we're clear. These are based on reductions that we said. But they were asked multiple times, what recommendations does the OSM have for these reductions for reductions to this for the school buildings? And when I say that, I'm saying that as OFM department is the experts. There's, they're the ones who have done seven other schools. We have, we're not experts. We haven't built multimillion dollar buildings. So I hope that this continues to be a collaborative effort in how we reduce these costs and not just try to, not just saying, oh well this is the board gave us and this we're coming back. I'm hoping you also come back with these are our recommendations as well.

start time: 1219:56:20.000
end time: 1245:22:50.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Actually, I'm a little bit confused because the instructions were to design within the framework and I didn't get a sense it was coming back as a cost. It was like, this is doable. We can still build high quality high schools that meet the specifications that we've set in a cost effective way. So that's, I, to me that's from a level setting. I don't see it coming back of like us being like, well, we like this piece, but we don't like that. It's like here's the framework we all like very much committed to the ED specs. We think that every school community deserves to, to have that and we know that we also need to reduce the cost in order to pass the bond. So I just, personally just want. It's hard work and I appreciate it happening, but I don't see this coming back that we're going to be voting on individual items. That's not what the resolution said and frankly that would delay all of our school projects. So I see this as, you know, a continued getting input and keeping in mind our end goal, which is the high quality high schools that is similar to and equitable to what the other high schools got and we're going to have reduced costs because we know we need that because otherwise there are no high schools if we don't pass the bond.

H: I have a comment. So Jefferson isn't on this bond. Jefferson was on the 2020 bond and it passed overwhelmingly, obviously. I also personally appreciate the opportunity to kind of have conversation about this because the buildings ultimately will reflect the values of our community. We're here wearing some hats of representing the community. I also want to just provide some historical context because I've been around a long time and I attended Jefferson, lived in the Jefferson catchment area whenever I've been in Portland. And Jefferson has been disinvested in for decades and decades and the outcomes prove it. And so just as a note to self, I'm talking to myself too and all of us up here and all of us out here. I just want to, I want to just let you know how important it is to invest back in this community to make the high quality spaces, to do not to shortchange the general ed opportunities, to really lean into what it means to make decisions differently than we've been making for about 40 years, maybe 50 or longer. And so, you know, yes, we want high quality, we want a high quality building that can serve the community that lives in and around catchment area. And this has already been approved by voters. So it's just a matter of. I appreciate the conversation because it's a chance to express our values around climate and environment and education spaces and what it looks like to have reduced this and extra that. So I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you. Thanks for putting your time into this.

To make these three schools that haven't been built yet more in line size wise with Lincoln and then figuring out how to make that work. And so I just want to say thank you and I'm really excited to hear from community about what they think about this as we go forward. And that's it. I just. You did exactly what we asked you to do.

E: I just want to respond with that. And this is probably before Director Split's time, but we had asked them to do something before differently and they did not do that. And so when we gave them the framework, now they're coming back to doing based on that. But we had actually asked the OSM department to come up with recommendations that will show a reduce in pricing or reducing the cost of this before we actually gave them the framework. I just want to make sure we're very clear on that. This ain't something that oh, we told them what to do and they're just coming back to doing them. This is after we had asked them to do something, they did not do that and then we gave them framework and then they're coming back under that mantra.

I: Thank you for having us here. So this is our outline similar to the Jefferson Project. We'll talk about site opportunities and constraints as for requested and we will give you an update on the site and building organization and the responses to the board's framework. You will find some similarities between what we're saying and what the Jefferson team said and we'll also give you some next steps for this project. So the IDB Wells site is very different to the Jefferson site. We do have a lot more space, but we have some very significant constraints which are worth talking about, including a 60 foot grade change from the east to the west. So that's about four tall stories just to give you a sense of how much great change that is across this site and that does drive some of the site organization. And the next slide shows some of the existing components on that site, including actually shaded on the west side of the site, the Riki Elementary School. North of that we have some existing fields. And then on the well site itself, the existing building is going to remain occupied during construction of the new school. That in itself is a very significant constraint. And you can see the existing track and field which is now going to stay on the site and is also a significant element. And between those two you can see the Portland Parks and Recreation swimming pool, which is the biggest rock in many ways in the redesign of the site. We have on the north side south facilities southwest Capitol highway, which is the secondary access into this site. The school fronts Vermont street and it will in the future front Vermont Street. But getting access vehicular access, bus access and pedestrian access to and through the site is another one of the major constraints that we are addressing in this site design. And you can see a few photographs. On the right hand side we have that huge grandstand which we'll be studying. There's a farmer's market at weekends, but most importantly that pool that many in the community just love and needs to stay. So here we have before and after. And I have the next slide is a larger after but on the left hand side, the plan for the site that was approved last year. In the comprehensive plan that we are now reviewing, the major change is that track and field, you can see that it was reoriented north south. And instead of that we're now going to keep it as you can see on the right hand side in its existing east west configuration. And we've dotted on in red an outline of the existing school on that right hand side to give you a sense of the relationship of the new buildings to that existing school and how we're threading a pretty fine needle. There isn't much space to put a building on even though this site is huge. And as a result of that, this is a four story school. So here we have in more detail the proposed site plan. The track and field again in its existing location. The parking lot is going to be somewhat expanded to replace spaces that are going to be lost. The existing access road all around the site to the north and around to the east or the right hand side is going to be retained. But we have to re landscape it. So all those little green dots in your tree. And so we're losing parking. Each tree equals one lost parking space. Think about it that way. So we have to replace the lost parking spaces, but we're trying to reduce the amount of site work we were doing previously. There is a plan still to resurface all the fields. Our next slide shows the proposed building massing on this site. So in the foreground we have Vermont street. And that blue block is a four story classroom wing which is cascading down that very steep slope. And to the north of it in yellow we have our athletics facility. That's the two gyms. Wells only has one gym. Right now it's getting two gyms per. That's what that shows. And purple is the new theater, a 500 seat theater and the new band and choir rooms. And between these two sets of program area we have in white kind of tucked between the two, the new commons at the heart of the school. So that's our basic Building organization on the site. Now we're going to transition and talk about the education specification in a slightly different way to how Amber and the Jefferson team just introduced. So we have been instructed in the framework to reduce the building area to approximately 295,000 gross square feet. And so just talking through each of these bars from left to right, the 261,000 gross square foot bars is the existing Ida B. Wells High School. So it's smaller than the proposed education specification which would have the building be 281,000 gross square feet. The approved comprehensive plan from last year set the size at just around 311,000 gross square feet. And so the new board framework directive is to find a way, a pathway to 295 gross square feet. And we've done that in multiple ways. And I just wanted to take a moment and talk about general ed classrooms and to the Jefferson report on its reducing its Gen Ed classrooms. Jefferson and Ida B. Wells both have very elective programs which are recognized in other parts of the SPEC now. So it's electives that are shifting from gen Ed into other places. For Jefferson they shifted into dance, so in performing arts. And for I.W. wells, the electives shift into CTE. Wells has the most robust CTE program in the district with the exception of Benson. So what we are reducing to make our building a little smaller, include reductions in these. I'll just read them quickly. We have a band room. It's smaller than we had intended, but it still exceeds the EdSpec recommended size. We have a lot of CTE spaces. We've right sized those and we've managed to take two rooms out without deleting programs. We have teen parent center reduction that you can see here. We've reduced the number of flexible learning areas, we've reduced the numbers of teacher planning and collaboration spaces, and we have reduced storage. We're still meeting at SPEC in these areas. And then I want to speak about classroom size, general education average classroom size. So this slide represents all of your schools. The orange bars are each of the three schools that are in front of you today. We're all aiming at 950 square feet per classroom as our average general education classroom size. The little lonely green bar on the far right hand side is the existing average at IDB which is 846 square feet. And on the very far left side you can see the education SPEC standard which is a little higher than our 950 square feet. But you can see that none of your modernized high schools have achieved the target that we are committed to achieving in the three high schools that are being modernized now. And now you'll hear echoes from Jefferson here. So this is on the board's framework for climate policy and LEED Gold certificate on the climate policy. We also maintain a commitment to the all electric infrastructure and are exploring alternative mechanical and structural systems. So that's to the mass timber versus steel issue. We're studying those or concrete and LEED Gold. We're seeking sustainable solutions. And I think all of the conversations that happened previously are absolutely pertinent to IDA B as well. On community partnerships for IDA Bay, you have asked for the health centre that we would only include it if there's a commitment from a provider and to the teen parent centre that we would include it only if there's a demonstrated need. And Stormy talked about the demonstrated need issue that's underway right now. IW Wells currently has neither a health centre or a teen parent centre. And so these explorations about need and about providers are extremely important to this community and of great interest. So finally our next step slide and I just want to make a point here. There was a packet that I think was a preview packet that was sent out that had some additional slides which are not part of this presentation and we're not nothing wrong with the content. It was just too much for the time that we have. And so this is my final slide to talk about the next steps. And very similar to Jefferson, we are in the process of test fitting the space program that we proposed into the building footprint and we're feeling pretty confident that we'll achieve that target reduction that framework identifies for us. And the IDB administration is testing its class schedule, its master schedule against our proposed number of classrooms. So that's underway. We can report back on that next time and construction costs. We have Hoffman Construction as our partner in this project and they are in the midst of developing a cost model including looking at predictions construction services. And we had a long conversation today about construction schedule, staging. It's amazing how much detail you have to get into to think about things at a conceptual level. And finally we too bullet before are looking at alternative facade systems, mechanical and structural systems.

E: I actually have a appreciation that for making some of those general aspects higher. And it's great that you actually show us what we actually have done and show us what we are looking to do even better. I think anytime you are building multiple buildings and you, you know, you learn from the first one and then you get better and better and better. So I just really appreciate that part of that. Just showing that, hey, we are doing a little bit better than we did at the other schools for our general aspects and showing us that we don't even have our aspects for general ed at any of our schools anyway. Those things are so important and it's that communication is great. I just have one question. When we talk about the pool and the space around the pool, is there any way to integrate some of the stuff that we need maybe over the top of the pool, or is that just additional cost.

start time: 1488:17:30.000
end time: 1498:58:10.000
confidence: 0.97
I: We are exploring. We probably need to replace the pool support building because the current locker and changing facilities, the pool are in the basement of the existing school which is going to be demolished in order to make way for other site development. And so a new pool support building that will be as minimal as possible will be provided. And we believe that that can also probably be used for school activities in the non pool season, which is the school season. So it works. So that's one area where we can definitely leverage. Building over the pool is probably cost prohibitive, but we'll continue to look for opportunities.

start time: 1499:09:10.000
end time: 1504:25:30.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And the last thing I ask for about this one is when we talk about the elevation piece, I think it was going from east to west, east to west, and it has a 60 foot slope. I'm assuming we're utilizing at the end of that slope as well for space as well.

start time: 1504:45:10.000
end time: 1513:53:22.000
confidence: 0.94
I: We are. We don't want to use the term basement, but we're stepping down the slope and leveraging the slope to maximize how we access the site and how making the most cost effective use of the slope to get the most access to the site, if that makes sense. So when I said that our four story classroom building is stepping down the site, it's doing a step down halfway through its length in order to maximize the use of the site.

It's not grand marshal. That's a parade. Who's the head of the marching band? Drum major. Drum major. My husband was a drum major and he has pointed out that 400 square feet seems very small for a band room. Is that the amount it was reduced or is it legitimately 400ft? If the classrooms are 950, you're saying it's less than half the size of a classroom.

start time: 1551:13:14.000
end time: 1551:41:30.000

I: So I'm sorry if the slide wasn't clear. I can go back to it here. So the Ed Spec band room size is actually 2,200 square feet with an option for a 2,400 square foot classroom.

start time: 1555:34:50.000
end time: 1555:44:42.000

end time: 1559:03:58.000
confidence: 0.94
I: And we aspired even greater than that to a 2,800 square foot classroom, which was approved last year in the comprehensive plan. And so what we've done is we've just pulled back slightly to the larger ed spec room, which is 2400.

start time: 1559:06:45.000

confidence: 0.97
H: Yeah, just a couple of comments. Really great to hear that the students will be left on site and I hope maybe that's a gold standard for our rebuilds when it's possible. We had a former board member that would have been very upset by a small band room. He was a jazz drummer. So at Ida B. Wells when it was Wilson. And the last is a question about geothermal capacity. So if we're building on a slope and we're trying to meet these climate specs, meet our climate policy and our wishes for the future. Is there any way to capitalize on the undergroundness to put in a geothermal system?

start time: 1575:21:50.000

confidence: 0.97
H: Yeah, I know, I'm looking at her and I know that like Portland State has a. They have a system that works, that is a geothermal system. I don't know if there's any others in Portland, but I was just wondering, since we have that slope, if it could be employed.

start time: 1580:51:30.000
end time: 1584:44:26.000
confidence: 0.97
D: The slope doesn't play into it so much as the actual footprint of the site that you have available for the geothermal bores. So it's certainly possible. I think it's probably been studied as far as cost and life cycle cost.

start time: 1584:45:38.000
end time: 1588:26:12.000
confidence: 0.94
I: It has been studied and it didn't pan out. But that doesn't mean we couldn't just revisit it for a moment. And we do have a requirement to invest 1.5% of the project funds in green energy technology. And I believe that geothermal is, I.

start time: 1588:26:36.000
end time: 1589:47:00.000

confidence: 0.96
C: Thanks again for your work. Each of our schools are so different and that really struck me when I looked at slide 7 because I used to take my kids who they went to a very constrained footprint for high schools and when they used to go out to Liberty High School, they were like, is this a college campus? And when I look at this picture, it's like one of the great assets of I.W. wells is just the footprint and what you can put there and all in one place. So I'm excited that you found a way to really utilize all that space in a way to be in service to the students. I asked some other questions that were sort of across the across projects and I may have missed this on number 11, slide 11, under the Climate policy, it says team is exploring alternate mechanical instructional systems. Is that what connects to the all electric system or what systems are you referring to there?

start time: 1610:01:10.000
end time: 1616:53:52.000
confidence: 0.96
I: So to have a mechanical system that is electrical, there are a variety of types of system that one can have. And we had established what we thought was the basis of design in our previous effort. And we've been revisiting that with input from PPS and from facilities specifically about what is maintainable. So there will be an electric system. It's just a question of which electric system. So that's the alternate mechanical system is.

start time: 1616:54:16.000
end time: 1617:43:28.000
confidence: 0.97
C: That cost or function that you're focused.

start time: 1617:43:44.000
end time: 1634:07:52.000
confidence: 0.94
I: On both cost and function and long term maintainability. And then on structural systems. We're actually using for IDA B structural steel as the basis of design for the building, but we will be studying alternatives to that. So that's to establish baseline. But given the situation with tariffs and materials and so on, we need to keep up. We're at the point in the design where we can maintain flexibility. We don't have to make a choice now. We can push that down the road until we have more certainty about price and about appropriate systems and about carbon footprint. And we can do all of that study. We have time to do it. Our team has access to rlb, the third party cost estimator who's doing the estimate on the Jefferson team. And they're doing on behalf of all three projects a study to report on tariffs and the potential risks, including sort of local market report on that. So we're anticipating that we'll see that.

start time: 1634:08:16.000
end time: 1646:32:50.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Pretty soon as well. Great. And then on the health center. So I've had my kids in both schools that have health centers have a school based health center and one that didn't. And I know that currently if you're on the west side, basically if you're at either Lincoln or Ida B. Wells, students who need to utilize the school base health clinic are told to take a bus to go to Cleveland or Benson. So I'm really hoping if there's a demonstrated need, which sounds like there is that a provider. And I'm wondering if maybe not one of you three, but somebody has an update on where we are with securing a provider.

start time: 1647:03:50.000
end time: 1649:12:20.000
confidence: 0.96
D: We don't have an update on the provider. We do have the principal here and I think she might like to say something if that's all right.

confidence: 0.97
D: Hi there, I'm Aisha Conning. I'm the principal of Ida B. Wells High School. Thanks for giving me a couple minutes. We have been working really hard to find a partner for a westside school based health center. We believe there's a great need. We have the largest or one of the largest refugee immigrant populations in Portland attending Ida B.

end time: 1668:19:30.000
confidence: 0.97
D: And oftentimes our students need support, health support, medical support, and are asked to take an hour, an hour and a half bus. Across town there's four school based health centers at four different comprehensive high schools on the east side, all within a couple miles of each other. And there's nothing on the west side. So I have been actively involved in trying to partner with ohsu, Providence, Multnomah county, we definitely need a school based health center on the west side.

start time: 1668:36:30.000
end time: 1680:33:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: And I just wanted to second that. I know that obviously it's a board's decision that fits within your framework, but I think about the time that's needed to complete the design and then the amount of years it'll take to get to completion. And I just certainly want to believe that there'll be some possibilities and partnerships within the, you know, few years. And so I really hope that you all take that into consideration when thinking about your framework. Is that just the timing of things and the guidance of a confirmed partnership and a small window and then what may come to be before the high school is even complete.

confidence: 0.97
D: Thank you on that subject and great to see you, Principal. Thanks for being here on that subject. I certainly agree that we should have a student B based health center on the west side. I'm wondering about if there's a way to be flexible about what, where exactly it is. I realize we're talking school based health center and it should be at the school. I totally understand that. But with the site constraints that you've mentioned, is it possible this is something that becomes something that's on the massive amounts of property PPS has in that area that can be built separately later, or is it something we can look at like I think about where that immigrant population is centered in the community and we have Jackson, which has a surplus of space. I mean we just fit another middle school in there recently. So I'm just curious if there's any room to ever be. It looks like she looks like she's going to answer if there's any room to be creative or if it has to be in this building.

start time: 1696:00:10.000
end time: 1702:01:00.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Well, my hope is that it would be in the building. And one of the things that I heard the team say is that there's a priority for CTE programming. And so I know in definitely spaces that I visited in health centers also serve as workspaces, spaces for students that are in those health pathways. I don't know if that's planned for Ida B.

start time: 1702:01:40.000
end time: 1712:05:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Wells, but yes, absolutely, we have an award winning CTE health occupations pathway and program, the largest in the district. And we're partnered really closely with OHSU for that CTE health occupations program. So we've been courting ohsu. However, there are some funding issues, as I'm learning, always learning in this job, that school based health centers are not particularly profitable. So that's part of our challenge and I wanted to ask Becca to speak to the space, the school based health center space that is in somewhat in the design.

start time: 1712:14:00.000
end time: 1722:56:30.000
confidence: 0.96
I: So in the test fit that we're doing right now, this sort of next step, we are assuming that there is a health clinic. And so we are trying to include it in the building. And while we do have this lovely big. And it could potentially go somewhere else on the site. A reason to have the health clinic in the school itself is twofold. One is students are more likely to engage with the services of the health clinic if it's in the building, particularly students who want to be kind of shy about what they're doing, why they're going, and also because we do have this potential tie in with the CTE program, having it all in one facility is where keeping the kids in the school.

start time: 1723:12:20.000
end time: 1727:29:00.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Thank you. That makes sense to me. And I would just say what you just said was actually kind of what I was asking. Can we be creative and if we can do it within the existing requirement, with existing parameters that we've already been talking about today? All good.

E: And I was going to wait to the end to say this, but I'm going to just insert it here quickly. I hope that. I know that there's also community meetings about just a redesign of some things. I would hope that there are some things, like even going back to Jefferson in the dance or the theater, that what comes up from community is taken into account with at least some flexibility to extend beyond ED specs if there's a trade off on something else. And so I think of Ida B. Wells the same way. And so. And I'm sure with Cleveland there'll be something there too. And I think that that's one of the reasons why we have community groups in the DAGs while still also looking at the framework as a guiding document. But not that we're so, you know, stuck on the framework that there isn't an opportunity to engage in conversation about a, you know. Well, if not that, then what?

E: Yeah. And Director, she basically asked the same question, that we can be creative in ways we can. You know, maybe we use it like for the CTE program. And then when we do get a relationship, you know, to be able to bring it to full usage, then it could be flexible enough to turn into that at a later time.

I: The framework, we've radically reorganized and rearranged the building on the site. It previously had a basement that it still has what it's got a partial subgrade, if that makes sense, because of the stepping site. Other than that, it has no basement.

A: Yeah, I just have one more thing about the health center. I'm fully supportive of the health center. I think it makes sense that we have so many on the east side and none on the west side that we need one on the west side. I guess my question is, does that require an amendment from the board on the language of that or is that because, I mean, like, would it be something that like a demonstrator would need? No.

I think we should design this building with that in mind.

D: I'm Abby Dacey. I'm the principal in charge for our combined Malam Studio Petretti Architecture team. So we will start. I'll start by discussing site constraints. As you know, Cleveland High School is separated across three different sites all along Powell Boulevard, which is a state highway. And so Those sites total 11 and a half acres, which would make it the second smallest site in the district. The school site itself is 4 acres. This view is from the opposite, excuse me, from the opposite corner of the other image. This is from the northeast side on 28th Avenue looking towards the existing building. The two to three story existing building fills the entire site. As you can see, there is next to no secure outdoor space for students to be outside of the school. There's also no extra space for construction logistics and things like that on this site. And the reason I'm revisiting that is just to help understand that the framework we set up a year ago in the comprehensive plan set the stage for a very efficient school plan that takes advantage of the site. What you can't really see in this image is that it is also sloped. There's about a 20 foot grade change between 26th Avenue and 28th Avenue. And we are. That's both a challenge and a kind of a blessing because it's allowing us to make some different decisions about where things coincide with grade. So on the right you see our proposed design for the school. This is very similar to what we shared almost a year ago with the comprehensive plan. And so we've organized the school into two very efficient buildings on the north and the south side of the site. They frame an outdoor space which now creates the only outdoor space available to students, a secure outdoor courtyard. These buildings are also organized to allow. They're four stories, so they're very efficient. And then they allow daylight to all the learning spaces. And what that lets us do is create this central courtyard space which allows learning and teaching to flow out into the outdoor space space lunch to come into the space, which is a function that the school does not have now. So looking ahead to the board's framework, we have been going through, just like the other two schools, very similar sets of elements. And we will briefly walk through those recommendations right now. So for contractor cost reductions, we're working with Skanska USA Building, who's our CMGC.

E: The, the function of the contractor fee does reduce when the overall project construction cost reduces. And then within equity and contracting, we have acknowledged that there's a premium cost.

D: In that plan to meet our aspirational goals for certified business participation. And we're just working with Skanska to put together a procurement plan that can maximize those goals, but to minimize additional costs. And so we'll be coming back with.

E: More detail on that.

start time: 1869:05:50.000
end time: 2392:59:42.000
confidence: 0.97
D: So we, you know, with our constrained site, we've had, I would say, limited opportunities in terms of where we could build, which is why we came up with this very efficient set of four story buildings. So what you see here in yellow are the zones that will be reduced in terms of square footage. We've found 20 or we have reduced the building by about 23,000 square feet to bring it to the 295,000 square foot target. So while these little yellow slivers look rather small at this scale because they are each four stories tall and entire building width wide, they actually add up to a full amount of savings. And we're able to meet the requirements of the ED Spec as well as the Cleveland specific needs in this. We do have some subgrade space because as we mentioned, we have the sloped site. We were able to reduce the amount of that space. Most of it is actually in already excavated space where the existing locker rooms are underneath the Cleveland gym. We also will just note that the electrical room for an all electric building is slightly bigger than what the ED spec allows. About 1,000 square feet bigger. We've been able to work that in and still maintain the 295,000 square square feet. So just in terms of specifics, what we are imagining might be changing in our proposed plan would be changes to three general education classrooms and one science room. So these would bring those counts down to the ED Spec recommendation number. Previously, the numbers had been based on some of the preferred ED Spec spaces and some of the lessons learned in past projects, which is why the program square footage was above what we're proposing today. Some changes to extended learning spaces, the size of the athletic spaces and the performing arts spaces. Again reducing those to the ED spec recommendation numbers rather than the preferred or the lessons learned spaces, looking at the loading dock and some of the custodial back of house spaces for more efficiencies as well as the high paying lobbying jobs after they've been in Congress for a while. And so I certainly see how they operate in other settings. I do find it interesting. I don't know how to think about it at this point, but the idea of somebody who's leaving and wants to go back to teaching, I see what you're saying about the interview process being challenging in that case, but also if that's someone's livelihood and they've taken a leave to serve on the board or something. So I will take advantage of the 21 days before we can reconsider this and listen to public comment very carefully because just because I could see somebody being in that position and maybe there's a place where we can find some sort of, you know, process point where like we have this as the general rule of thumb but there's some sort of process for an exception or something like that. I don't know, I'm just throwing things out there, haven't thought it through. But I'll be paying close attention for the next 21 days. And like I said, it's, it seems like standard practice to me because I'm used to it at the legislature but open to a conversation about it as we pursue our second reading.

But I would definitely love to hear if the superintendent has a perspective or any thoughts around this. Oh, I don't have any thoughts or perspective. Just thinking of myself eight months, 18 days in the role. I don't have the history or the experiences at this point to determine if the policy is helpful or hurtful.

end time: 2553:57:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Okay. All right. So as you can see here, you know, our focus throughout this entire budget process as we're looking at an immense reduction, is to maintain investments that have the biggest impact on student outcomes while supporting fiscal sustainability in our system. And then with that, you'll see throughout this presentation this notion of school flexibility and stability as much as possible. Next slide. So I just want to just highlight just kind of a few big pieces. Here is the first bullet in terms of we intentionally did not raise class size across the board. Think that's, you know, a big piece and that is very specific to all grade bands. We did see some bumps in FTE removed based on school status. So in regards to CSI or TSI designation, we have retained strategic school supports, although in some cases at a decreased level. For example, all schools will have at least a 0.5 FTE for a school based instructional coach, which if you talk specifically with principals, they'll say that the instructional coach model has been extremely supportive. Also, the flexibility was added to allow principals to accommodate needs in their schools. With some allocations, enrollment decline contributes to about 9% of school based FTE reductions. And then we have adjusted our preliminary school staffing reductions the plan based on feedback. So adding overall 37 FTE specific to schools and that ranges specifically to instructional coaches, student interventionists, also adding back some non formula APs and then also some very school climate support specific to the middle school pre kindergarten programming is continuing at the same level. And also our equity formula, which we're very proud about is also not changing. Next slide. So if you look here at the elementors going specific to grade bands, we'll talk a little bit about this. So you know an adjustment we did made in terms of staffing allocation was this notion of blending in upper elementary grades. And so that is very specific to 4th and 5th grade or I would say this to upper grade. So that's three, four, five. Right. In terms of the intermediate levels, kindergarten educational assistants are still in play. And that's. But that's very specific to Title 1 schools with class sizes of more than 20. Also schools will retain support from their instructional coach. That was an add back where all of our elementary and middles will carry an instructional coach. Also, our IB supports are no longer allocated due to lack of IB pathways to upper grades. At the middle school level, a minimum class size of 15 students has been established. So if you think about the staffing ratio and again when we say this is that we have to look overarchingly at how we schedule. And so the reality is if we have class sizes lower than 15, we really have to look on whether or not we offer that class right in order to save money in that area. Dual language immersion supplemental resources are aligned to enrollment based need. And so I mean that's a big piece. We believe in our DLI programs of course, and so we are staffing them accordingly. And that's based on enrollment. So we're not seeing a reduction from that vantage point. The Title 1 supplemental resources are reduced from a base of 2 to 1. So what we've generally done in the past is that we've applied what we call a bump, right regardless of enrollment. And so we're taking away 1.0 of that FTE in regards to the bump for title schools, Schools will retain support from instructional coaches and they also received discretional FTE as I mentioned a little bit earlier, to be used for either instructional coach, an RJ coordinator, school climate specialist or social worker. So that's where that flexibility piece comes into play. So we coined that in terms of allocation as a 1.0 climate addition which they have some flexibility to use based on some school autonomy there. Next slide. So at the high school, and I just mentioned the minimum or target of a minimum of 15 and I will say that there are exceptions to that because we're very cognizant about loss of program specifically at the high school level. And so there are exception pieces in play there where if you're going to offer a class of lower than 15, it has to be approved by a senior director of schools, the reduction of the career coordinator funded by general fund. So high schools, they also, and I want you to. So high schools also do have support of a measure 98 funded college coordinator as well. And so what we did here is we applied a 0.5 license FTE allocation which schools could ultimately determine on how to use. So if they wanted to convert that, for example to a 1.0 PFSP position, they could do that. So they have flexibility in regards to that.

start time: 2557:46:24.000
end time: 2608:23:50.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Correct. So that is correct. So the 0.5, we, we allocated a 0.5 licensed allocation and so that is a pat potential license. However, if a school wanted to say convert that to a full time, they could, but it wouldn't be a license. It would be a PFSP position. Multilingual learners. So itinerant staff will continue then. This is a piece too with our mls. We want to make sure that all of our MLS across the district are receiving support. So we do have itinerant staff because you know how we allocate, you know, it's not always in 1.0 increments because we just don't have the numbers across the board. And so we may see a school needing a 0.25 right. Support for a ELD teacher. And so that's where their itinerant staff comes into play. Weighting has changed. So all schools receive FTE based on student need and then for special education. And I know chief Buno talked about this at his last presentation, is that we. There are no significant changes planned in terms for special education. Next slide. Do you want me to talk about this? Okay. I guess I'm just running through it, this whole thing. So central office personnel, non personnel budgets will be reduced next school year and non personnel reduction. So we're focusing on, you know, contracted services also pd professional development and travel. We are still. And you know that Chief Morrison will go a little bit more into this in terms of, you know, we still have more decisions to make from a central office perspective and that information will be coming. Next slide. So as you can see here, this first piece, and we did this last year as well in regards to the 40 million in our principals or our schools wanted to see this as well. So we have gone through an immense budget engagement process, not only with community and stakeholders, but with, you know, building staff, building leaders. And so at our first proposal, you could see the percentage here of what it looked like in terms of the reduction. Percentage wise, it was roughly a 70, 30. But based on feedback and more engagement sessions, we're able to close the gap in regards to the percentage of central office versus school related reductions.

D: Before we. Sorry. Deborah Caffori, Chief of Staff, before we get into this slide, I just wanted to give you a little bit of a federal update. After weeks of uncertainty at our federal level, the Congress did pass a continuing resolution which allows fiscal year FY 2025, which we're in right now, appropriations and provides level funding for most of our key K12 formula programs, including Idea, Title I, Title 4A and Reap.

Also to note at a state level, on Thursday, our attorney general, dan Rayfield, alongside 20 other Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's plan to dismantle the US Department of Education.

start time: 2721:11:50.000
end time: 2730:26:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I have a few. We can keep them tight. I know it's late and I want especially Director. I'm always confused about people's titles. Leader, Chief. Chief. Thank you. Everybody's different. Chief Morrison. I know. Especially you get sleepy on us just fine. Sorry. We always have you late. So I'm curious, a few small things. How do you forecast about the classes under 15, like in advance? Do you just look at what enrollment was this year and decide to cut them for next year? Or do you have to wait and then make like fall decisions?

start time: 2730:29:20.000
end time: 2735:42:18.000
confidence: 0.97
B: No, that's a really good question. So we get enrollment projections via Portland State. And so that generally happens in the fall. And so based on those specific projections, that's how we staff. Right.

start time: 2735:43:14.000
end time: 2736:33:30.000
confidence: 0.98
D: For the 15 students in middle school and high school.

start time: 2736:35:30.000
end time: 2754:40:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So what happens is that. Because generally what happens as a school is that they get their staffing overarchingly based on the number of kids that they're going to have. So if I'm talking specifically at the secondary level, then they kind of go through and they kind of had preliminary conversations of what potentially a schedule could look like. And then they have to decide. And remember, at the secondary level, kids forecast already, right? So rising sophomores or rising juniors, rising seniors. They're forecasting for certain classes like we know we're going to offer, obviously the core. Those are very specific things. But you can collapse core classes as well. Where we get into sticky situations is around elective classes. Right? And so those are the pieces because that really, truly depends on a student's level of interest. And so if a student if students forecast at a lower level principals now we're saying is if you forecast for a certain elective class and it's below 15, you can't offer that class.

start time: 2754:46:20.000
end time: 2755:06:44.000
confidence: 0.84
D: We make that decision now.

start time: 2755:08:12.000
end time: 2755:47:48.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Right. Unless there's an exception.

start time: 2755:49:24.000
end time: 2755:57:40.000
confidence: 0.64
C: Great.

start time: 2755:59:40.000
end time: 2765:23:10.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Which just is a great opportunity to understand then why when high schoolers are coming home saying I can't get out of this elective class and I have to wait a week or two. It's because school schools were staffed based on the course selection sheets or the forecasting and the enrollment that came in. Right. And so that's how they spent their funds, if you will, their budget. And so it tends to be a robust conversation in the fall when it's time to get the schedules.

start time: 2765:36:50.000
end time: 2776:04:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Thanks for clarifying. I'm also curious about the I know you had mentioned this before, but now thinking about it again, the forecasted 25% title one reduction amount that you're already accounting for in the budget. When I found myself asking a question I know you don't know the answer to. We won't probably ever know for sure whether we'll have that 25% or not. But do you have a time when you'll feel comfortable saying that still hasn't been cut so let's proceed as though it hasn't been cut. Or do you think we'll just hold on to that money just in case something happens mid year?

start time: 2776:11:40.000
end time: 2777:45:40.000
confidence: 0.94
C: That's a good question. And I think we're working through that as with as administrators and how to.

start time: 2778:57:00.000
end time: 2781:10:12.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I do think that we're planning to staff at that level knowing that if we do get affirmation of a higher level of funding, then we could choose.

start time: 2781:11:16.000
end time: 2782:39:50.000
confidence: 0.98
D: How to supplement what's happening in schools. It's very difficult when it's tied up.

start time: 2782:40:30.000
end time: 2785:10:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: In staffing specifically to be more flexible. So this is the time that we're making those commitments to folks who are going to be working for PPS next year.

start time: 2785:21:50.000
end time: 2792:40:00.000
confidence: 0.95
D: And then finally one more question. Then one very quick comment. You talked about flexibility being extended to principals and I was just curious if you've revisited any policies or expectations to make that happen or was it just the ones that you mentioned as far as like allowing 3, 5 blends to be flexible and instructional coaches, Was that it on the flexibility or was there a more general generalized flexible approach?

start time: 2792:42:00.000
end time: 2814:27:22.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, I would say that that the overarching rule is principals do have flexibility when you're talking very specific to like general gen ed funds. But when you're Talking about like the student investment account sia, there are specific stipulations that we have to abide by. So for example, there's flexibility. We're saying like at the elementary level, I'm just using this as an example is that you have to maintain a base. So they were allotted, were able to add back another 0.5 to make their, their instructional coaches whole at a 1.0. We were also able to specifically add back based on data like a 0.5 interventionist SIA because they're funded through SIA. That means they have to be interchangeable between the two. So we couldn't say, hey, I'm going to take 0.5 of that and then allocate it to be a classroom teacher because that's SIA has specific guidelines for that. But I will say this is that if you, you wanted to take, you know, if you wanted to collapse a class size and maybe use some of that FTE to complete another support position like an AP or something like that, there's flexibility on how to do that.

start time: 2814:29:06.000
end time: 2822:58:20.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Thank you for sharing. And I think a couple weeks ago I made the point about trying to see more flexibility on arts and music and it doesn't sound like you did in this case, but I'll continue to mention it whenever I have a chance. And then finally my comment. I really hope we're doing some action alerts because PPS has like a huge email list, I assume ahead of the state school fund hearing might be an interesting opportunity. Okay, great, great. Thank you for being on top of that. Love it. Thanks so much for letting me take a lot of time. Amnu Any questions?

start time: 2823:13:20.000
end time: 2836:31:38.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I'll just, I have like a quick question, I guess. I know there's you know, a lot of I think conceptions out there, you know, about blended classrooms and just I just want to say, you know, straight up front, blended classrooms can work really great. I've seen them be very successful and has been very helpful for a lot of students, especially very with very diverse learners. So I just throwing that out there. Blended is not a good or bad thing. It can be great. I do, I guess my ass is concerned when we have teachers that, you know, there's a difference between a teacher that has been teaching blended classrooms for years versus one that is transitioning from teaching a single grade to blended. Are there like. I guess this also depends on school site but other. Do we have supports for teachers that are transitioning to a blended classroom?

start time: 2836:34:34.000
end time: 2852:56:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yes. And so when we decided to put forth this proposal, we wanted. Sorry, the whispering I heard Chief Ghafori. So one of the big pieces. Right. Because we don't. And I agree with you. And we also do have blends currently. Right. In some schools. Astor is one, for example. Beach is another. Been very successful in regards to the blends. But when we presented this as a potential avenue to save, it's going to be coupled with support. And that includes OTL support in regards to curriculum making. Sure. Because that's. It's another piece. And I would say also OSP and OTL support in regards to what does the pedagogy look like when you're talking about having a blended classroom? And so we're still working out maybe more logistics in regards to a PD plan of support. But yes, long story short, yes, there will be support.

D: Is that correct?

start time: 2856:02:30.000
end time: 2864:19:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So they were given. They were allotted. So they do have a college coordinator Support via Measure 98 funding, but that's entirely separate. What we allocated was a 5, which they can license FTE, which they can use for a college coordinator or career coordinator. So it really depends. And this where some of the flexibility comes into play, where based on the school's needs, high schools can determine how to use that.

start time: 2864:38:50.000
end time: 2866:10:26.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Okay, but with both sources of money, Everybody will get one.

start time: 2866:12:58.000
end time: 2868:41:10.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Everyone will get. Everyone has been allotted a 0.5 licensed FTE for that. Okay, but it's flexible.

start time: 2868:52:10.000
end time: 2870:42:40.000
confidence: 0.97
C: And you said the equity formula stays the same. Can you explain exactly how that works?

start time: 2871:00:20.000
end time: 2894:03:58.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Yeah, I will try to explain it. All I can say is this is that. And Dr. Adams and his team could explain a little bit more about the formula in itself. But I can. What I'll in a sense is what we say with the equity formula is that it's a formula derived to basically follow schools with our most historically underserved students. So if I were talking specifically at the high school level, we know. So one of the big pieces, like for example, at the high school level, if I were to use grant, for example, which is about 2,200 students, but their school of poverty percentage is roughly around 25%, which previously would not have qualified two years ago for our equity formula or received any additional FTE support. But if 25% at grant amounts to around 600 kids. Right. So that is. So it follows the students. And so with that comes a potential FTE bump in regards to support. So the equity form is intended to do exactly what it's called in terms of equity is really follow the students are most Historically underserved and it really.

start time: 2894:04:54.000
end time: 2894:50:54.000

start time: 2894:53:02.000

C: All right, thank you.

start time: 2896:54:30.000
end time: 2913:40:50.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Let me just. I just want to follow back up on the college and career in. Just to be clear on what's being said is that we had 1.0 allocated out of measure 98 this school year and we had an additional 1.0 out of general funds that funded career coordinators. And so what we did then is say here's a 5 allocation that can be used to either cover an employee that's licensed or full time employee that's not licensed. And that was based on feedback and survey results from our building admin team. So we've heard that some schools have added back a career coordinator, some may choose to do other things based on the needs of their building. And so that's that flexibility piece. But I just wanted to bring that back forth just to be clear on that.

start time: 2913:48:30.000
end time: 2917:41:30.000
confidence: 0.98
C: So that 0.5, when did that get added back? Has that always been available? Because specifically in the staffing manual it says we are not giving schools one FTE for career coordinators.

start time: 2918:25:50.000
end time: 2918:38:50.000
confidence: 0.61
E: Yeah.

start time: 2918:56:30.000
end time: 2923:28:34.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So did the half thing get added later or is it just. You've identified that they got it for something else and now that if they. And they were using it for something else that they would have to go cut the something else in order to.

start time: 2923:31:22.000
end time: 2927:46:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, so what the change was just based on the feedback was the flexibility to use that again to make a 1.0 career coordinator or utilize the 0.5 AS. As the college coordinator.

start time: 2927:49:20.000
end time: 2932:45:20.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I'm still confused. You get subsequent to our last meeting, they were given a 0.5 or it's just like you have the flexibility to use that and whatever. But they already had it and then whatever they were using it on, they would have to stop doing that. And.

start time: 2932:46:00.000
end time: 2937:06:04.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Yeah, so it's not an ad. We didn't add back what we did do because it was, it was part of the proposed administration. Initial reduction was the 0.5. What we did say based on the feedback is the principals were asking some more flexibility on how to use that.

start time: 2937:08:52.000
end time: 2937:44:44.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yeah, let me just.

start time: 2937:46:12.000
end time: 2940:24:40.000
confidence: 0.95
C: But they're not getting additional. They didn't get additional 0.5. It's like you have flexibility to use it, but it's not like they got a 0.5 that then they could use.

start time: 2940:41:40.000
end time: 2956:26:50.000
confidence: 0.96
E: I see your point. I think the. I see where I may have created some confusion. Let me just try that one more time. I'm sorry. So the thinking of a school that had a 1.0 allocation out of measure 98 for college coordinators. Right. And this is the licensed one and then a 1.0 allocation for career coordinators, which is the unlicensed. And so the flexibility was that you're no longer obligated to have that 1.0 be that career coordinator. If you wanted to do a 0.5 college coordinator to add as opposed to the career coordinator, you now have the flexibility to do it. So.

start time: 2956:28:50.000
end time: 2957:03:10.000
confidence: 0.91
C: But then you wouldn't have a career coordinator.

start time: 2957:12:50.000
end time: 2959:21:50.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Well, so you're right. This is from buildings in terms of some of the things that came up for them and ways in which they wanted to staff their schools.

start time: 2960:06:10.000
end time: 2974:47:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And I will say too throughout the process like this is these are one of the pieces around engagement and seeing, you know, with buildings on. I mean, the, the reality is that we're also able to. Because part of the initial proposed reduction was to, for example, increase class size at the high school level by one. And so by doing things like this, unfortunately with things like the career coordinator is that that allowed us some flexibility to be like, okay, we're not going to increase class size by one overarchingly at the high school level. But at the same time, what you've heard is that that increased flexibility, you know, without having certain stipulations on how to use the less FTE they do have, has been appreciated.

start time: 2974:49:40.000
end time: 2992:51:00.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Right. And I know we're hyper focused right now on the college versus career coordinator. I just want to take the opportunity to say that both roles are valuable in the system and that isn't the only decision or flexibility that principals ask for. There's other positions out there where, you know, how they choose to expand their FTE based on the needs of their building will look different from school to school. But what we're already hearing when we asked is that there's some functions, I can't say across 100%, but most of the schools will continue to have career coordinator type functions. And so we can also bring that back a little later once, you know, all everything is settled. But so, yeah, I just want to make sure it's not like that's the only flexibility the high school principals had. I know it's one that's come up for the board, so to tease it out a little bit more, I think made sense, but there are some. It's a totality of FTE that they could choose to allocate based on their needs.

start time: 2996:50:40.000
end time: 2998:39:00.000

start time: 2999:14:50.000
end time: 2999:45:22.000

end time: 3006:41:48.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Impact of the reductions between the change in enrollment that a school might be experiencing, the other factors, title changes to that school, so that we could see the total number of positions that would be impacted.

start time: 3006:43:54.000
end time: 3007:08:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: And then we started to work through.

start time: 3007:09:20.000
end time: 3009:45:12.000
confidence: 0.97
C: That to minimize the impact to schools. So there was a lot of thought that went into that and a lot of feedback that we've heard to help.

start time: 3009:45:36.000
end time: 3010:32:08.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Us be very thoughtful about how we're.

C: Targeting federal funds moving forward.

start time: 3011:16:00.000
end time: 3023:53:30.000
confidence: 0.91
E: And then my next question is towards like the superintendent, are you planning on having any reductions or cuts towards cabinet level positions? Oh, that's a, that's a great question. So across senior leader you say cabinet though I need to think about that. There has been some changes and I'm in April we'll be presenting a updated org chart to show where some of the reductions existed and a redesign of a different approach to work. So I'll be prepared to bring that in April. And then my next question is what does like the budget engagement look like between principals and their school communities?

start time: 3024:19:10.000
end time: 3042:31:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, it's a great question. So we create very specific slide decks for schools. Very specific, first for staff, but then also for community. And so there is an expectation obviously that we need to hit all community stakeholders within the school. And so whether it be through PTA meetings, primarily through PTA meetings is where we're finding a lot of those conversations because we're talking about community members, they're very vested in exactly what is happening and they know because principals are very forthright with delivering some of the information and how it impacts. But when we do a staff, when we do like for example our isr, our staffing release to principals the next day is when they're engaging their staffs. And so we have a very, I wouldn't say rigid, but we have a timeline with a level of engagement. But then also we provide talking points and slide decks for everyone.

start time: 3042:36:40.000
end time: 3043:39:40.000
confidence: 0.89
E: And what does that engagement look like between the principals and like their student body?

start time: 3043:50:00.000
end time: 3050:41:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, I think that's a great question. I think it would probably vary from school to school. I would probably say it's more immense specific to budget, maybe more so at the secondary level where they're engaging using for example, you know, ASB or student body can those particular types of things but that's something I can get more.

start time: 3050:42:10.000

confidence: 0.94
H: Thank you for the presentation. I had a question. Well, I think the college coordinator question was asked by Directors Sullivan and Brim Edwards. I was kind of confused about what I heard. I think it's been answered. Title one impact is also another question. But in terms of the minimum class sizes, which schools are going to be impacted? And maybe said another way, are schools that have low enrollment, Are those schools. I'm curious about those, particularly Jefferson, but there's other schools across our system that are under enrolled.

start time: 3062:29:40.000
end time: 3064:22:28.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Yeah. So. And that's a question Director Brim Edwards brought up as well. We'll have to go back.

start time: 3064:23:24.000
end time: 3065:49:20.000
confidence: 0.93
H: I'm concerned about like the, the, the schools that have higher student need.

start time: 3065:55:40.000
end time: 3066:03:16.000

E: Sure.

start time: 3066:04:28.000

start time: 3067:02:12.000
end time: 3067:36:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: In terms of the, the minimum class size.

start time: 3067:37:40.000
end time: 3067:48:04.000
confidence: 0.91
H: Yes. How.

start time: 3067:49:32.000
end time: 3068:03:32.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Being able.

start time: 3068:06:36.000
end time: 3073:29:18.000
confidence: 0.97
H: How that minimum. I thought it was an interesting way to report the data too, as a, as a minimum, not a maximum. Because we hear about maximum class size. But yeah, I'm just curious how that might play out. And which schools are going to be like feeling the most impacts. And are those schools that are feeling the most impacts closer to poverty?

start time: 3073:30:54.000
end time: 3083:45:22.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah, that's a good question. And so just so you know that our timeline is like we go through scheduling workshops with principals in April and so that's really where we're going to get a better idea in terms of, okay, what are the. What are we offering from a class size perspective or program perspective? And so it's hard for me to comment on that right now just based on the SMT release, but once we go through those particular pieces, we'll get a better idea of how many classes were we forced to collapse or not have based on that class size piece.

start time: 3083:47:46.000
end time: 3089:41:30.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Okay. And then would you circle back with the board on some response? The last question is, you said there's decisions that are made between an instructional coach, RESJ coordinator, restorative justice coordinator, rather climate specialist, or a social worker. Are those made at the building level by administrators?

start time: 3089:42:50.000
end time: 3089:47:06.000
confidence: 0.67
B: Yes.

start time: 3089:47:38.000
end time: 3089:59:10.000
confidence: 0.63
D: Okay.

start time: 3090:08:50.000
end time: 3095:46:24.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yes. So for example, for middle schools, for example, they were all given a 1.0 climate FTE which they could use for resj. It can be for an SMS. Those. That's the flexibility that they have there. But that's all entirely based on what the principal wants to do.

start time: 3095:49:12.000
end time: 3097:17:40.000
confidence: 0.94
H: Okay, are those, are those the way those allocated? Are they predictable by race.

start time: 3097:46:00.000
end time: 3098:28:00.000
confidence: 0.90
B: In terms of what a principal decides to do.

start time: 3098:28:40.000
end time: 3098:58:08.000
confidence: 0.97
H: With them at the building level?

start time: 3098:59:04.000
end time: 3099:15:44.000
confidence: 0.98
B: I'd have to.

start time: 3099:18:32.000
end time: 3099:36:48.000
confidence: 0.84
H: Can you circle back with that.

start time: 3099:37:44.000
end time: 3099:40:48.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Yes.

start time: 3099:41:04.000
end time: 3108:32:54.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I could circle back with that and know that. Because the SMT's just closed. Like we're analyzing the SMT. Sorry. It's called the Staffing Management Tool. It's where they, you know, they get their eye at their staffing and then they have to go through and decide how they're going to allocate their fte and then it closes. So then we kind of look at it and then we have scheduling workshops that come up as kind of another check and balance and supporting them on how to actually schedule with the staff that they have. So, yes, I can circle back.

start time: 3108:35:42.000

start time: 3110:30:38.000
end time: 3112:57:42.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yeah. So let me. So it's RESJ or RJ Coordinator, or it's a restore.

start time: 3112:58:46.000
end time: 3113:51:02.000
confidence: 0.94
H: I thought it was a Restorative Justice. Restorative justice, not a racial equity.

start time: 3113:52:06.000
end time: 3118:04:46.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Correct. Restorative justice coordinator. Getting my acronyms all mixed up. So it can be school social worker, Restorative justice coordinator, or an SMS position. It's like a school climate position. Like a student management.

start time: 3118:07:18.000
end time: 3120:32:30.000
confidence: 0.91
H: Yeah. It's listed as instructional coach, restorative justice coordinator, a climate specialist, or a social worker in your presentation.

start time: 3120:35:10.000
end time: 3120:52:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: That's correct.

start time: 3123:10:40.000
end time: 3169:36:58.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Thanks. So I have just a statement and then a couple questions. So having been through some of the. Absolutely. Way worse than this times at pps, I found that transparency is key to building trust and credibility in the district and a sense that we're all in it together. And that's especially true. Nobody's. Fewer people seem to care when we're adding to the budget because their piece of the pie isn't shrinking or it's not having an impact on their child, but intense interest of what's happening when cuts are being made that are going to directly impact students. So I'll just say it's disappointing we don't have a heat map tonight because I feel like we're talking about something we haven't even seen yet or we don't have any way of knowing. So, for example, I think Director Pass's question is great about, like, who is that impacting? I'm noticing that now on this slide, the district is promoting blended classrooms, which it hasn't done in the past because actually it said even though you just said good strategy, it wasn't a strategy the district supported. And now we're promoting them. And I'd like to have some transparency on where those are are. Because I can imagine where they are. I can imagine where they are. And our community should see what schools are going to get the blended classrooms and to understand since most schools don't have those currently, what sort of supports we're giving teachers to actually deliver to grade level curriculums. And it's a skill, but it hasn't been a practice at PPS. So what kind of supports? Because if we're getting $2.6 million from promoting blended classrooms, there must be a fair number of them. So I'd like to see that. I'd like to see how it all plays out because I think it also would answer this question because I still don't know what we're doing with career coordinators because right in the staffing manual it says we're not giving you an fte. But again, if we had what got sent out to schools or what we are saying is the staffing how it plays out, we'll be able to see that. We'll also, I think, be able to see where there's inequities perhaps geographically across the district. I also asked for the list of 37 FTEs that in slide 5 it says that we've added this back to schools. And it's like, that's great. I wonder where they got added back. Like, I'm in concerned about the Southeast Guidance coalition. Schools at 10 have been sent out. But the answer I got back is that we're not going to be able to give you a list of schools where those 37 were added back tonight.

start time: 3169:38:34.000
end time: 3170:06:34.000
confidence: 0.49
B: Tonight? Yeah, we'll give tonight.

start time: 3170:07:22.000
end time: 3219:21:04.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Okay. But people are being, are going to be undersigned, being laid off. I mean, and we're hearing from a lot of communities that are impacted. So the other thing this kind of fits in the transparency. I think we have to be really cautious when we're talking about flexibility for principals. Because what I've heard from the school community viewpoint is like there's actually really not flexibility. The district has made a decision based on resources which. And I'm not going to screen when your class size gets to a certain level, like 34 at fourth grade, we're not going to give you additional FTE like we used to. Your flexibility now is either have a high class size or do a blend. And I think there's a lot of portraying principal flexibility as this is a positive thing, when actually they're making some really hard choices. And I just think we have to be the central office the board needs to be honest about. Like it's not this great thing. They're getting flexibility. It's like you're getting fewer resources and you're going to have you know, you might have to cut something or take something else and that's your flexibility. So again, I think how we talk about it is really important. Same thing with the career coordinators. So there's going to be question at the end of this one. I stated earlier that I'm opposed to PPs breaking their promise that they made to the Southeast Guiding coalition schools, some that were really heavily impacted by boundary changes and also by program changes and closures. And so the district is proposing getting rid of that breaking their promise. What are the supports that are being given? And again, because we don't have a heat map, we don't know what it is, we don't know what the supports are. So for example, and I've shared this previous but because Lentz was made an all Spanish school and that's if you're in that neighborhood boundary and that's your neighborhood designated school and say you're in special ed, there's a number of students who are now going to Marys. But and so Marysville has had a disproportionate impact. And part of that FTE that we had that came about from that was to address situations like that or where you had. We changed a boundary but because we had a sibling legacy rule, it's a long trail. So they still have lower numbers. So I'm curious, like how we're gonna support those schools in some of the lowest socioeconomic neighborhoods and most diverse neighborhoods in Portland.

start time: 3219:21:52.000
end time: 3257:29:28.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, no, it's a great question. And I will say that regardless of not having that 10 FTE SEGC piece is that they're still a part of the problem process in regards to requesting FTE based on our limited set aside bucket. And so like for example, you know, we had our first round and mind you, there's a piece that we go through and there's going to be a few more iterations of this. So the first piece that we did recently was really about technical adjustment. So in other words, I mean you referenced the core program a lot. There's a. And I would say too with separate CGC schools, their pieces very specific around that money was really. Or that the FTE was a bridge. Right. So you don't have loss of program so that you don't lose those particular types of things. So those are what we would deem as technical because we don't want that to happen. And so know that that if they put in a request and it was technical by nature, meaning we made a mistake based on the allocation or it could mean a Loss of program. That those are requests that we'll look to honor. Right. And then we're also going to do another iteration come May and actually do a spring readjustment based on enrollment to kind of see where we are at. And so that could also mean, so you think about things that we do in the fall, we are going to apply those pieces earlier the spring. And so that could mean, right, that we move some things around even more there to accommodate, you know, where we see, you know, large influxes of enrollment, but then also to see, okay, so there's our projection off. Maybe we overestimated where you are and you're actually coming in a little bit lower enrolled. And that is in conjunction with what we're also going to be doing the fall. So. And know that all of our principals, they submit requests and we have to look at those specifically. And our first round was just based on technical adjustments. Are they able to meet core program? Are they able to do the things that the set aside bucket was used for?

end time: 3280:47:02.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Yeah. And I just wanted to jump in really quickly and say that. Just sort of a reminder that like we're, we're all on, we're all on the same team. We're all the district. So when we talk about, you know, promises made or the district, I mean, we've, we've redesigned our system to be more responsive based on the feedback that we heard from administrators. And so I think that there is some celebration in the fact that we're committed to being responsible, responsive. We're committed to listening, we're committed to putting every available resource back into schools. I mean, we have $40 million to reduce. I mean, that's a significant number. And you know, of course, any loss of any person, any position is significant. It's impactful, it's sad, it's disappointing. But to say that, you know, we're not standing on our promise. I mean, we, we're not able to, we don't, we don't have the funds nor the FTE or the, or the resources. And what the team and I set out to do is to be responsive to individual needs. And so I guess I'm sitting and wondering the question, are we responding to needs of buildings or are we responding to interests of the board?

E: Of meetings, but not sat in the Community conversations that we've been involved with over the last, what, eight to 12 weeks, we've sat with our. Our folks from a variety of positions to hear directly what they need from us to make this process work. And so I understand that there's process, there's things that predate me. There were commitments, there were promises. But I'm thinking about, like, this academic year, listening and hearing what's coming up for people and moves that we need to make to be more responsive. I think for me, my priority is to serve those who are in the building, who are, like, intimately involved with planning schedules, situating students in classrooms, interacting with communities, then commitments that were made a couple of years ago with a whole different budget and different resources that, frankly, we don't have available.

C: Well, I did ask. I just. I did ask Dr. Franco about, like, who. Just who decided, and it was like the larger principles. And it's like, okay, if you're not a principal of one of those schools, it is like that it would be a lower priority. And I don't think principals were like, we don't want to give it to the Southeast Guided coalition, But it wouldn't follow down the priority list if you're not one of those schools. But as I just say, we did make a promise. But this is also about why transparency is so important. Because when people can see it like, you made a technical fix, well, that would be good to know. But no, I'm just saying nobody knows. And so there's a lot of conversation in the community, is this, you know, is Southeast going to get stuck again, like we always do when people say.

E: That this has been the most transparent process that has happened in the last several years? And then I continue to hear, well, transparency matters. I mean, I think that's what we're moving to do. I mean, no, it's not perfect, and we're still building, and I think next year will be better in the year after and the year after. But hearing the early on feedback that people feel like we're moving the needle on transparency and communication, I think is something worth noting.

C: Just really quick to give my 20 years experience. I'm just saying the sooner we can get information out, the more it helps this school community process through it. Because it's not. The information's not out there. I mean, it's just so.

A: Thank you, Director Brimmer. Yeah. I mean, your point about transparency is good. And I hear you, too. I mean, I've seen great work in terms of transparency. It's been obvious. I just wanted to kind of add a little bit of perspective because I know this set aside SCGC FTE has, you know, been a hot topic. But I just, you know, this is my zone, I know it very well and one and your zone too, I know it very well. But just to add like a little bit of perspective, one of the, I'm sure that if you show all the parents this same choice, they would probably come to the same conclusion is that a lot of the 10 SCGC that were allocated to certain schools, they're also adjacent to very high need schools that were not part of the SCGC but are neighbors. And we're talking about, I mean, I know some schools in my neighborhood, you know, there's pockets of very high poverty. There's some schools that are reporting 30 plus, 30% plus special ed and they were not part of the SCGC process. And so when we, when we present this case being like, oh, do you want to keep your 10 SCGC positions? And in order to do so we have to take from, you know, this high sped school. I mean, I'm sure most parents would agree this is a choice between bad and worse. Right? And this is very difficult. So I think if we can show these, you know, like to your point, we show like, oh yeah, this is where the needs are, that would help a lot. But I just, I am saying that out loud. I have seen the needs and I've seen the choices and they're not good. And that's why like I'm not pushing for the 10 seg, but I do want, you know, some discussion around. But at the same time I understand why they have been allocated elsewhere because the needs, we need to respond to our students. And I think there's a lot of schools that were not part of the SCTC that have greater needs, unfortunately.

E: So, and that includes, if I just may add, that also includes schools that lost foundation funding. You know, I think there's this belief that because they're high SES that they don't have students and have a tremendous amount, amount of need. Obviously not like our designated schools, but they still have needs. They lost FTE as well. So creating some flexibility for them to be able to build in like maybe a reading interventionist to be able to interact with students because Maybe they lost 2.3 FTE from fundraising is the right thing for us to do on behalf of our kids. Right. Like our kiddos who impacted by multiple things going on in their life shouldn't only benefit from supports by going to a school that is a designated school. Right. And so, you know, and then the conversation about blends, we with our class sizes, we have some that are high average and then we have some that are really low. And so when we looked at blend, we weren't looking at okay, let's take those large class sizes and divide them out so that we don't add another. Let's look at where we're low. I mean we have a kindergarten class with seven students for next year so far last count. You know, that's not an anomaly. We have class sizes that are super low at some of those grade levels. And so blending them together so that we can save an FTE was also the right thing to do. And I take offense to the fact that, that there's an indication that that only happened in our communities of color. That's not what happened at all. And so we'll be prepared to show data on that. But I also would hope that the board is expecting that we're moving with intention, with our students and community in mind because any other implication that we're not doing that is just completely unjust, inappropriate and quite offensive.

C: Frankly. I didn't say that the students of colors were the lended classrooms. I said I would want to see the schools typically the lower enrolled schools that, that have like single strands that are being, they're generally being blended. And again, this is why having transparency to be able to, to see that. And I think that's what we owe it to our, to our school community and you all have visibility to things that we haven't seen seen. So it's hard for us to understand what the choices that are being made or the trade offs.

A: Thank you. I was hoping I had the last word, but I guess we'll move on. Thank you for all the information you provided that was really very helpful and all the passion that you see up here is because we care about our kids and our students. So thank you all. All right, we. The last thing on here, I did have a request from a couple board members to move their committee reports to the next meeting. I don't know. Director Prima, I didn't ask you yet. Okay, so we will, we'll follow up later. But so we don't have any of those unless there's other issues. Oh, Director Sullivan.
