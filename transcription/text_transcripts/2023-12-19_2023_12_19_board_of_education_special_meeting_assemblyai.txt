A: All right, we're ready. We're ready. Let's do it. All right. The special meeting of the Board of education for December 19, 2023 is called to order. All items being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the board and meeting tabs. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. All right, good evening and welcome, everyone. Tonight agenda we will have an update on the interim superintendent search, review the informal RFP process and discuss the proposed communication plan. We'll start off today and everybody should have gotten something from some. Everyone at least, you know, talking about this stuff. So. So you have two things in front of us. Yeah. So if you have any questions to those things, then let's go there versus going over the validity of the stuff. All right. We'll start out with Director Scott and Director Burme Edwards on the interim superintendent search.

start time: 20:38:10.000
end time: 53:26:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Thank you, Chair Hollins. I'll go ahead. Since Director Burme Edwards is virtual, I'll just give a quick verbal update on where we are and then she can fill in anything that I missed. But I think you also got an email to this effect as well. So the interim selection group, which is director remembers of me, we're working on the following. We are developing a basic scope of work for the interim superintendent, and that will be along the lines of basic superintendent responsibilities, which are defined in state law with really the goal of keeping things in the district moving forward over the next six months. We've been asking HR to do some market analysis to determine potential salary compensation ranges. We're getting prepared to do a rapid background check and also preparing to draft board resolution. And just as a reminder, the guiding criteria that the board discussed for an interim superintendent is as follows. We're looking for someone who is not a candidate for the current position, someone who has a track record as an effective district leader, also a track record of supporting equitable systems and practices. Ideally would have experience as a superintendent, would have Oregon school district experience as well and at a mid to large district or within a large system. And someone who understands that the job is to keep the district moving forward versus disrupting or making big changes or systemic changes. And then a big criteria is also availability, which I think is going to be a challenge over the next six months. So ideally, we're going to find a leader who meets most of this criteria and could step into the position as they know the job and have done similar work. I do want to note it may be possible that we'll have to consider things like housing costs if the potential interim does not currently live in the metro region. And we're looking for someone over the next six months. But just to put that out on the table, and then I'll just note that recruitment is underway and we will update the board once we are able to identify potential candidates who meet those criteria.

C: No, you covered it well. I just say that we're. We're acting with urgency, knowing that we have a relatively short time frame and also the winter break in front of us.

confidence: 0.92
A: Okay. I didn't know if Director Green was on or not. I thought I seen something from him, but. All right, Any other questions or comments? Oh, he's not on it. Okay. Any other questions or comments around the superintendent search? I just wondered your mic.

start time: 65:48:50.000
end time: 67:49:50.000

start time: 68:02:10.000
end time: 74:17:24.000
confidence: 0.96
B: We've had some preliminary conversations, but again, it's a challenge to find folks who are both available and sort of meeting those criteria. So really trying to work through pretty quickly. As Director Brim Edwards said, you know, given where we are the week before Christmas, the holidays and New Year's, it's a little bit of a challenging time, but we are doing some outreach at this point.

confidence: 0.94
A: Okay. So I had some concerns, but I worry about that once we find somebody and then we can talk about that stuff. All right, next we have Director DePass and Director Sullivan on the informal RFP process.

start time: 80:38:50.000
end time: 84:24:18.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Okay, before we start on that, I would like to say thank you to Director depas, who's done almost all the work and has really helped me learn about this. So anyway, it's been fun to work with you. Thank you for all your knowledge.

start time: 84:27:14.000
end time: 121:46:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Thank you. We got right on it late last week and drafted, I guess, Friday and into the weekend, a boilerplate template that was shared with us for a different search, but we modified the language. I know Director Brim Edwards shared some comments and edits, and I kind of took the liberty of editing some of your edits, not substantially, but around the point value for the criteria. And also because I think, you know, one of the things I value, and I think as a board we value is the inclusion of minority owned and women owned businesses. And for search firms there, there are very few, if Not. I mean I know of one search firm that is a woman owned minority woman owned search firm and they are not local. And so I edited the language around having local expertise to saying to prioritize someone that could partner with someone regionally or locally that understands the K12 landscape but still allows us to potentially contract with a bipoc woman owned firm who has. It would be an opportunity for us as a district to spend a few dollars in that community. I don't know if anybody's had a chance to read it, but we. There are some written criteria, qualifications. The maximum points available are 20 experience and approach to the work. We're awarding 30 because they'll have to talk about a timeline, provide information about other searches and demonstrated their expertise in other searches. And then for past performance and price proposal we've awarded there's a maximum of 25 points each. But so it's the maximum points being experience approach is kind of our highest priority. And then it goes to cost past performance and the qualifications overall. And I think we removed the background checks from this RFP because we had talked about outsourcing that to a third party.

start time: 122:35:10.000
end time: 123:27:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: All right, any comments, questions around this?

start time: 123:37:50.000
end time: 129:40:48.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I have one very small comment, but around the scope of work. We asked for experience firms with a history of conducting successful searches for large urban school districts with 20,000 to 70,000 students. And I just wonder if we need that specificity. I would just hate if someone had done a search for an 80,000 student district and somehow got graded down. Can we just say searches for larger urban school districts and leave it open at that point?

start time: 129:41:44.000
end time: 130:23:00.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Absolutely. And I appreciate that feedback. Yes.

start time: 131:02:00.000
end time: 135:33:00.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So one comment on that. Instead of larger urban districts because I think actually PPS is on the low end of what would be considered a larger urban district. I would say a mid. Mid to large size urban district.

start time: 136:06:00.000
end time: 139:51:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I was wondering if there was language around, you know, like industry standard, what a small district is, what a mid size, what a larger. I mean I think LA Unified has 600,000 students, so they're probably a larger urban district.

start time: 139:56:50.000
end time: 145:06:18.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Right. If you look at Council of Great City Schools, we're kind of on the low. We're on the lower end of the. What would be considered an urban larger urban district. So I just, I guess as long as we include mid to larger, I think we capture.

start time: 145:09:14.000
end time: 145:24:30.000
confidence: 0.74
E: Okay.

start time: 146:43:30.000
end time: 147:47:30.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Chair Holmes, can I make both a comment and a question?

start time: 147:55:10.000
end time: 148:09:30.000
confidence: 0.58
A: Yeah.

start time: 148:19:10.000
end time: 181:01:40.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So a comment. Director dupass, I wanted to sort of acknowledge your comment at the beginning about a local partner. My understanding is most of the search firms who do Superintendent searches are not locally based, so they're all national or sort of in some other region. And that this, the assumption by using the term local, it wasn't to exclude any firms that the assumption is that. My assumption was that most in any firm that's going to be doing this work would probably most likely partner with somebody that's either local or regional. They usually have somebody that they bring on as a consultant. So that wasn't meant to be exclusionary. It was just the assumption that they, they would, would have that. I am curious about the cost, the change in the points and I'm trying to pull up the document from my perspective, the value that having been through some of these searches, I would hope we'd have a weighting on a higher rating on past performance because that, you know, our, the most critical thing is that we, we get a re. We get the results that we, we want, which is the recruitment and hiring of a, of a superintendent. And I would hope that among our weighting that, that would be weighted disproportionately more than say not, you know, cost obviously is a factor, but that we sort of put a premium on getting results and having had a track record of successful searches.

start time: 181:28:40.000
end time: 198:16:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, I understand that. I think, I think, I mean as a board, we hadn't really talked about what our ranking system is or how we would express our values here. And so I made my best guess at those past performance and price proposals being equal. If we say past performance, sometimes that would tend to preference firms that have been doing it for a long time, producing maybe predictable results versus allowing for low barrier entry to firms that might not have been around for 40 years that are emerging to offer them a chance at. They would still have to prove that they had performed. All of the firms will have, but it allows for newer entrants into this search industry. That was the reasoning behind my wanting to give equal points to each of those categories. But I'm open. It doesn't have to be just me.

start time: 199:57:50.000
end time: 200:29:58.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Yeah, I just have a really quick question too.

start time: 200:30:54.000
end time: 201:16:50.000
confidence: 0.84
A: Oh yeah, I was about to call on. All right, go ahead.

start time: 201:31:10.000
end time: 210:23:30.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Yeah, thank you. Director DePast and Sullivan. I think I really, I really like the priorities that are listed in the document. I think they're really good. I guess I just have one question about why having a point system, just because, you know, I figure with, you know, every individual has different strengths and weaknesses, we may want to weight it differently. So I'm just kind of curious what the reasons behind having a point system in the first place are. Yeah, just want to be educated. Thanks.

start time: 210:38:30.000
end time: 227:59:50.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I'll answer that just the best way I know. And that's that for public procurement and public agencies that have an obligation to spend a portion of their dollars, the publicly public dollars, in communities of color and women owned industries and service disabled veterans, one of the, the points count as a way of ranking your value system. So if you really want, let's say you really want a woman owned firm with, you know, 10 years of experience, you can weight the point structure to indicate what it is to any firms that propose what your values are and how they can speak to those values. But I don't think there's any hard and fast rules. I think the points indicate it's like a grading scale. If you know your professor tells you you're going to get an A if you include these five elements, then you want to include those five elements. If you care about the A and it's just a way of indicating what's important to us as a public agency.

start time: 228:50:40.000
end time: 228:56:40.000
confidence: 0.83
A: Great.

start time: 228:57:20.000
end time: 229:19:40.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Thank you. That makes sense.

start time: 229:29:20.000
end time: 232:51:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: All right, any other questions, comments, thoughts? So it seems like, you know, everybody's okay with the point system as it is, so. All right, Any other questions? Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

start time: 233:12:00.000
end time: 238:19:46.000
confidence: 0.96
D: It seemed like when we talked last time we'd set kind of a limit of what we'd spend, not necessarily how one firm might be more than the other. So is that maybe more appropriate to say?

start time: 238:20:58.000
end time: 250:06:30.000
confidence: 0.96
E: I mean, we talked about it amongst ourselves and in some RFPs there is a understanding that it doesn't go above 200,000 or whatever the dollar figure is. But this one they're going to be doing, they're going to be experienced search firms that are going to have give us a cost proposal and I would expect that they would be pretty close. They're all going to have similar elements and it will just be up to us to determine if there's a widespread how we handle it at the time. I mean, if you get one bid that's 50,001 that's 200,000, you have to wonder what, you have to ask some questions about what's being included and what's excluded and what the proposers understood.

start time: 250:48:10.000
end time: 257:07:50.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Really quickly. One problem with including a cap is that sometimes it's also a price signal to the folks who are coming in to say, oh, if we're saying we're not going to spend more than 75 or more than 100, then they say, oh, well, that's what they budgeted. So that's what I'll propose at. So sometimes we Want to sort of leave it open to say, hey, if you think it's going to cost 125, then tell us that. But if you think you can do it for 75, tell us. Tell us that. So.

start time: 257:08:30.000
end time: 258:26:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Okay, we can have in our own mind what we have. Okay, thank you.

start time: 258:35:10.000
end time: 261:11:34.000
confidence: 0.93
A: All right. Any other questions regarding the rfp? Awesome. Awesome. All right, so the next thing I.

start time: 261:11:42.000
end time: 283:54:20.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Just, I just want to note that if the rest of the board is okay with that, I'm not. Just want to note that I'm not comfortable with the heavier weight on the price versus past performance just because you generally get, you know, one shot on these. And so I would, my preference would be to know that we have a firm with a strong track record of. And they're going to have to describe it, but have a strong track record and that be of recruiting and delivering a pool of qualified candidates that end up being hired. And so for me, that would be just a higher premium than somebody being. I don't know how we're going to score the points, but because the price is what it, what it is and, and we can, we can value that if somebody's proposal is too high. But I think we should, from my experience, put a premium on track record of delivering a successful search and with, as noted in the proposal, with a diverse pool of candidates. So I just want to note that.

start time: 284:06:00.000
end time: 285:42:24.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Gotcha. Gotcha. Noted. All right, any other questions, comments, concerns, thoughts?

start time: 285:43:12.000
end time: 304:56:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I also have a question just about our approach in terms of. In the. Initially we talked about asking three, three firms to apply and I know there's a longer list and I'm curious about how we're going to decide how it's going to be open and if we're going to have basically allow, not, not have requests for proposals, but instead have it be, you know, widely distributed and how we narrow it down. Say if we had a lot of responses and whether we wanted to have some sort of mechanism that if we had a high number of responses that then we narrowed it down to three and had some sort of mechanism deciding among the three versus like a much larger group. So I'm curious about the, the process which we would use to decide who we're going to ask to submit proposals and then how we're going to narrow it down from there.

start time: 305:09:30.000
end time: 312:30:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yes. So the goal is, you know, by the, they have their RFPs in by the 9th. That give us about a week, I believe we have until we select, you know, the group. And I'm, I'm assuming we'll go with the ones who have some of the highest scores. And then those would be the ones that we can look at to invite to, you know, to come and present.

start time: 313:00:30.000
end time: 330:56:40.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I want to speak to that, too. So, you know, I've worked in public procurement before, and I know that it's really important to be intentional about who you reach out to. And a couple days ago, I shared with the board a list, a small list of searches that came up on a. In response to a question from school board partners asking specifically about superintendent searches. And so the same, you know, Universe of about 6 search firms came up. And then I was asked to add a couple of other firms that weren't on that list. And so I think that might be the universe of superintendent search firms. I think it's about. I don't have it in front of me, but I think it was maybe about eight firms altogether. So are you concerned that we would be getting 30 proposals or. I want to make sure we're inclusive of. There's only a single, I think women owned business. And I'd like to make sure that we at least capture that. But. And so my thought was to open it up so we're not excluding any firm.

start time: 331:23:40.000
end time: 345:37:00.000
confidence: 0.95
C: My question was what the process was. So are we sending it to that list of firms with a group quest, and that's the universe or it. If somebody said, I saw that you are doing a recruitment and they're not on the list, that they're going to be included, or are we going to use that list? I'm trying to just understand the process. And then the other thing, Director Hollins, or, I'm sorry, Chair Hollins, the proposal current, that informal RFP doesn't have an interview process. It just has a scoring. So what's, what's contemplated in the document is not interviewing the top firms, which is why I asked that question.

start time: 346:18:00.000
end time: 348:30:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Okay, so let me. Let me address one thing. The paper says the 24th is supposed to be the ninth.

start time: 348:38:30.000
end time: 350:30:54.000
confidence: 0.92
E: That's correct. Yeah, that's correct. I think when we first talked, though, we would talk about getting the. Getting them in on the 22nd.

start time: 350:32:22.000
end time: 350:41:18.000
confidence: 0.83
A: Yeah.

start time: 350:42:54.000
end time: 352:03:58.000
confidence: 0.97
E: And then I looked at the date and I was like, well, let's move it out a couple days. But it's the ninth.

start time: 352:05:34.000
end time: 352:14:54.000
confidence: 0.72
A: Yes.

start time: 352:17:02.000
end time: 359:09:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: So that this is going to go out as soon as we approve it. And does that give us enough time to get good proposals? I mean, I know a lot of the proposals, the proposers probably will have boilerplate language. They'll have proposal templates ready to go, but there's going to be Some customization needed in between the first, which is New Year's, and the ninth, when this is due. I don't think it's enough time.

start time: 359:21:20.000
end time: 365:53:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Well, I think it should be. And the reason why I say that is because I talked with some folks who have done recruitments for looking at firms and stuff, and they thought it was adequate because I thought so too at first. That's why I said the 22nd. But I know I had a phone call with a few folks who have done this multiple times, and they were like, yeah, that should be enough time. So that just. That's just my point of view on that.

start time: 365:55:40.000
end time: 366:51:00.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Yeah. Didn't they say at purchasing they thought that would be enough?

start time: 366:53:00.000
end time: 367:47:16.000
confidence: 0.99
E: I think when we asked them, I think they said that would be enough time, too.

start time: 367:48:28.000
end time: 368:16:52.000
confidence: 0.81
A: Okay. So we can just. We can go with the 96.

start time: 368:17:16.000
end time: 368:47:16.000
confidence: 0.76
E: So we'll make sure everybody okay with that.

start time: 368:49:48.000
end time: 371:11:00.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Okay. And then also, as far as the process of interviewing candidates, do that need to be in the RFP of interviewing candidates?

start time: 371:20:40.000
end time: 379:34:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: It's a good question. And actually, I don't know if staff's available to answer or not to Director Bermedwards point. I think it's my experience is that the RFPs, usually you have the option of pulling people in for an interview, but it's not required if we don't need to. If there's a clear favorite or we want to make a decision. So I would agree that making sure we have that option if we want to exercise it, but not making it a requirement. Requirement. And so I don't know, reading through the proposal, evaluation award, it's not mentioned. I don't know if that prohibits us from doing that or not.

start time: 379:51:10.000
end time: 381:52:06.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I would think that they might want to if. If we do have an optional interview, we might want to add that into this rfp.

start time: 381:53:58.000
end time: 382:00:22.000

A: Yeah.

start time: 382:01:26.000
end time: 382:50:46.000
confidence: 0.99

start time: 382:51:58.000
end time: 389:24:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah. And I know from. At least from the conversations I had, a lot of search firms. Search firms know that interviews happen. So I don't know if it's. They said we need to have it in here or not, but it would probably be safe to have it in here. Like Director Scott was saying, have it in here, and then we can determine if it could be optional for them or not.

start time: 389:31:40.000
end time: 390:12:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Sounds like the board wants to make sure we have the option.

start time: 390:26:20.000
end time: 393:20:22.000
confidence: 0.98
E: There may be an interview. So should we add some language to this that says, like, as a line item on a budget or so, just what it's worth.

start time: 393:21:26.000
end time: 398:30:30.000
confidence: 0.99
C: I did ask this question and it was taken out, but it can Be added back in at the Tier 2 second stage. But it's not. It's not currently in. But we can add it back in.

start time: 398:31:10.000
end time: 399:35:10.000

B: Sorry, directors, What Tier two second stage? I wasn't sure that was referring to.

start time: 399:44:10.000
end time: 402:58:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: It's. That's where it was in the proposal. After the. They're ranked. And then you. You'd add it back in with evaluation criteria.

start time: 403:04:10.000
end time: 404:09:50.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So in section 4, proposal, evaluation, award, adding the language back in there.

start time: 405:26:50.000
end time: 407:08:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I guess he's asking is, do you want to. Is that where we put that at under proposal, evaluation and awards?

start time: 407:35:00.000
end time: 407:59:56.000
confidence: 1.00
C: I don't have it in front of me.

start time: 408:01:08.000
end time: 408:12:28.000
confidence: 0.85
E: I believe there was.

start time: 408:13:24.000
end time: 409:30:00.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Assuming we can get the staff direction to add it back in at the appropriate place.

start time: 410:00:20.000
end time: 410:23:20.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Yeah, that sounds good.

start time: 410:28:20.000
end time: 414:44:02.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, that's great. There was a table just under the table that talks about experience and past performance. In the price proposal, there was another. The boilerplate that we were working with was for two different searches, so we had to do some cleanup.

start time: 414:46:26.000
end time: 424:28:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Okay. So it sounds like we just direct staff to add that back in. Change the date to the 9th. And then for us, from the 9th, we have. We should be able to have seven days, which gets us to the 16th, which we have another special session. And we can kind of just cumulate, you know, the highest ones based on everyone individual assessments are scoring. And then by the 16th, we should be able to narrow it down to the top three. That sound like a plan for everyone?

start time: 424:51:50.000
end time: 428:31:20.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Just a query, just to make sure that we're on the same page. So there was a list of firms that were circulated, and then there were additions that were added. That's who we're sending it out to. And that's the universe.

start time: 428:32:40.000
end time: 435:18:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Juliet, I want to get the process done first because you're going to another section. So the process far as from getting on the 9th and then us individually scoring them. And so by the 16th, we should be able to narrow down to the final three. I just want to make sure everybody is clear on that process. Any objections?

start time: 435:37:30.000
end time: 436:04:02.000
confidence: 0.77
F: Okay, from here.

start time: 436:05:46.000
end time: 436:59:10.000
confidence: 0.99
A: All right, so now we can go ahead. Now you can go ahead and ask your question.

start time: 437:09:30.000
end time: 442:35:02.000
confidence: 0.94
C: So it's back to the start of the process. This is going to be. We're going to use the list that Director DePass circulated along with the ads that were made. And that's the universe of the firms. The question is that that's the universe of the firms we're sending it to. It's not an open rfp. It's the firms that were listed.

start time: 442:37:06.000
end time: 445:36:46.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I think it is an open RFB because I think all RFPs have to be open. I think we send it to certain people because it's underneath the limit, but anyone. But then we post it publicly and anyone can respond.

start time: 445:39:58.000
end time: 449:53:02.000
confidence: 0.96
E: There were. I just found the list. There are nine. There's a kind of a superintendent search directory, which isn't a firm necessarily, but above that, there are nine firms listed. I'm happy to resend that list again if it would be helpful.

start time: 449:55:26.000
end time: 452:15:02.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So. So are you asking is this going to just be open to any firm or just the ones that we have on that list? And so I think the answer is.

start time: 452:15:26.000
end time: 452:36:54.000
confidence: 0.86
C: I was trying to just get clarity.

start time: 452:37:42.000
end time: 453:34:50.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yeah, it's going to be open to. It's going to be open to all firms.

start time: 454:37:50.000
end time: 457:03:02.000
confidence: 0.95
C: And we'll specifically send it to the list that has been been circulated to board members.

start time: 457:06:06.000
end time: 531:58:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Correct. And they think about it. You know, search firms know when a school district is looking for a new soup and going through this search. So I'm sure we're going to get a, you know, a variety of search firms. You know, it's a small industry and word gets around quick. I've already been approached by like five already. So it's out there. So I'm going to assume that we're going to get a lot of interest, but it will go out to everyone. Any other comments, questions, thoughts? All right, so you got what we're going to do as far as changing the dates, and I can follow up right now. Okay. Okay. Next we have the superintendent search communication plan. So me, Director Green, Director Eddy, and even though Frankie had just emailed me, she's going to be on this as well, and she's going to work with us with the DCU group to hit to make sure that we are including our students as well. So just kind of a basic plan. It's an ongoing plan, so it's not static. It can move, it can evolve, it can pivot, it can change. But this is just kind of an outline of the process that we can use to make sure that we are getting a message out to our community and our staff and everyone. So kind of the key messages is about making sure that we are transparent, make sure we have community involvement throughout this process, making sure we have a clear timeline and making sure we have things accessible for our community. So we got a couple, a few items that we set up. So for instance, communication channels, website. My understanding that we. That is set up and on our PPS board page, website already and by phone, as you can see, people calling using social media. And when I Mean social media. I'm talking about PPS platforms, whether it's a pps, Facebook, Twitter page, what have you, email updates, sending them to parents, teachers, principals, school staff, including links to events that we might have as we going through this process, community meetings. And a lot of this stuff will be co designed with our search consultant firm that we hire. But I want to make sure that we have a direct direction that we give our search firms to say this is what we would like to do once we have selected the search firms, of course, the press releases, newsletters, flyers and posters. I'm not really into the flyers and posters. It was just a suggestion that can go if it's okay, I'm okay with that. Community engagement events. And again this, again this is another one that will be design with our search consultants getting community input when we have informs or we got things that meet the candidates, you know, however that process is going to go focus groups, especially with our diverse stakeholders. If we're going to do stuff like online surveys, email feedback and then we have our let's talk piece. So if we can create some something for our less talk that specifically talks to the superintendent search piece and then just kind of evaluate on a regular basis how effective we are being and making sure that if we need adjustments we have the space and time to do that. So any questions, thoughts?

start time: 532:24:00.000
end time: 534:16:08.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Well, it's a lot and I guess how we're going to do it, who's going to do it, something we have to work out.

start time: 534:18:24.000
end time: 541:35:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah. And a lot of this stuff will help with hopefully our search firm kind of can help us out with this stuff too. But we already have like our Facebook page main our website that like the updates for like this meeting will go on there, the video of this meeting will go on there. So we just start trying to look at picking those things out. Frankie, I mean, sorry, Director Silverstein.

G: Hi. Thank you. Sorry, I'm a little sick so I sound funny. But I think I just wanted to mention first of all, I really like the plan and this is making me really optimistic for how this search is going to go. Showing the commitment to engaging in community. I think in terms of press releases, it'd be really great if those press releases can get sent to like the high school publications as well because I think that's a pretty direct link for informing students. And then I think also like you mentioned, I can really help with like looping in the district student council. I know that we have our own Instagram. So like I saw on the list like talking about some like live Q&As on social media and stuff. So if we're looking to do some student focused stuff, I think the DSE will be a great opportunity. And then also the district council is working on creating our own newsletter for students. Like an overall kind of one. And so we were talking about having a section that would be like an update section about the superintendent search. So I just wanted to let you all know that.

start time: 559:05:20.000
end time: 564:11:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Awesome. Awesome. I'm looking forward to working with you on that. I think it's real important that you know, during this process that we really take in count of our students voices. So I'm looking forward to it. Director Brim Edwards.

start time: 565:10:50.000
end time: 598:51:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah, thanks to this team. Excellent work. Just like the last work group. The one issue that I just want to raised from a capacity standpoint is from our comms team is that there's always the question of how much the search firm is going to do and how much our internal staff is going to do and like what and what their capacity is. Just given we have all our, all of our normal, you know, ongoing school based and district based comms work that's being done. I know from just past searches it's a significant, significant additional work stream. So I just want to flag that if we, when we talk about it like understanding who, the expectation of who is going to do that work. So for example, the community engagement say around the position description, if we wanted to have a series of focus groups or stakeholder groups around the position, developing the refresh new position description, just knowing is that going to be done by the search firm in conjunction with the board or is it going to be the district comms team and just making sure we have the capacity for that. So I just want to flag that so we have understanding who's going to. It's because I know there's a high degree of interest and a significant amount of interest by our community. So being able to push out communications proactively is a fair amount of work during the, during the search process overlaid with the budget process and everything else that's happening in the district. So just flag that how we're, you know, the conversation with the comms team about how they might handle that in conjunction with the search firm.

start time: 598:54:20.000
end time: 613:12:20.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Oh yeah, absolutely. And one of the things came out of that conversation that I had this past week is that the search firm, a lot of the search firms have those type of communication plans and abilities to hold some of those events as well working with the board. So going to your what you're saying versus the search Firm versus our comms. And so that's part of the stuff that we will be looking for when we are evaluating the search firms is their ability to be able to do that type of work as well. Like I said from the conversations, the search firms should have a plan for that as well. So definitely make sure that we are keeping note of that during this process. For to start firms.

start time: 613:51:20.000
end time: 625:52:20.000
confidence: 0.96
B: The only thing I would note is the need to keep moving forward while we're in that RFP process. I mean, if we're not optimistically, we'll get a search for MOM by the end of January. But it would be nice to continue over this next month to be doing work on the, you know, for instance, the position description. And I'm even thinking about, you know, we want to engage our community. I think I've heard from the board around that position description and I just worry if we wait, a good executive search is going to take three to four months and, you know, really at minimum. And so it would be good that the firm that comes in can hit the ground running with a, you know, job description that has already, you know, been vetted. It's already been, you know, through the process. Maybe they just sort of pick it up and carry it across the finish line. But I just, I don't want to start that process in late January because I think that puts us, you know, behind.

start time: 625:54:20.000
end time: 629:12:56.000
confidence: 0.95
E: So I mean, they've probably done candidate profiles. They probably have a menu of options for us to look through. Or rather than starting from scratch.

start time: 629:14:48.000
end time: 631:36:08.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Yeah, I'm using. It'd be nice for us if, you know, if we have a position description that, you know, the board, the community, other stakeholders have weighed in on that we can hand them. It speeds up the process.

start time: 631:38:24.000
end time: 631:53:40.000
confidence: 0.98
E: Thank you.

start time: 632:00:00.000
end time: 654:26:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah, I think from the 2017 search we have, there was very extensive engagement with the community, whether it was stakeholder groups, papsa, our labor partners, students, community based groups. So we have that list. So we could use that as sort of the starting point and use. We could look at the last position description as needing a sort of refresh. But I think to Director Scott's point of sort of pulling that out and then creating a list, circulating it among the board of who needs to be added. And then there is sort of a process that we used in 2017 to, to get feedback. And it actually was fairly remarkable. I felt like with the diverse group of stakeholders that we. We had, that there was in that context in 2017, a real consensus around the type of leader we wanted. So we can basically use that as a. Use that as a foundation and just the stakeholders we engaged and make sure that we have everyone we want to have included. But we don't have to start from scratch.

start time: 655:05:10.000
end time: 683:48:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah, I was looking at the calendar and I'm thinking if we start that process right after the first of the year, so say that the week of the 8th or the week of the 7th, I mean, start that process then. So I like the idea of looking at the job description that we have now, looking at some of the characteristics that we want now can get circulated now, and then by that end of the week of the 7th, which is the 12th, we can start having some ideas of, as a board, what we want, what we're looking for, and then start a plan of how do we engage the community and looking for what their wants are, what their qualification, what their characteristics that they want as well. So if we can get a copy of the current job description, some of the stuff that Director Bermet was talking about in 2017, we can disseminate that to our board. So between now and the 8th of January, we can start making comments, thoughts and stuff, and then that week we can come up with a plan on how to engage the community in that process as well. All right, any other questions, comments, thoughts around the communication plan? All right. All right. Well, no other business meeting is. Oh, go ahead.

confidence: 0.98
D: When I read this earlier, talks a lot about updates and just a real certain place where people in the community can send their questions and maybe a timeline of when we answer them. So people know if their questions come in, they're going to be answered. Because I think sometimes there's a lot out there, but it doesn't really get coordinated.

start time: 692:14:20.000
end time: 698:25:40.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Yeah. So they have questions. We have one thing, we have a way of that those questions will come to us, especially since it's about the superintendent's transition plan. So they can go to. Let's talk and then we can respond as we get those as well. Dr. Bermet was. You had a hand up.

start time: 698:27:40.000
end time: 714:23:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah, I was just going to say on that point, as things come in, in the communication plan, there is a bi weekly updated at our either board, board meetings or the work sessions. And I know that what we've done in the past is as questions come in, there's a fair amount of overlap across, across the questions. And so we can use the opportunity, when we're communicating out to look at the trends among the types of questions we're getting and use our. The various channels of communication that have been outlined in the communication plans to answer those questions again, either at board meetings or just in, like updates on the website, because they do generally just run in batches or there's trends of the types of questions people ask. And so we can continue to point them back to different places where to find that information and then proactively push it out.
