A: Good evening, everyone. Good evening. Good evening, Good evening. Thank you all for being here this evening. This public special meeting of the Board of education for April 24, 2024 is now being called to order. All items being considered in this evening have been posted on the PPS website under the Board meetings tabs. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. So please check the district website for replay times. Again, I want to say good evening everyone and thank you all for being here this evening. We've got a large crowd outside as well as we've got people on the inside. And so for safety purposes, we've set up that viewing area and we'll be closing the doors once the boardroom is fully filled and that all the seats have been taken just for the sake of safety. Now, before we get started, I want to share a few reminders. In order to ensure public safety, please keep the walkways and the aisles clear. We also ask you to please be considerate to those around you and to keep any signs below chin level. We also ask that you do not hang or attach signs, banners or posters to any objects in the room or on any walls. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that our primary objective is to engage the Board's business and to receive the proposed budget for the next year. And if we cannot conduct our business in this room, we will move our meeting to another location. This action is detrimental, would have a detrimental effect on those who came here with the intention of participating in this public forum. And with that, the next thing that we're going to have is a vote on the consent agenda. Now, before I vote, move that. Since I got the microphone, I've been wanting to do this anyway. I'm just going to take one minute to my board colleagues and say, in the last meeting, I allowed my emotions to get high and I got louder than what I normally should have. I make a habit of watching the tapes. And after I went back and watched the tapes, I could actually see there was a point in the meeting where I went from talking about what I was talking about to I was talking about it, but frustration had kicked in. And at that point, that's when I noticed the change in me. It's not about what other people do, it's about how I respond. And I responded the wrong way. And so because I did that in the public, then the apology has to come to the public, and not just in a back room to a few people. So while I'M here. I want to take this moment and to apologize to the community, to those of you here, for all the people in the room that were there, for all the people that may have watched it online. Because the way I do things or how I do things matters. It's not simply what I say, but how I say it also that matters. Whether we agree or disagree is irrelevant. But how I. How I come, how I present myself to the staff, to the community, that's important to me. And I feel like I have to do better. So for that, again, I apologize and I hope that you can forgive me. And again, I'm not asking you to agree with me, but I'm hoping that we can continue to disagree in a way that does not disrespect, belittle, or demean anyone in the space, because no one deserves that. Is that okay? All right.

Let's legally Kara's okay. And my legal team is giving me a thumbs up so I'm not going to jail behind this. And it was approved by a vote of, let's see, six to zero, with Student Director Silverstein unofficially voting yes. Excellent. Now we're going to move on to learning more about the proposed budget for the 2425 school year. This is the first time that we're learning about the budget. And Interim Superintendent Hux, would you now like to introduce this topic?

C: Thank you, Vice Chair Green. And to the board tonight, I want to say a few words with you about the proposed budget for 2425 school year. This budget is reflects a lot of very difficult decisions that were made in a multi year problem that we have with revenue and expenditures not aligning. Unfortunately, we're in a position of having to close a $30 million gap between funding and we need to look at current service levels and the rising cost, lower enrollment and the end of one time federal funds. No one wants to make these tough decisions, but these tough decisions must be made. I also want to acknowledge that we know it's been a very disruptive year and that it's challenging during that much change to also communicate as many times as we want to about our heartfelt sorrow about the real impacts. Getting quite a bit of feedback up here. The sorrow that we have about the real impacts that will be felt everywhere. We will be reducing some services to students. It will be felt by many, and we are cutting some positions across the district. I want to be really clear that I'm not trying to say that this is a positive situation, this is not a good situation, but we must get through it. And I would encourage us to get through it with the best style of civility, passion, advocacy and leadership that we possibly can. So Deputy Superintendent Myung Lee, who's been absolutely fantastic, has done a lot of the heavy lifting with his wonderful team on the numbers in the budget. But the whole cabinet and voices of principals, we could have used more voices of principals have been engaged in helping us get to this place. Myung Lee is here for questions when we get to that section. I also want to acknowledge the amazing executive leadership and the other finance team members that are here. If there's a question that Myung Lee and I cannot answer and you have a question of one of them, bring them to the table so that they can respond. So this is the proposed 202425 budget, and I want to start with a few observations that I made the last time that I spoke at a board meeting as an interim superintendent. I've known of Portland Public from afar. I was in Salem Kaiser for eight years. So from 2006 on, I've been medium aware of what's going on in Portland Public. I didn't realize until I came here in the interim role some things that I'd been missing. This is a remarkable district. It's got some amazing services. The board and the district and the community have been able to maintain commitment to a robust curriculum and many, many program offerings for students. Arts, culture, music, dual language, athletics, Advanced Placement, ib, Career tech. The list goes on and on. The district also has weathered historic challenges over the years and demonstrated its resilience. It's going to take that to get through this going forward. So how do we move forward? We need to build on the strengths in the community. I'm hoping that we as a community can unite in a vision for the school district while we lean in on solving problems and think about how we achieve that vision together. I'm also going to continue mentioning the unity or the uniting across the Portland public community. We are an important voice in Salem and when we approach our legislature, I believe we need to be thoughtful about what other community groups, parents, business leaders, faith based leaders, other school district leaders, school board leaders can help us as we think about how we move forward. So two of our guiding principles that we are trying to minimize impact to students. I want to emphasize the try because I know this is going to have an impact on students and an impact on educators. We also want to continue the initiatives that support student achievement that lead to the great graduation rates that we have in this school district. I'll talk a little bit more about some of those student achievement initiatives, but I'm very pleased and proud of what the instruction team has been working on, what the principals and teachers have been implementing. So I'll come back to that in a few those were our guiding principles in terms of budget context. We're facing several different financial pressures right now that are coming together all at the same time. We have inflation around cost of goods and services. We've also because we truly know that a great school district begins with great employees, we've leaned in and agreed on investing in compensation and benefits, teacher planning time so that we can support our employees. Those are good things that I feel good about. We did receive federal funding for students needs during the pandemic. Those needs aren't gone even though the federal funding is leaving. The student needs continue. We've made some gains in academic achievement of time we lost during the pandemic. Not enough. But Portland and a couple of other districts are pointed to as a positive example of where some academic gains have begun. We have a long way more to go and we also know students have way more needs outside of Academic gains, social, emotional, mental health, the ability to compete in music, athletics, et cetera. Our state dollars continue to fall short of the cost it takes to operate our schools. In addition to the federal pandemic aid ending, we also have some special revenues that come to us from some other federal sources that are declining. Another significant impact in Portland and other districts, but it's having quite a bit of impact on us is the declining enrollment. We would be facing reductions even if we had adequate state dollars because of the declining student enrollment. And that trend, just based on what we can see now, is not predicted to change. Now. There could be some things that happen. We could have new industry come in. You know, something could change. But even if the birth rate started changing immediately, we're still five to six to seven to eight years out from seeing that kind of a positive impact. So I think we have to be prepared that the student enrollment decline is a reality that we need to face at this point in time. Just to share a little bit more about the enrollment trends, many of you know, this is a bar graph that shows back in 2019, we were close to 50,000 students. And at this point we're about 43,000 students. And that's probably going to go down by another 500, I believe, for the following school year. I think a lot of people know that state school fund, which is our largest source of general fund revenue, is based on enrollment. When our enrollment decline outpaces the state, it decreases our percentage of the state school fund dollars. Expenses do not decline proportionately due to fixed costs. We still have to pay for finance staff. We still have to have a tech team. We still have custodians, even when we have fewer students and fewer state funds to support those positions, not to mention our teachers. And there's a long list. I didn't name everybody by any means. So for this current, for this spring, for the proposed budget, it means that we will be looking at at least a 30 million reduction for the 2425 school year. And originally we were saying it was going to be about 50%. 15 million and 15 million. As we finalized some of the numbers, we were able to soften the impact on the school based budgets just a small amount and increase the impact on the central budgets by a small amount. This next slide is going to show a running series of headlines that have run recently in a variety of publications throughout Oregon. And the reason we're showing this is just to say we really do have a statewide problem when it comes to the inadequacy of the School fund and our colleagues across the state are feeling that as well. And the size of your district and the amount of reserves that a school district has been able to hold onto have a significant impact on how school districts can react. When funding is short. Really small districts, their situation gets much more desperate, more quickly, but it's still felt throughout the state. The last slide about the statewide impact is just to give you a perspective of some of the numbers. I would point out Reedsport only because it is so small that they're now at a place we never want to see where they're actually reducing the school year and they're looking at furloughing teachers and employees. Other districts are large enough like Salem Keizer where I used to be, that they're looking at eliminating almost 400 positions. I will be very active now and when I'm not the interim superintendent. Helping state coalitions be built across the state so we can think about ways to bring people together, hopefully come together with some longer term solutions. I want to talk a little bit about some of the positives of what we focused on in terms of the impact to schools and to instruction. We did have to have a modest increase in class size. We're looking at about an average of one. That's an average. So I fully recognize that won't be felt in every classroom and that's one at our elementary classes. Our class sizes in Portland Public compared to what I see and I don't have a full analysis in front of me, but I have memories from Salem and other data I've seen. Our class sizes are pretty favorably here, favorable here, and that's part of the reason why we're able to operate such a robust curriculum. There's not a lot of districts that you find in this state and other states or districts like us in other states that are able to offer the wealth of choices for electives for career tech options. And when you do that, your staffing needs increase in order to support those dual language immersion programs as a specific example really requires some specific kind of staffing and thinking very carefully about how you can reduce and still offer quality programs throughout multiple years of a student's life. Here's another example of the class size slight increase. Just to show it looks a little bit like Legos, but it's actually intended to show that we fully recognize depending on the grade level, and this is just kindergarten through fifth. Depending on the grade level and depending on the size school you're in, your class size could be as high as 33, 34 or it could be as small as 9, 10 and 11. Students don't come to us bundled in even packages. And in some of our smaller buildings, it's more of a challenge to get creative on staffing if our numbers are going down. That's the purpose of this slide. We did try again. I can't say we were highly successful. We did our best in maintaining our efforts around things. This is the slide I wanted to come back to on how we support student achievement. We have been gaining instructional capacity by providing teachers best practices time to work with each other and professional learning communities. A really viable and deep curriculum with grade level appropriate resources and professional development, including instructional coaches. We're trying to continue the targeted academic interventions that we've had. Looking at middle grade experience, we know those transitions from elementary to middle and then middle to high are very precarious times for students to get the support they need to make those transitions. The athletic programs, the career tech offerings, those are very valuable in terms of learning for students. I continue to be impressed with the night when we had the two basketball teams in here and the coaches were talking about we're developing citizens, not just athletes and they're very motivating for students. It's real life kind of experiences that motivate them to continue to focus on academics as well. And we have the rapid response team for behavioral and mental health support. Those have increased dramatically since I left this seat in 2004. And my prediction is that they'll continue to have high level of needs. We won't have quite as robust summer programming as we have in the past, but we will have summer programming, credit recovery and then looking at school psychologists and other kind of staffing for social emotional needs by category in general. And I know the community is going to want a lot more specifics. We'll be working on that. Next is to okay, who's in the license? Educator. Not by name, not by title necessarily, but by grade levels or something that's a little more informative. But this is our first slice at it. These were the announcements that were made by principals and HR teams on February 12th. My understanding. And you'll see them by category here. And it totals just under 100 with a cost savings of 14.2. School district budgets have always have the highest percentage of their expenditures are in people. We're a very people intensive business. And so when we're about 80% of our expenditures come in personnel, then when you have significant budget reductions, you're going to see expenditure reductions in personnel. We also did a good hard look at central services reductions, centrally budgeted service reductions. Excuse me. So the top box are the people, number of administrators, licensed educators, and non licensed educators. Some of those are people who actually go into schools and do work with students, but they're not assigned to classrooms. And so that's why we're calling them licensed educators that are in the central office budget. This is just, I believe, the general fund reductions. Correct. Correct me on.

G: That'S mostly true, Dr. Husk. There are a few cases included in these numbers that there are other funds that have an impact on the general fund.

start time: 350:33:24.000
end time: 476:22:58.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Okay, thank you. And we did include custodial and security in a separate category because those folks are assigned to sites. So even though they're budgeted out of the central office budget, they are assigned to facilities that equals 13.5 FTE. And those are currently unfilled positions. Anytime we can stop hiring and reduce expenditures through reduction of positions and not have an impact on an existing staff member, that's always desirable. And we reduce purchase services, some contracts, some other things that we do by 2.6. So that's how we got to the 15.7 million reduction. These figures reflect all funds except for Head Start. That would be in a separate category, is my understanding. This next slide is a combination of the two funds combined. So it's simply doing the math and saying how many positions across the district, how did you get to 30 million in reduction? And that's the summary. I want to spend just a few minutes talking about one other topic that is sometimes hard to understand in school district budgets and probably other government budgets as well. School districts, home budgets, family budgets, government budgets tend to like to operate with what's called a reserve. Sometimes in government and school districts, we call it the ending fund balance and the beginning fund balance, but they both mean it's a reserve. And I'll explain that in just a minute. But if we weren't reducing our expenditures, you can see how quickly we have zero reserves and there's no option left of where to go. So the reserves would be completely depleted by 25, 26 if we were not taking these reductions. This board has a prudent policy to maintain a 5% reserve. And I'll explain that next. So I'm an educator. I was an elementary educator. So I hope you don't mind the simple example that I'm giving because it helps me if I can keep it simple for my own understanding. If you're fortunate enough to make $100,000 a year, and I want to emphasize, if you're Fortunate enough to make $100,000 a year. A lot of people are not fortunate enough to make that, but the number was also chosen because it makes the math easier to explain. But if you're fortunate enough to make $100,000 a year, maybe that's you and a partner, maybe that's your salary and, you know, your annual expenses for a household income, excuse me, expenditure for a year is going to be 103,000. So you've added up your rent and your mortgage, you've estimated your food, you've estimated the gas, the utilities, you know, college tuitions, clothing costs, whatever it is that your family prioritizes the spending. And you happen to have $10,000 in your savings account. That means you have a 10% reserve. That's not ongoing revenue, that's one time reserve. And you say, because this is a tight year, I'm going to take a risk and I'm going to use 3,000 of my $10,000 savings account for ongoing expenses. I'm deliberately choosing to take 3,000 out of my savings account and I'm spending it now on food, rent, whatever. You end the year with $7,000 the next year. Now the situation's tighter and you can see at the top, that's the year we're in. Coming up on right now. So now you still have a problem. And you say, okay, last year I took 3,000 out. Now we're going to cut out. No eating out, no movies. Whatever else it is you decide that you can reduce, I'm going to take 2,000 more out. Now I'm going to be down to 5,000 in my savings account. That's a 5% reserve. By year three, which is the 25, 26 year, which will be the most challenging budget building this district has seen in a while. You will be at your cap of 5%. So I hope this helps. People that are used to dealing with family incomes have some kind of an image of what happens with school district incomes. Because I like a lot of you, if I hear, oh, the district has $50,000 or 4 million, sorry, $50 million or $40 million in their reserve, that's a lot of money. And for a personal income, you would think, I won't have any problems ever again, that's a lot of money. But for a school district, if that reserve dollar amount, that's 40 or 50 million is a 5%, at a personal level, that means it's $5,000. That's why it's so important to understand this concept. When you look at large Budgets. So the final slide is taking that same concept. Not the final, excuse me, the next to the last. It's taking that same concept that Myung put together for me on a household income. And it's now playing it out on this school district's revenue for this school year expenditures, next school year reserve, which he's called here, beginning fund balance, ending fund balance because that's the terms that the finance people tend to use. And it shows that by 25, 26, 41.5 million will be a 5% reserve. That still sounds like a lot of money because we're thinking about personal finances for a district this size. If we have some kind of event where we have to do a quick shift with finances, that's all we've got left in that area for a cushion. And I don't know about you all, but 5% makes me nervous. So there will be another really tough list of cuts that will be proposed. I will not be here. I will do my best job handing off to the new superintendent and recommend that we begin the values discussions on the 25, 26 reductions just as soon as he or she gets here and has a time to do a 60 or 90 day transition in. But I'll put those recommendations together later because this is going to require a lot of energy and focus while we continue to lead, motivate and provide support to the wonderful employees that we have in this district. Excuse me. The last slide is talking about future dates. This is the beginning of a very public process of budget reduction, budget presentation and then budget work sessions and then budget approval by the board and then it moves on to a county something taxing agent I'm not familiar with, but Myong will tell you the initials in a minute the best that he can. And so those are the dates when a public can sign up to speak or there'll be other kinds of dialogue between board members and budget committee members that public can watch and participate in. I like focusing on the dates so I know when I can use my voice. But I really like focusing on those faces on the left because that's what we're doing it for. We want those students to walk across those graduation stages with pride, with confidence, with lifelong learning, and know that we prepared them to the best of our ability. Myung, was there anything you wanted to add on? I should have stopped before I got to the dates. Did you want to add anything on the multi year forecast? Back one slide, Alexandra.

G: Thanks, Dr. Husk. If I can just make maybe two comments just to highlight a couple Things they're sort of noted on the key points on the left hand side of the chart. Just wanted to number one, with respect to the 24, 25 comment, these numbers in this chart basically reflect the $30 million of reductions that Dr. Husk has described in this presentation and that we and you have been talking about for several months. So those reductions have been reflected in that total expense line. That's one comment. And that will allow the proposed budget to reflect that ending fund balance a little bit north of that 5% for this upcoming year. 24, 25. Those reductions are almost entirely ongoing reductions. So you may recall that in the past, in the past few months we've been talking about a $70 million gap for the third year in this time frame, the 25, 26 year. So what we're presenting is a budget that builds in $30 million of reductions that will take place next year, but also the following year. So that 70 million dollar gap has now been narrowed to 40 million dollars, give or take for 25, 26. And the only other thing I wanted to say, that last point on the left hand side where it says 25, 26, $40 million in additional revenues and or cost reductions will be needed to maintain a 5% reserve in that third year. So should there be by whatever circumstances or strenuous efforts, more revenues than are reflected in this chart in that third year, that 785, if that 785 goes up higher than 785, that will be part of the solution set that would bring that $40 million gap a little lower. So it's a combination of revenues, hypothetically at least of revenues and additional expenditure reductions that would solve for that gap in the third year.

A: Thank you so much. Board members, do we have any questions on the budget that has been presented to us this evening? I will start down at the end and we can just begin to work our way around and then we can volley back and forth after we've done that.

end time: 530:51:10.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Okay, I would just like to have you clarify. I think you just did clarify, but one more time. So in 25, 826 you're showing total expenses of 826, which would be mean keeping it like it is this year for expenses.

G: That's correct.

start time: 531:23:38.000
end time: 535:29:10.000

C: Okay. And so if we do that we end up with barely enough reserve at the end or just 5% reserve. Right.

confidence: 0.97
G: Sorry, Director Sullivan, let me try to clarify what's represented in that third column. If you look at the first few rows, just to kind of walk through it. If we were to start that third year with the beginning balance of 42.7 million, take in revenues of 785 million and spend 826 million, that would almost deplete the reserves to just over a million dollars. And that is not enough.

end time: 553:36:00.000

G: Combination of more revenues or additional expenditure reductions. So between those types of strategies, there would need to be a solution, solutions totaling about $40 million.

start time: 553:37:20.000
end time: 554:52:00.000

confidence: 0.91
D: Thank you. Thanks for the presentation, Dr. Rusk. It was very actually simple and straightforward, which I really appreciate. One thing I would just ask, as we move forward through the conversation, I think it'll be important to put some percentages on some of these numbers for context. So I think, particularly for the general public who's going to be looking at this, you know, it'll be useful. Sorry, I'm trying to go back to find this slide I was looking at, you know, when we talk about, you know, for instance, the school based, you know, reductions of 96.7 FTE or $14.2 billion, I think it would be important just to include, you know, what percentage. Last time I think you said that was roughly 2% of our school based budget. And then we were talking $15.7 million of centrally budgeted. I believe it's around 6%. So again, I just think that's important context because I think otherwise people come in and they say, well, wait a minute, why are you cutting the same number for each point?

start time: 573:09:39.000
end time: 573:12:43.000
confidence: 0.62
A: It is.

start time: 573:12:51.000
end time: 603:17:40.000
confidence: 0.93
D: So we want to make sure that we put in that context. It's a lot harder to cut the 6% than the two. It's hard to cut it all across the board. And then you said it. I think it's worth just saying again, because it seems to get lost a lot of the time that the budget, the proposed budget does propose to use 400.5 methods. So we hear that a lot from the community saying, you know, why aren't you using your reserves? Why aren't you using your reserves? We are, we're using $41.5 million and I think it's worth pointing out that that is the fact that we had those reserves is easing this year's budget. That again, over the last year we've heard a lot of criticism. Are the reserves $100 million? Had we not had that $100 million, we would have been cutting an additional 40.5 million. So I think this is what reserves are intended for, particularly when they're above the target amount is when we're facing cuts. It helps ease into the cuts rather than having to cliff. You can sort of have a ramp. And so I'm glad we're able to do that. The other thing I want to stress the 5% best practice in financial and public budgeting is to have 16.5% which is only 2% or it's only two months of an operating fund. So often 65% sounds like a lot but when you think about it, it's only 2% of your operating fund. So I just want to stress our 5% minimum is less than one month of operating fund for the district. So it is a very small amount and it should make us very nervous. Dr. Raskill, as you said, I do support going there in terms of this budget and try to ease into it. Trying to remain optimistic that the state, even though they've got our summer school funding for this particular year, maybe they'll come through in the future, which is why I support this. But it is a bare minimum.

start time: 605:38:00.000
end time: 620:14:36.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Great questions and suggestions on the percentages. I think part of the sense making we need to do with the community is being able to share as much as possible the bigger picture. And I appreciate the household budget example people can relate to. We've known this is going to be a challenging year and I appreciate the team putting together the budget. I'm going to have a. I'll have a series of questions that I'm going to submit for the record but I have some here for tonight. I also want to note that the while our current local option goes through this next year that the following year's numbers which when our levy is complete that it's predicating those 25, the 2526 numbers assume that we're going to renew the levy. Correct?

start time: 620:17:48.000
end time: 620:34:04.000
confidence: 0.74
D: That's correct.

start time: 620:36:12.000
end time: 646:57:54.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Building in that assumption that we'll pass renew their levy this spring which is about 650 teaching positions. So important to note that I'm glad to see the middle school investments, the growth of the rapid response team, the summer programming, the page of the things that we're maintaining because I know that Many of those areas are ones that we've really focused on building out and building capacity and supports for our students. So I'm glad that we're able to retain the essence of them and do some new things. So to my just questions, there's some that you can provide answers to, written answers to. But I like the 250 FTE positions that are proposed to be cut to get just a general function, a list of the general function, each of those whether they're filled positions or unfilled and represented or non represented. So that's something I can provide later or as a follow up. This is another follow up. Just there is the funds, the funds by object table which is essentially types of expenditures. Could you provide if there are any of the fund types that we're increasing increasing by over 5% and then this may be able to answer Julia, can.

C: I just ask, I'm sorry Director Brim Edwards, can I ask a quick question? I didn't understand your last question but if Myung did, I'm fine. Moving on.

start time: 649:36:10.000
end time: 656:34:00.000
confidence: 0.92
G: Can I try to confirm my understanding? Dr. Hoskin? Director Brim Edwards are you looking for comparison between the current year and the proposed budget expenditures by major object so personnel benefits, etc. Cases where there's an increase or a change of more than 5%.

start time: 657:11:00.000
end time: 674:40:16.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Then this is a special ed question. So I continue to get a fair amount of questions about the extent of changes in special ed and I'm wondering over the next month and a half whether there's going to be a more extensive conversation. I primarily of course get questions from parents who have children in special ed and just I'm trying to understand whether this is a budget change or it's a programming change. And I know we got a very detailed memo outlining them, but I'm still getting a lot of questions. And so part of it would be I'm wondering if there's going to be a more sort of general discussion like an opportunity for special ed parents not just one on one but to get sort of walk through them. I think there's, I mean very legitimate concerns parents have when there's a significant change to child has vulnerabilities. So that would be just one thing for consideration.

start time: 674:43:28.000
end time: 677:13:52.000
confidence: 0.98
C: I can answer that really quickly if you want. The community meetings are scheduled and we're getting ready to communicate the schedule out to the public and I'll make sure you have it first.

start time: 677:16:56.000
end time: 678:01:04.000
confidence: 0.96

confidence: 1.00
A: Great.

start time: 682:06:10.000
end time: 700:39:10.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Because they have some really specific questions that I can't answer. Also based on that it looks like a fair amount of it is based on para also having sort of fully funding and staffing our paraeducator positions. And a follow up piece of information I'm interested in is are we anticipating that on the first day of school we'd have all those para positions? I know in the past we've had challenges filling them. Hopefully we've made some changes that those would be filled. So like what's our prediction and then what the average vacancy rate? Because it does seem like the sped reductions do seem predicated on having this robust set of supports from paraeducators. The the title schools have expanded from 25 to 36 and I'm curious whether the title money that we are receiving, is it going to increase from this year to next year with the increase in the number of schools or is it the same size pie divided by more schools and what is that number?

start time: 700:49:30.000
end time: 702:10:48.000
confidence: 0.98
C: My understanding is the title dollars have gone down slightly but I'll get you exact numbers.

start time: 702:13:14.000
end time: 702:44:28.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So they've gone down and.

start time: 702:46:44.000
end time: 703:13:00.000
confidence: 0.95
C: And we're spreading them further.

start time: 703:15:00.000
end time: 706:38:20.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Spreading them further. Yeah, that would be helpful again I think because to make sense of like every individual school, what exactly is happening? It's a variety of things so we can do that. Play that out.

start time: 706:39:00.000
end time: 706:50:40.000
confidence: 0.50
A: Okay.

start time: 708:00:20.000
end time: 715:50:40.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Of the 250 FTEs being reduced in 2023, Covid or the Esser grants to schools totaled about 8.3 million and paid for looks like from the chart that was supplied 57 FTE. I'm assuming since this budget doesn't have those one time grants in it again, that the 57 FTE are part of the 250 FTE cuts.

start time: 716:16:20.000
end time: 734:11:00.000
confidence: 0.96
G: My understanding is that the 250 that I believe you're referencing, Director Brim Edwards, is from the adopted budget from 2324 compared to the proposed budget for 2425 and happy to get any corrections on this. What I'm about to share, my understanding is that at the time the 2324 budget was adopted because of the process and the timing by which schools submitted spending plans for those school improvement grants, that there was a bit of a mix that some of those positions were known and included, but not all of them were. So unfortunately I don't believe that there was 100% consistency reflected in the 2324 adopted budget pertaining to the positions funded by those Site based school improvement grants.

start time: 734:24:40.000
end time: 735:30:40.000
confidence: 0.88
F: We got a printed out list that had that totaled up to 57 of.

start time: 735:31:20.000
end time: 739:15:00.000
confidence: 0.94
G: All 57 FTE of all the partial that's known now. But at the time the last June that the budget was adopted that was sort of in progress as my understanding.

start time: 739:40:50.000
end time: 747:48:44.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Just follow this. If that was one time funds and the 8 million. There's no Esser grant $100,000 grants coming out this year that whatever FTE was funded last year with that those funds. There's not going to be that those funds this year. So that could be another explanation in addition to the title changes as well why there's fewer fte.

start time: 747:50:52.000

B: Thank you. Call me Chair to pass. That's an old title but thank you. Thanks for this presentation to I have a couple of questions. One is about the column projected 2526. Are we projecting further enrollment decrease so those numbers are built into the 2526 projections?

B: So it looks like we have an opportunity to either increase our revenue which would be perfect if we lobby the state or and or decrease expenses in that year three as well in 2526. Is that true? Is that accurate?

confidence: 0.94
B: Thank you. And then the last question I have is it doesn't need to be answered right now if we don't have the expertise in the room but the experience. The adult experience versus the child to student experience and the sped area arts and library. Some of the special. If we could have an explanation of what the adult experience is versus the student experience that would be helpful for me.

confidence: 0.94
E: I know that one of the things with the Esser funds different schools had flexibility in using in different ways. Is there again this doesn't have to be now. This could be sent later. Is there any way we could get like a rundown, like just totals about like how much were spent on EAs.

confidence: 0.92
E: And that just. Yeah, because it would be. I don't know if it was in volume two because honestly we got this Saturday and 600 pages and the other question I have was there was. Looks like there's some changes in how the equity allocations are done in the grade to K through eight base schools. I was wondering if I could get up like some, you know, obviously it's trying to target the highest needs as well, but there's some changes. I was wondering if there's get a high level kind of rundown of what that looks like and what the decision making process went into it.

A: Didn'T have a lot of questions, but as I stated earlier earlier today, I have pause and I want to share my pause and I'm hoping that as we begin to dive into this that we will begin to see it more. I'm looking for the disaggregated data around the disproportion of what it feels like, the disproportion of those that are being impacted by this budget cut. I'm concerned that we're balancing our budget on the backs of the black and brown staff, that we're balancing our budget on the backs of those that are most marginalized, that we're balancing our budgets on the backs of those in the most need. That may not be the case, but again, I want to see the data that would tell me that I'm wrong. So I'm looking for the methodology that we used when we were deciding to make these cuts, when we were starting to go down the line. What methodology were we using? What formulas that we put in place for us to be a district that prides ourselves on being equitable, not equal, but equitable? What methodology did we use when we went across? What equity lens did we use when we went across and we're beginning to make the cuts? Did we say this is what we need to do, this is what we have to do? I am not saying that we're not going to have to make cuts. I am not saying that everybody is going to get out of this unharmed. What I'm trying to determine, what I'm looking to see is the methodology, the equity based lens that we looked at everything that we were doing through and did we get to the same place based on that or was it simply, you know this. There's a good sized chunk of money here, let's pull a million dollars from that. There's a good sized chunk of money here, let's pull some. I want to know what the methodology was and how we decided the formulas that were put in place and the lenses that we looked through. There has to be rubric somewhere that I believe is out there that does that. Again, I'm not saying that this is the case. That's why I said it's caution and it's concern. And I believe that for, for the people that, for the people that, that have the concern, they're asking the same questions that I'm asking right now because this isn't even a new question for me. This is one that community has been asking me over and over and over again and I, I want to know. So for the record, I'm asking the question so that for the record we can get a response that makes sense not just to me but to everybody. Everybody watching.

start time: 852:29:10.000
end time: 888:56:48.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Thank you Vice Chair and Green and also I want to say publicly because I know you and I have discussed this, some of those numbers we can get you fairly soon in a few weeks. Some of them it's going to be longer towards the end, the end of June as we keep moving people into other positions. So we want to make sure that anyone who's unassigned and that could be administrator, it could be a teacher, it could be a classified staff member that they currently know that their position is gone, are hoping to work in pps, HR and all of us are very committed to keeping them in the district. So it's going to take some time to say to you exactly what the disaggregated data is because that hiring process and that placement process does not happen quickly. It will happen over the next couple of months. Plus we will keep looking at it and we will bring you what you have. We have when you. We will bring you what we have when we have it. I guess it's me back to me. I did take some time today to look at volume two of the budget which shows what each school is receiving per student. And it really does look to me from that that it was taken into consideration that the schools that were having the most problem with test scores were getting the most money, which I was really glad to see. So I mean obviously it didn't took about two hours to look through just kind of casually, but that really helped me to look at that. And then another question I had probably For Myung is on page 89, volume one. It's summary of requirements by Major Object General Funds. I just, I don't quite understand the difference between budget and budget fte. Okay, yeah.

start time: 888:59:44.000
end time: 894:38:58.000
confidence: 0.96
G: So the short answer is that budget FTE basically represents positions. So the number of full time equivalent staff member staff positions. So all the figures that don't say FTE, which is all but two of those columns are dollars.

start time: 894:40:34.000
end time: 894:54:10.000
confidence: 0.78
C: Oh, okay.

start time: 894:55:30.000
end time: 899:02:42.000
confidence: 0.97
G: But the two columns that say FTE, budget FTE 23, 24 in the middle and then on the right hand side, budget FTE 24, 25, those are all basically counts of numbers.

start time: 899:03:46.000
end time: 900:52:10.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Okay. And then of course we don't have adopted yet because we haven't adopted it. Okay, Right.

start time: 900:54:10.000
end time: 907:12:26.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Those will be filled in when these documents that you have so far are the proposed budget documents. After the budget is approved and then adopted, there will be another set of documents that look very similar to this, but they will reflect the official adopted.

start time: 907:12:58.000
end time: 910:26:50.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Budget and also the budget for 2324. Does that show the actual budget? Not what was proposed as the budget.

start time: 910:28:10.000
end time: 912:41:10.000
confidence: 0.97
G: It's the adopted budget for this year. So what the board adopted this was before I was here, but last June.

start time: 913:06:10.000
end time: 914:43:38.000
confidence: 0.87
C: But didn't we end up probably spending more than that because of raises in salary and so.

start time: 914:44:34.000
end time: 915:07:54.000
confidence: 0.90
G: Correct, correct.

start time: 915:10:02.000
end time: 915:32:42.000
confidence: 0.99
C: So it was really higher.

start time: 915:35:46.000
end time: 918:32:51.000
confidence: 0.98
G: Right. So when you see on that table the figures that say actual for the prior years, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22.

start time: 918:34:36.000
end time: 918:42:30.000
confidence: 0.99
C: 23.

start time: 919:12:50.000
end time: 928:18:32.000
confidence: 0.98
G: In the next year's version of these documents, you will see actual numbers for 23, 24 will be higher than that. Yes, because by then we will have closed the books this year, the audit will have been complete. And so those numbers will be similar in terms of the point in the process to the columns that say actual. It's just kind of moving one year further as we get those audited actual results.

D: In the memo doctor as that you provided was just some information, I think we noted that of the position actually let me ask the first question getting back to directors. I want to make sure you understand the budget presentation. I talked about 204 positions cut but then you also talked about 250. And I think if you understood you that's the difference between the adopted budget and the proposed budget is 250.

start time: 950:02:40.000
end time: 958:08:40.000
confidence: 0.96
G: That's correct. All funds adopted to proposed. What we're showing in the this presentation is not necessarily from the adopted budget from last year but the latest current information about the positions and doesn't include Head Start as was noted in the slide and it doesn't include the positions that were funded on the Esser School Improvement Grants.

start time: 958:10:00.000
end time: 966:32:10.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Okay, thanks for the clarification. In this memo you note that well maybe this was just central office. Anyway, you notice that the total FDA reductions in the Central office about 61% were filled and 39% are vacant. I guess a twofold question of the cuts on the so of the Central office cuts, 61% are filled. There's a little more than 100. So it's fair to say we're having between 60 and 70 layoffs.

start time: 966:55:10.000
end time: 971:12:50.000
confidence: 0.95
C: We're having 60 to 70 transitions. We're hoping that people whose positions are titles are going away and that they qualify for another position that they will want to work with HR and see if there's another place for them in the system.

start time: 971:21:50.000
end time: 973:19:30.000
confidence: 0.87
D: Okay. So if there are positions obviously working with them and I'm talking about central office. Okay. And layoff notice is that.

start time: 974:20:20.000
end time: 985:03:50.000
confidence: 0.95
C: No. Sharon, do you want to come to the table please? This gets a little confusing and so I'm glad you're asking. Some positions are so unique and the background of the individual is so unique that when they're told the position is going away, they assume rightfully so that there's not going to be an option for them. When you're talking about administrators like principals, vice principals or teachers, it depends on what they're certified in and where we have openings. So that's why we're so careful in using the language and let me finish the question.

start time: 985:05:50.000
end time: 994:20:58.000
confidence: 0.93
D: There may be other parts you want to what I was really sort of just trying to get at was again we eliminate a lot of positions. We try and transition as many people and I was trying to really get a sense of do we anticipate layoffs on the school based side because I know in prior years when we've had teaching reductions we've been able to say that in the end we didn't end up with the layoffs, we ended up with assignments but found positions from those people. What's that look like on the school based side and what does that look like on the central office side? And I know you can't give me exact answers because the numbers are always moving. So just rough estimates.

start time: 994:23:54.000

F: Great.

start time: 994:32:18.000
end time: 1008:46:00.000
confidence: 0.94
C: So what I can verify is that employees have been informed as to whether or not their current position is funded for next year. And following from that is what Dr. Husk has already referred to as the unassignment and attempting to find new positions that employees are qualified for. So what we can anticipate. First of all, it's too early to tell for. For most positions we can anticipate that there will be layoffs in the central office. That's easier because there are fewer overlap of qualifications and smaller volume of positions. And with regard to school based staff we are anticipating. And again, it's too early to tell that there may be layoffs in some areas.

D: Another thing in the memo I just wanted. I noted that there was a question about the Southeast Guiding coalition positions. And I know the board had passed the camera's resolution or not, but you know, sort of adding 10 positions back. If we note in the memo that those 10 positions are being retained. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the thinking behind cut system. By kind of getting back to Director Green's point. I understand why we wanted to help the Southeast schools through that transition. But now as we're looking at system wide reductions, what was the policy rational behind retaining those 10 versus some of the other areas of the district that are also struggling with cuts reductions?

start time: 1022:18:20.000
end time: 1047:33:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I'm just going to be very transparent here. When I was given the budget recommended recommendations from the previous administration, I didn't ask because I didn't know that we had a Southeast Guiding coalition referendum, or would you call it a resolution? Sorry, resolution. So I didn't ask questions about it. When I heard that there had been a commitment from the board in a resolution for those positions, I directed staff to put them in as in the proposed budget and that we would let the budget discussion move forward to see if any decisions were made on changing any of our recommendations, not just specific to this one. I did have a very informative meeting today with Director Grim Edwards and Director Wong to help me understand the why behind some of the program impacts when the boundaries were redrawn. And so we're going to have. There were two wonderful staff members with me, Dr. Franco and Dr. Adams. We're going to meet with the 10 principals of the schools that are most impacted by the changes that were made several years ago and listen to what their current needs are, hear what their current predictions are of where they would need additional staffing. After that, we can circle back to the whole board and say, do we think that you all should have a discussion about this specific to all 10 or only specific to 10 to. Or whatever we. As we learn. But I really do think we need to communicate with the principals first, because I've not had that conversation.

start time: 1047:36:30.000
end time: 1067:59:24.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Yeah, I think that makes sense. I guess what I would just. As an individual board member, you know, it was a very different time when we approved that we're looking at a very different budget. I also. I voted for it at the time. I was concerned about the precedent it sets in terms of allocating specific staff to specific schools and specific area. I really think that's something the superintendent should do. We should give overall guidance and what we're looking for as a board. But the superintendent should look to see where that is, because I will tell you today that, you know, Markham and Gray are suffering significantly. And if we're talking about specific schools that need, you know, potentially additional staff to deal with their school closures and transitions and all that's going on, I would think that, too. I don't want to bring a separate resolution for that because, again, I think it's better for the district to look holistically, and that's something that the superintendent can do, not the board. But I just want to put that out there. I. I would want these positions to be in this. I wouldn't want you to feel as though the board has a special allocation for this school. I would want you to put these in the same criteria as everything else. And if, in your view and staff, they're needed, that great, we should keep them. And if they're not, I think we as a board should do that resolution.

start time: 1068:01:32.000
end time: 1072:56:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Well, I will definitely concur with you. In general. Now, stop. In general, I concur. Any resolution that makes a commitment to staffing multiple years out is always fraught with some risk. But I do think there's enough history here that I need to learn more about the current needs from the people most closely impacted.

start time: 1073:15:00.000
end time: 1073:39:40.000
confidence: 0.91
F: I'll just say so.

D: It was.

start time: 1074:24:30.000
end time: 1120:18:28.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Can I just follow on this? So it's Resolution 6513. And so Director Wong, as a parent, served on the Southeast Guidance Coalition. And I, because it covers my zone, we're very involved in this. But the resolution has, you know, pages of changes of boundaries and programs and other things. And also there was a decision decision by the board to continue our sibling policies and some others allowing students to sort of have this trailing right to complete their highest grades. And because of that, the process ended with some schools under enrolled, quite a few of them. And when that tail plays out, hopefully and when the boundary changes go into effect that we'll be closer to the goals we set. But everybody knew there was going to be this transition period. There were also just a number of schools that were heavily, heavily impacted. Creative Science school now is at a neighborhood school and the neighborhood schools are still there. You had the closing of the Lent neighborhood program and moving them to Marysville. I mean they were just. Some schools had minimal. Maybe they had lost three or four blocks of families and a boundary change. But there were some that were very impacted. And from my perspective. So it says in here that they'll be allocated over the next five years. It doesn't say which schools. It says s program and boundaries change from one school to another. And providing full programming for low enrollment schools that will grow over five years. I'd be. So it's not specifically. It's going to this specific school. Again, the general staffing that occurs with the central office staff in consultation with the principals. The one thing I would be concerned is the board change it now. Just I feel that it will. I mean it was. That was a super hard process on schools that generally serve a lot of historically underserved students. And it would seem to be. I mean, I'll just say it like having sat there in the meetings, like they felt like this is the one of the things they some stability they got out of a process that really destabilized a lot of schools. And that if we went back and said no, we've changed our mind even though we voted at the resolution that had all these other changes. I think it will be harder in the future to make other changes if.

F: Don'T follow through with what we said, how we're going to support schools. And I certainly don't want to send FTE to schools unnecessarily. So there's no room all. But I would expect that if we have already most of the schools don't have foundations or any way to like make up for the cuts if they don't have schools. So I would be concerned about removing those fte.

confidence: 0.92
E: If I can. It's okay if you want to respond, just kind of give a real example. It might help kind of. I think one of the reasons that it's important that this was a long term commitment. I think it's five year commitment.

start time: 1131:55:28.000
end time: 1132:03:10.000

G: Right.

start time: 1132:05:20.000
end time: 1136:33:38.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I mean, I'm hopeful that after looking at the numbers, this decision would come naturally anyways. And like, to give a real, real example, one of the things that happened in the SCGC that was really problematic was that, you know, there was a number set for middle schools.

start time: 1136:33:54.000
end time: 1136:37:06.000
confidence: 0.35
A: Yeah.

start time: 1136:37:38.000
end time: 1138:46:10.000
confidence: 0.97
E: As we're converting all our K8s into middle school, the number was like 500 students. To be able to offer robust programming.

start time: 1138:47:30.000
end time: 1138:50:42.000
confidence: 0.79
A: Right.

start time: 1138:51:06.000
end time: 1178:10:00.000
confidence: 0.94
E: You need enough students to able to offer music class and art too. Right. And band. And one of the problems was that as we were during the SCGC process, decisions were made that put some schools at bigger risk than others. And one of them was Harrison Park. Harrison park is, as you know, is a very diverse school. It's title one and it's kind of like on the border of Portland Public. So it's already a naturally, because it's on the edge, has a naturally difficult time with the catchment area. Right. And it was purposely done in a way that was very risky because you know, a lot of people wanted to stay at Kellogg, brand new building. You know, we all know that, that story. And so what happened was that the assumptions was that Harrison park would house a new Mandarin immersion program and it was dependent on the Mandarin Motion program all move over to Harrison park in order to keep the numbers at a satisfactory number. The problem in reality what happened was that, you know, a lot of middle schoolers started in Hosford, they didn't want to finish, you know, they just figured they want to finish out their middle school experience in the same school and not move schools or their siblings went with them too. And so what happened was that Harrison park ended up being very, very under enrolled. And the part of the reason for this long term commitment and a lot of people brought this concern up, which is why this long term commitment was brought up as a band aid. And the way it would help is that over time, as that population ages out and we have a new batch of kids moving in that aren't following their siblings to the same schools. It would give Harrison Park's enrollment numbers time to grow. And so if we were to enroll at the numbers they were currently at without the help, they would be, you know, be under rolled, less robust programming than other middle schools in the area and things like that. So that's like a real example of like why part of the reason this commitment is very important. Again, I am also hopeful that just naturally looking at the numbers, it would have that 10ft would have naturally gone in these schools anyways. But yeah, I'm also willing to hear your report and do what's best for all our students.

start time: 1178:20:20.000
end time: 1187:38:14.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Can I just add also that if the schools in the southwest that were really impacted, that my expectation is that staff would look at that if they're needed to have additional FTE support because of the disruption that's been caused. Like, I would fully expect that to be part of that FTE set aside. So I don't see it as a zero sum. I would hope that we'd address other students who had a significant impact.

start time: 1187:41:02.000
end time: 1222:07:30.000
confidence: 0.92
D: And I think that's exactly the point. I'm not going to argue at all about the impacts to the southeast schools that you've all laid out. Absolutely. Those impacts are what I'm trying to point out. Actually, to your point that you just made director for better, it's. You're suggesting that the district look at whether those southwest schools need to help. I would say the same thing should be true of the Southeast coalition. My concern is that as a board, we have stepped in in one area and said you have to allocate teachers to those schools, but we haven't done it to the other areas. And it is a zero sum game because we are in a budget process. There are a limited number of teachers. And so those teachers, if the Southwest Parker is going to need additional teachers because of the trauma that that community has gone through this year, they have to come from somewhere. And I don't know where the best place for them to come from. If the superintendent says we're going to need to surge some staff capacity over there and wants to look around for that. I just think as a board, once we've passed a resolution that says, oh, these schools get this additional amount, everyone else kind of, you know, fend for yourself. That's what concerns me. And you know, and again, we've avoided as a board and this one, I've been on it a lot of the sort of zone, you know, turf wars about a lot of, you know, there's actually very few examples similar to this where we sort of said we want resources to one particular area. I certainly don't want to get into that, you know, but I want to make sure that because we have a resolution on the books, I want to make sure that staff don't feel bound and sane. We wouldn't actually put 10, maybe we would only put seven or eight. Maybe we'd use two or three in other places. Whether it's southwest schools, whether it's Northwest schools, whether it's north schools and they're feeling constrained because of what we did as a board. And I want to make sure that if they are feeling that we're having that conversation because that's what troubles me is when we sort of look at one issue in isolation and then we don't really think about the impact because it does have an impact. Those 10 positions came out of our budget. They came from somewhere else. And I just want to make sure it's the highest priority.

start time: 1222:15:50.000
end time: 1247:50:50.000
confidence: 0.96
F: I guess I would just Note that for 15 years students at the under enrolled K8s got a totally inequitable middle grades experience compared to students who stayed in that were. So there was no, you know, change to a lot of the frankly, the middle schools that represented parts of the district that had very robust enrollment that didn't necessarily serve historically underserved schools. So it was on top of it. I think most people in the south, those schools in the southeast guiding coalition would be like, we would be happy not to have the 10. But like if we hadn't had to go through the year and a half of what we went through, like we got selected to go through this process. I mean it was a year and a half of really hard conversations the school community. And to me, I look at the resolution and all the things I've done over my 11 years on the board that was one of the most complicated, the most boundary changes seen the district do in 25 years in one fell swoop, the most program changes. So I understand your point and actually I don't think all 10 of the FTEs were actually distributed over the last. I see Dr. Adams nodding. So it hasn't always been the case. Again, I welcome the conversation the staff will have with the principals about sort of where they are.

B: More question about Head Start? It was referenced in the memo. Those are our littlest learners. And it seems like the best opportunity or a very strong opportunity to close the achievement gap is by focusing on those early learners. And we also know preschool costs are really high and Head Start serves our poorest immigrant, refugee, black and brown students. And so do we have a solid plan for. Do we have a heat map of where the need is?

E: In Portland, we're older. Right. And so I guess one of the questions I'm asking is that, you know, this goes back into Director DePass questions. You know, what does the experience for the students look like? And one of the things that gives kids of color a leg up oftentimes is when they have a teacher or staff member that looks like them. Right? Yeah, even the general. Anybody? Any staff. But yeah, just having adults in the building, that's diverse. One of the challenges that I think every district across the country faces is that often as the population becomes more diverse, the diverse hires tend to be the latest hires. And according to. With most public contracts agreements, it tends to be based on seniority. And so again, this is kind of a difficult question to ask because I don't really, I don't want details because I don't want to like, obviously there's HR issues. You don't want to, like, identify people. Right. But the question is, what? And this doesn't have to be answered in public, but I'm just curious about, you know, just higher level. So that's not identifying anyone. Just kind of curious about the types of efforts that have been put in place to try to protect some of, you know, trying to still build diversity in our, in our workforce and helping our students.

start time: 1301:46:10.000
end time: 1325:53:50.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Definitely. That's why we had our HR rep at the table. But I'd like to add to that that the shortage of people going into education schools in general is another huge, looming problem. And I've seen districts that are not in our current situation but have a little bit more breathing room, do some very creative things around enabling staff in our community to get supports to go into the education field. So we're not recruiting and retaining. We're growing our own and finding ways to Support people. And I would love for us to get to a place where HR and our union leadership could work with local universities and talk about some creative things we could do around scholarships. I found in Salem. We were recruiting a lot of times from other states where there were higher Spanish speaking populations. Salem has a significant number of Spanish speaking students, but they missed their families and they go back. And so we invested quite a bit in working with three local universities and really started seeing a change in the diversity that way. So I would hope that we would look at it in a broader context of who we currently have and who we're keeping. But what's the long range vision of how we could have even more of an impact?

F: Okay, these are probably some things that you can. I can just get. I'd like to have the budget chart field for the board of education budget. The budget chart field for the superintendent its office.

confidence: 0.94
F: The budget chart field for the board of education budget and also the budget chart field for the superintendent's office. So that the board is just obviously our budget and then obviously we have and the auditors are in the board budget and then the other employee that we have is the superintendent. So just to be able to see the superintendent's budget that's being proposed. Question does this budget in the last I think two years ago the board put into the budget an equitable field trip and travel fund. That was 500,000. Is that in this year's budget?

start time: 1359:36:40.000
end time: 1361:11:28.000
confidence: 0.84
G: Proposed budget? Director Brim Edwards. Did you just say the student travel equity fund?

start time: 1361:12:24.000
end time: 1361:48:00.000
confidence: 0.90
F: It's the equitable field trip and travel fund.

start time: 1361:50:00.000
end time: 1365:29:10.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Yes, that is included. That was put in place in this year's budget as I understand it, or expanded to middle schools in this year's budget. And that's continuing Great, thank you.

F: There's 2.5 million in non personnel cuts which are supplies and services. And I'd just be interested in more details on that. I think we'll find over the next month of a lot of people who have some great ideas like you should cut X. And it's like, oh, that's already on the list. So I think just having that so that we know what things are already being trimmed and what's being proposed being trim and what's being saved and says maybe Ms. Reese, something. Chief Reese, it's something you could answer. There's 10 million cuts that were made in 23, 24. Were those all one time reductions or they mix or the ongoing reductions. So often there's some narrative around that 10 million that talks about a hiring freeze which implies that it's not a permanent 10 million. So curious is that 10 million we can book that and then we're carrying that in. Or if they're hiring freezes, that implies that actually some of the savings go away.

start time: 1384:53:20.000
end time: 1399:06:52.000
confidence: 0.96
G: We can tag team a little bit. I think the short answer is it is a bit of a mix. So of the positions that were frozen since December, some of those positions have been eliminated in the proposed budget that we're discussing tonight. And some of those positions, although they haven't been filled this year, are still budgeted for next year and will be, if the budget is approved, will be proceeding to be available to fill. I don't have a specific number of how many fall in each category. We could try to reach that and be more give you a report about that. But it is a bit of a blend.

start time: 1399:07:56.000
end time: 1403:02:00.000
confidence: 0.88
F: Yeah, it would be useful. Not just like the broad split because for example, if say 2 million of it is like a freeze, but actually we're going to hire people, that means that we would have 2 million more to.

start time: 1404:01:40.000
end time: 1405:28:32.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I hear your question and I think we can get that for you. Okay. It just, I will tell you, maybe.

start time: 1405:29:36.000
end time: 1440:19:40.000
confidence: 0.94
F: It'S the word hiring freeze that's throwing me off because if it were, because it implies it's a one time cut. And my assumption was we're going to do 10 million here and that carries through and then the 30 million carries through to next 26. There's eight and a half campus security agents that are being reduced. I know this past year we had a record year of gun violence in Portland and we had probably an unprecedented way around some southeast schools, multiple gun violence, just gun incidents. And I'm curious about. And there was a very significant, I think Director Green, you and Chair Hollins were on the sort of safety task force task force. Thank you. That made a series of recommendations. And this was also about not having school resource officers in our schools. That substitute was campus safety, especially with all the gun violence that was happening. So I'm curious about where Those. What the 8.5 cuts were and kind of what the criteria were. And I joined the same question about Head start that Director DePass had. Head Start is we've always had the largest Head Start program in the state. Why are we having low enrollment, especially at Applegate? I think that served historically native students. So a lot of curiosity piece. I have a question about the high school staffing. Is that my understanding is that this year the high schools are staffing using an equity formula that all schools get some equity funds. This is a Dr. Adams question.

start time: 1440:20:20.000
end time: 1440:31:20.000
confidence: 0.88
C: I think.

start time: 1441:00:20.000
end time: 1446:06:46.000
confidence: 0.91
F: Because in the past there was a threshold and you had historically underserved students, but they were. It was under the say it was. I don't know what the number was under 15%. You didn't get any equity staffing. And that now, now all the high schools get it.

start time: 1446:07:58.000

C: Sure.

start time: 1448:52:30.000
end time: 1452:04:42.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I know it's been a long conversation about that particular piece. Like oh, we're you know, 2 percentage over the threshold so we don't get any. But we still have students in our schools that are underserved.

start time: 1452:05:46.000
end time: 1452:10:18.000

C: Right.

start time: 1452:11:14.000
end time: 1458:44:36.000
confidence: 0.93
F: And then my. If you could also include. Understand that we only did that for high schools. So we still have middle schools, K8s and elementary schools that again have historically underserved students. And just sort of the rationale, I understand it's like a budgetary issue, but it would be helpful to be able to again explain it.

I'm not sure if it's just adding up all the ones in the school based book that it has. What FTE is projected to be paid for by foundations.

I'd like to, if we could get some sort of timeline provided to us within the next couple of days as to when we can expect to get a response to some of these back. Maybe not the answers, but if I can get within the next couple of days a timeline that states this is when we're going to get you those responses and this is what you can expect.

end time: 1617:29:20.000
confidence: 0.97
A: As soon as we can get it, I'd like a timeline because what I don't want to get in the, in the space of is some of these questions have been asked before, they're not new. And so I want to make sure that this time as we're saying that, you know, we're going to get back, you know, get back with us because we got a million things to do. It's not like, you know, I don't think Dr. Adams is sitting over there and he ain't got nothing else to do trying to figure out if he can grow hair or not. You know what I'm saying? Because I know he's looking at the same websites that I do. Like, is the bald spot gonna grow in? I don't know, but I'm sure, I'm sure he's busy. I just want to make sure that at the same time that we're being intentional about getting back to us about the responses that we need. The other thing I want to make sure that I speak to is that you're absolutely correct when you speak to the shortage of the teachers coming in, that is a real thing when we start thinking about diversity coming into our district. But another just as real thing is the way that we build up, the way that we support and the way that we develop the ones that we currently have. Because those that are looking are looking to see how we're treating the ones that we have. And if we're not being loved on, if they're not being supported, if they're not being built up, then even the ones that may want to come won't come. And so I'd like us to really take a look at that. I know that in the past we have had administrators of color equity report that was done that we have really yet to do anything with. So as much as we're sitting around talking about, we want to see what can be done. I'm curious to what we've done with what we already know, right? Like we need to do something with what we've already been given before we start talking about there's something new out there that we can try. Sometimes it's not the new stuff that needs to be tried. Sometimes it's just, you know, shoring up the old stuff that we have. And I'd like to see something done with that. And again, I want to just appreciate everybody, everybody here. Thank you for coming out of retirement for us. Thank y'all for sitting at the dais and dealing with this. I even want to say thank you to the people out there that's got signs. Those of you that are holding it up, I appreciate your signs. I want to make sure that we share this. I don't believe that anyone comes to these meetings simply because they hate the people on the other side. I believe that we come to these meetings because we're genuinely concerned about the well being of our kids, of our schools, of our district as a whole. And we all have different ideas maybe on how we go about getting there, whether we take Lombard or whether we take Columbia. But, you know, we're trying to get to the same place. And what we're struggling to understand right now is why did you choose Rosa Parks? Like, it has too many turns, it stops at a certain point. You have to go down. And so we're trying to make sense of something. But the one thing that is true is that we all care about our kids. And we bring our passion, we bring our concern to these meetings because this is where we're supposed to bring it. This is we're supposed to voice our opinion. So I want to make sure that I say to each one of y'all sitting out there, thank you. I don't want you to think that I don't appreciate you. I don't want you to think that I'm bothered by the signs. Sometimes we ask you to put them down and that's just so that other people can see. It's not that I don't want to see your sign. I just want other people to be able to stare at me and give me that eye to make sure that they know that I know that they're looking at me and I know they're looking at me and I can't get away from it. And so I want you to put your signs down so they can stare at me. But at the end of the day, I really want you to know how much I appreciate you all. I mean that. I'm not just saying it to be saying it. I really appreciate you bringing your passion, bringing your energy, bringing your information to these meetings because it helps make us be better. And so thank you to you as well. And with that being said, there's nothing else. I believe that this meeting is adjourned. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm taking it back because it's administrator day and I want to say thank you to Kiera for being our administrator. I didn't say that out loud.
