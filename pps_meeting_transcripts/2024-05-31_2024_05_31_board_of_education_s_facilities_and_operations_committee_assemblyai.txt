A: All right. Good afternoon, everyone. We're going to commence the meeting of. I don't know if commence was the right word. We're going to start the meeting of the Facilities and Operations Committee today. We've got a couple folks that we're waiting on, so hopefully they'll chime in as they trickle in. All right, so we got a couple things on the agenda. We have our Grant bowl and we have the bond, which I see is even bigger, which I like. We getting closer to that 5 bill? I told you, we're getting closer, getting closer today. So we will let Mr. Dan Young start it off.

B: I'll go ahead and jump right in. Good evening. So the first topic will be the Granville Phase 2 lights and improvements. So I'm just going to do a quick intro and then we'll get into questions and I know there's public comment as well. Materials wise, you should have a copy of the staff report. Grantville. Phase two consists of improvements, including grandstands, lights and concessions. Phase two was a topic at the January 24 and February 28 F&O committee meetings. And during these meetings the concept of proceeding with a lights only option was discussed. Staff have put together a rough cost estimate and schedule for a lights only option that is in the staff memo. The total cost is approximately approximately $830,000 and would require a type 3 land use in addition to design, permitting, procurement of the design team and contractor and construction phases. More details, more details about the schedule are also in the memo. Staff's recommendation remains the same from the previous meetings. PPS's budget for FY24 25 includes approximately 3 million in unrestricted capital funding after deducting costs such as multi year project expenses, staff salaries and debt payment. That leaves somewhere between a million and a half to $2 million for all unrestricted capital needs next year. I'm not sure exactly how much we spent in emergency declarations, but it's probably close to that. Just emergency declarations alone this year. And we also have a long list of projects that are awaiting resources, both funding resources and human resources. We only have seven project managers, non bond project managers managing roughly 100 active projects right now. Some sample projects that are awaiting resources include sewer replacements, building structure repair, water damage and fire alarm replacements. Due to the considerable deferred maintenance needs and limited funds to address them, staff recommends that all available unrestricted capital funds be allocated to high priority deferred maintenance projects and new project scopes be considered as part of future bond funding. And with that we'll take Any questions or if you want to move to public comment?

C: All right, well, do I have to state my name or anything? I guess you guys know who I am. So, first of all, we're really excited to see that the estimate is a lot more in line with what we thought and hoped that it would be. So we really appreciate staff pulling that together. So thank you. So we're here today. There are more of us to ask. Sorry. I'm never nervous. I'm kind of nervous. We're here today to ask if for you to consider drafting and passing a resolution to direct staff to separate lights again from the Grant bowl master plan and initiate the type 3 land use review for installation of lights at the Grant Bowl. We've met separately with both Director Hollins and with Dan and your team over the last two months, and our ask was, and still is to support initiating this really important land use review. We've gathered nearly 2,000 survey responses that we've submitted to you since the turf failed. And nearly all support lighting and the Granville master plan. I can wait for a moment. That's okay. Reclaiming my time. So, anyway, we need to extend the hours of our field and separate the lighting from the plan. We can talk about lights all we want, but it's a moot point without the permit or approval. We don't know if the city is going to approve it. We need to open up that process. Obviously, we have neighbors here. Like, we need to start having this conversation in a public forum where it counts. We've asked the city to waive the fees that are associated with the land use review so we can take that cost out of the equation to celebrate our centennial year at Grant. And they're considering it and we're waiting on the response. They're trying to get a number right now. So in our meeting, Director Hollins, on April 1st, you mentioned that if we fundraise that you'll support the installation of lights. So now that we have an estimate that we think is pretty solid, we would like to take you up on that offer. And we're willing to raise the funds for the lights if PPS will initiate the permitting process. So we didn't. We don't. We don't want to pay internal staff costs, but lights electric. You know what that number is? I think we're close enough to the ballpark that were willing to do it and can I go a little bit? Since I waited. Okay, so we're here to. We're here to share that. And we also started reviewing OSAA game schedules for 2022, which is the last kind of normal year. And on the east side, the lack of fields has had a significant and disproportionate impact, not only in Grant, but on Benson students. We were actually really surprised, shocked at how far we all travel. Ranges from 16 to 26 miles round trip for a typical home game. Between Delta, between Columbia. God, where else are they going? There's Woodstock. Like it's. It's crazy and unnecessary. So we're working on consolidating all of those missed hours because as we were looking at it, we realized that there is a real possibility, we are not sure that this situation may be setting student athletes up for not meeting mandated instructional hours because they're leaving early. It's such a significant amount of time between. We're adding it up, so that's on our radar. And lastly, installation of lights at the bowl. It's an income generator. Park's made over $300,000 in the last 10 years for permitting fees. We won't have to pay bus costs. That's 67 buses for one football game. Because the band is really large. And I said 627, not 67. So anyway, so with the obstacle of cost largely removed and us taking the lead on the funding for the lights, we're asking you to initiate the land use review so we can engage the community and work on the future of the Grant Bowl.

end time: 143:12:54.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Yeah. To submit the land use. We have to prepare the land use application and do all the preempt requirements, which requires a partial design. So we would need to bring on the design team, at least to bring them to prepare the design and the land use application package to submit with the fees, if the fees will be put up so it becomes cheaper. So that would be the expense, majority of the expense to proceed with just the land use portion.

start time: 143:14:22.000

B: That would be total costs, you know, somewhere in the ballpark of $100,000. It certainly could be cheaper than that, but also could be more expensive between different situations where we have. Where the city has a lot of requirements as far as design or if we get into an appeal situation. Correct. So there's the design and professional services. So a part of that would be needed to prepare the materials and then the fees would be in that other line, another $100,000.

F: All right, so Stephanie Antipov, thanks for taking the time and opportunity to speak tonight. Currently, student athletes are missing a significant class time due to the early departures for practices and home games. This issue is particularly detrimental to some of our most fragile students who need every possible moment in the classroom to stay on track and successfully graduate. But sports are what's keeping them in school. To be honest, missing class not only hinders their academic progress, but also sends a concerning message that academics take a back seat to extracurricular activities. We are seeing student athlete families having to make tough decisions to leave Grant because the negative impact on their athletes grades. These students are missing the same class the entire season, missing last period for daily practices and home games, which is entirely avoidable. Last fall we saw a significant amount of students take failing grades because the work to catch up was overwhelming. Some decided since they were already going to fail, they skipped the period entirely for the whole semester. This significantly increased their absence rate and the need for credit recovery in the summer. With the declining attendance and student enrollment in PPS is currently experiencing, keeping kids in class should be top priority. Approving this resolution is a simple low hanging fruit that can significantly improve student retention and academic performance. The group here advocating for students is here to support this district. We are not just here to demand things be done. We're offering what to do. We are offering to do whatever it takes to keep kids in the classroom per the board's recommendation to fundraise. If that's what it takes, we will do it 100%. We are partners at this table, but we can't do any of those things until the district takes the first step to start the design and permitting process. By starting the permitting process, we're one step closer to being able to shift practices and games to later in the day, ensuring that our students remain in class during crucial instructional hours. This initiative is more than just sports. It's about showing our commitment to the education and well being of students.

G: Hello everybody. My name is Trent Carpenter. I'm a parent to Two boys at Beverly Cleary. One will be going to seventh, eighth grader and one will be going to Grant next year. I live about three blocks from Grant High School, Grant Bowl. I was the president of the Grant youth football organization last two years. My role as a youth football president, one of it was primary goal was to increase the participation in the numbers and encourage kids to continue with going on to Grant High School. The Grant youth football program was it consists of economically and racially diverse group of kids. About a third of the kids are on free and reduced lunches. We practice at Fern Hill which is not in our district and we did not play any games at home in the bowl last year. We were hoping to at least get one day a week in 8th grade team practice there just to have some continuity around Grant and around the team. Once we saw the scheduling without any lights, I mean that's just. There's no way we could ever get on to that field during the season. We would also promote going to the Friday night Grant varsity football games, even coordinated rides with the kids. We got over 80 kids in the program. But with these home games being at Marshall, typically around the track you'd see maybe 8 to 10 of the youth there, which was kind of discouraging because why is that important? One of the issues is, you know, we have a lot of these 8th grade football players that don't continue on to get go to Granite. I mean they go to Central Catholic or they just, they don't, they don't play football anymore. So we're missing that sense of community. And speaking specifically with football, it kind of feels like we're hiding this sport and it could really benefit a lot of kids that need it with these lights. So I'm asking that we do move forward with this permitting process of the lights. Lastly, I would like to mention I bought my house 2011. I knew very clearly what I was purchasing and where living near high school and I love the fact I'm near high school, that there's going to be some minor inconveniences here and there with events and things like that. That's part of it and that's part of the community. So I certainly am a neighbor there and I'm looking forward to more activities there. Good timing.

D: I'm going to speak for Moreau. Okay. Hello, my name is Moreau and I'm a parent of a student athlete at Grant in a Grant park and a Grant park neighborhood association board member. Since I was diagnosed with a terminal disease I have learned to reflect on the lessons I was given in life and prioritize what's important for my own children. I grew up a student athlete. I remember the pride I had competing for my school and community. The most important lessons I learned were not how to kick a ball harder or shoot better. I learned how to be part of something bigger than myself. I learned to win, to lose and still persevere. I learned many of my greatest lessons I've carried into adulthood from my time in high school sports, representing my community. I have pledged to see my daughter afford the same things, something every student has earned. I will see her play under the lights at the Grant bowl before she leaves school in two years because that should be her right as a Grant student athlete. And I will always fight for that. I want her to feel that same sense of pride I still carry with me today. It is time to get this done. Colin is reading my comments because my disease hinders my speech and I feel like this message needs to be clear. Thank you for supporting our students and our community in making this happen. And then if we could reset it because I have something to say as well.

D: My name is Colin McLean, born and raised in Northeast Portland, Grant alumni, class of 97 and current soccer coach for the Grant boys team. I want to start off by thanking the board and the F and O team for installing the new turf field and securing the lease. This is very much appreciated. Our job at Grant is not entirely done though because we still can't play home games since we don't have lights. Boys soccer, girls soccer and football still have to play their home games at Delta park or Marshall High School. Continuing the long standing history of leaving school early to get to Delta park and trying to make up for lost class time on their own. Playing our home games at Delta park during the day also means ida B. Wells, McDaniel, Benson, Cleveland, Roosevelt, Franklin and Lincoln all have to leave school early too. Installing lights in the Grant bowl benefits not only Grant student athletes, but the rest of the high schools in Portland. We all know how hard Covid was on our students. And then the recent teacher strike. Accepting the status quo of no lights and having our student athletes miss the same class over and over continues to be a burden for our student athletes. The mental fatigue, stress and exhaustion is not healthy. I know PPS is not in the business of encouraging students to miss class. We have to make this change now. Please begin the land use permitting process.

H: Hello, my name is Megan Steele. I support lighting the Grant bowl because it's a shame students need to miss class to go off site for sports practice. However, I do not support the lighting plan before you today, nor do I support separating out the land, the lighting from the rest of the Garant Pole planning process. It would be fiscally irresponsible, controversial and strategically unwise. Funding this plan would be fiscally irresponsible because you have heard it uses funds needed for higher priority problems in existing facilities. Even if there's private fundraising for the improvements, staff need to be working on higher priority issues. And because this particular lighting plan is unnecessarily expensive, the cost of this lighting plan is extra high. Because it's designed to support the Grant bowl master plan and a 1,500 seat stadium, less expensive lighting could be installed for student needs. This lighting plan is already stimulating controversy. Grant park is a treasured, highly utilized community resource that is presently enjoyed by people of all ages. It's a beautiful thing to see. A fenced stadium built for large events would bring parking, noise and congestion and shut the public out. The master plan is inherently controversial and inevitably will be opposed. It isn't a good idea for the district to invite criticisms of fiscal irresponsibility just as you are preparing to ask the public to approve another bond measure. I was instrumental in working to support the first teacher levy and set up school foundations and chaired site councils. I believe in public education. Grant has been a public park and people moved into the neighborhood knowing it.

The public will support field lighting for student practices if you work with neighbors to understand their concerns and agree to reasonable operating limits.

B: I'm going to ask Joanna Evenson, her senior project manager, if she knows offhand right they'll give the answer that you're. I think the. I don't want to shoot from him, but I think the bulk of that estimate is the design and then preparing.

start time: 360:33:20.000
end time: 367:03:04.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I mean, yeah, it's a good question. Our teams are very busy and something that we definitely don't want to do is when there are. We have a hard time with having enough funding resources and people resources. But when someone brings a project that has funding, we really try to prioritize managing that so we don't become the hurdle that doesn't get that project.

I: And just the type of lighting. My understanding was this estimate and just this is response to the last public comment. My understanding is the lights that were being installed aren't something specific so that we can have the grant master plan, but more the. The basic. The basic lighting that you'd have for also so that it's focused on the field not having a bunch of diffuse lights. But it's. So that was my impression that it wasn't some super deluxe but like pretty much the standard that we standard with our specs.

I can't remember how the lease actually works, but is it contemplated that there would be. My understanding is that most of the time would be used and I thought all the time just knowing how limited the field amount the night lighting would be just for Grant or is it contemplated that it's beyond that?

Is it because we don't want the lights or is it because we don't want the fence or is it both? You feel free to stand up and say something. I'm speaking directly to. I think the. So I. If I'm and I don't, I apologize. I guess what I'm trying to get to is from your perspective, the community is wanting it to be open for community use. You're not opposed to students having a place to have their home games and have lights for their games, which is what I'm hearing that they're asking for. Your concern is beyond the student use?

end time: 501:39:20.000

A: So. So the main thing with redundancy is being the design piece because you're designing something bigger anyway. But the placement of the lights pretty much get probably pretty much will stay.

confidence: 0.95
I: So from my perspective, I don't see this as a go around to the community to get to the stadium, but I think it's in response to a real need. So in 2003 or 4, I was part of the group that got Lighting at Roosevelt, Marshall and Cleveland. And it was transformative for those communities and the students, athletes. And I'll just say my daughter happened to 10 years later go to Cleveland and was a student athlete. And even then, I mean they're somewhat like Grant in a very confined footprint. And so you've got a lot of just school activity in one confined place. And having lights meant that fewer students had to leave campus for practices. There was still a lot of juggling and going to practice, sometimes at 7:30 at night. But it did give the student athletes a lot more time. So I very much view this as a, that was 20 years ago when those other communities receive those the lights and expansion of the capability for students to practice. And so for me I view this as a separate thing, although some redundancies, but doesn't sound like a lot. I would be inclined if the, and this is I think a conversation outside of this, outside of this meeting for the grant community to talk to district staff about whether we have the capability to fund the sort of the design work. And then Dan, giving an estimate about whether that is something that your staff has the capacity to do. As you said, if you have the money, they try and make things work. And also being informed by the answer about whether what the expectations are about whether this is for student athletes versus the broader community. I mean just knowing, having looked at those charts about usage of fields, I don't see there being a lot of time that you'd have for student athletes wouldn't be the primary users of that. I'd be fine for us to be supportive of moving ahead with some conditions.

A: Yeah, I think I, you know, I'm gonna kind of use the same analogy that we're using with avt. Right. If it's a zero sum, zero cost to us, you know, at least start that process. But I want to make sure I'm clear it would have to be a zero sum to the district as we are having a district. Okay, just make sure I'm clear on that. Okay. Okay. And so I don't know if it has to be some kind of agreement made or whatever around that, but I'll be okay with at least moving forward with the permitting piece knowing that it's not going to cost the district to do that.

B: Okay. Next item is update on general obligation bond planning. I have a present. Oh, here we go. Roseanne's where you are. Roseanne. Oh, never mind. I found it. Okay, I think we're up and running. So materials you should have in your packets is a copy of the presentation, the conceptual bond, budget worksheet, and then three staff memos. One on pe, one on athletics, one on curriculum. The material here is pretty content rich. That said, we've covered a lot of it before, so I'm going to go through quickly. Stop me if you have questions. That's what we're going to do. So this slide is just kind of a quick resource to previous materials that we've covered to date. If it's helpful, some high level takeaways from our previous conversations. Pursue a larger bond, principal amount. Continue prioritizing the modernization projects. Allocate significant funds to existing facilities. Proceed with the planned technology improvements and retain the existing living rate. The current option meets all of those. So we're in line. This just shows the progression over time. We looked at a couple of variables, different scenarios back in January, and gradually that total amount has increased as we have continued to review options. The intent tonight isn't to go over every one of the scopes in detail, but really focus on the ones that have materially changed since our last meeting. Ostensibly athletics, physical education and curriculum. Quick update on schedule. We spend somewhere between $150 and $250 million a year in capital. Some years we spend less, some years we spend more. Depends on what those projects are using that range. With $2.7 billion plus existing bond funds, our estimate to complete that work would be somewhere between 15 and 20, 22 years. Somewhere in that range, deferred maintenance. So we're jumping to the scopes of work. This has not changed. As we've discussed before, PPS has very big deferred maintenance needs. And although 400 million doesn't address all the needs, it is a very significant investment and would improve schools throughout the district. There's more details on deferred maintenance in those two reference staff memos.

B: Yes.

end time: 683:34:10.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Is there time and space in that 24 years where we can. I remember, I want to make sure I understand it. We can still go out for a smaller bond within that 24 years.

start time: 683:52:30.000
end time: 693:52:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: You can always go out for another bond if you increase the levy rate to go out for another bond in that time. Depends on how you structure the debt. When you sell the bonds, because we don't sell them all at once. Gives us authority to sell. We sell them in chunks. And we don't have to make that decision of what that looks like now, especially when it's long term. It can be like sell that first tranche and then we can reevaluate as we go along. Does that answer? Yeah, lots of variables, I guess. Yeah.

start time: 693:52:00.000
end time: 695:46:20.000
confidence: 0.87
A: I just want to make sure it doesn't preclude. It'll preclude us from doing it again just in case something comes up. Strategy changes. Okay.

start time: 696:40:00.000
end time: 712:14:16.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Priority upgrades. So this is new. There are a number of facility scopes of work that do not fall under deferred maintenance. They're not something broken that needs to be fixed. Examples are like security upgrades, seismic and ada. At the last meeting there was some fairly brief conversation about those scopes of work. Didn't have any specific allocated funds. Was there a way to put something towards them so that they didn't have nothing? And so what we were proposing here Is to put $50 million towards that group of projects where it wouldn't be towards preferred maintenance, it'd be other improvements, things like security improvements. And what we propose is to allocate a dollar amount and then have a ladder process to identify exactly what those highest priorities are. That also give the new superintendent trying to get away with what they think their highest needs are. And that could be ada, it could be, you know, sped classroom improvements. It could be a lot of things. So that's what this is proposed.

start time: 712:16:08.000
end time: 715:01:44.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So that's like almost, almost like a flex fund for. So any parties a new superintendent has throughout this time, we can flex those funds for that.

start time: 715:03:12.000
end time: 769:38:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: That is the idea. Okay, is that going to be enough? Like I'm curious about like how many. What percentage of our schools need seismic upgrades and are the. I guess, well, I guess it seems you're pursuing seismic grants. Right. So are there plentiful enough grants to. No seismic. Very few of our current buildings meet current seismic. We'll get seismic code changes, probably just a handful of them meet current code. Seismic itself. It's such a large scope of work. We don't have a good number, but certainly well over a billion dollars to try and upgrade all schools to current seismic code. We do pursue grants often and we've won shoot from the hip, seven, eight, maybe nine seismic grants in the last 10 years. Those virtually always require matching funds. So what we've done before when we've had seismic Funds is we can go for grant. The state grant caps out. I think it's $2.5 million. A project might be to fully retrofit the building, say $7 billion. So we'll put in four and a half to get that. Two and a half. We've been very successful with that. So that's an example of what we might prioritize with this slides Athletics. I want to. There's where I want to point to the staff memo on athletics. In previous meetings, we discussed options for athletic improvements. And we had an option that was roughly $150 million. That number has been updated a little bit. But the scope of that was the three high school athletic hubs plus four middle schools. Athletic needs are, of course, greater than just that. And I think it was the March meeting, if I remember right, that director Grim Edwards offered an alternative list of options. And if you look at that memo, which I will try and find, there's a table attached that looks like this. And I'll just talk through the columns real quick. So the first column with dollar amounts, and it is the total estimate for each one of those schools. That scope of work. So a menu of all of those. That total is a little over 300 million. Sorry, there's a memo that's PIL. Yes, it's the appendix. So it'll be the second column that says staff memo March 2024. Is that scope I just mentioned with the three athletic hubs plus four middle schools. The next column, conceptual PIL investments board list. That was director Edwards list. And what that totals out. And so there's different scope than the previous. And then in conversations with our PIL team, noted high priorities as well, which largely matches the previous column. So the question for the committee is the 2.7 includes that smaller dollar amount just being consistent with that previous scope. But the question is to the committee, what is that right scope of work? That should be in the total bond principle. It sounds like Marshall did make it today, so if he wants to come down and chat, he can do that, too.

A: Fair enough. I have one question. I'm gonna try to see if I can state this right. If there was a potential private public partnership, where would those funds come from?

start time: 778:30:20.000
end time: 787:58:54.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I don't know if I know the answer to that. I'm not hedging. I'm just trying to think of if there's significant capital comes from the district, it comes from the bond. There really isn't other options. There could be some creative options. It's probably the structure of that partnership to know if bond funds are eligible, I guess is where my hedge comes from. I just don't know that answer. I need others to help me answer the question.

start time: 788:00:22.000
end time: 788:54:50.000

end time: 796:56:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Far as with the hubs, as far as transportation. Right. So I've been hearing from like Grant, I know, Benson, I'm sure, like our middle schools, how will the transportation to these hubs and from these hubs be done? And also with our declining funding, is that something that could be stagnated because of the funding that. The funding cuts that we might end up having to take over the next few years?

start time: 797:57:10.000
end time: 798:19:42.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Yeah, I'll let you do that.

start time: 798:22:46.000
end time: 819:23:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Well, a couple parts of that. So first part about the hubs and access. So currently, if we're going to Delta park to go to Whitaker or Jackson or somewhere, it'll be a whole lot closer for all the teams to get there. Right. So that's. And we do those primarily for games. Practices are primarily in parks that are adjacent to our communities. So I don't. Will transportation go up a little bit? Yes, but not significantly because it'll be the. The savings from not going to Delta but you'll go to Jackson. If you're at Wiki or somewhere close to the neighborhood or if you're in Cleveland, you can go to Marshall rather than going to Delta Park. In terms of the other part of transportation related to our cuts, I would hope that we would prioritize athletics as the grant committee talked about the importance that we would not make cuts. But I think we do have a plan, or we began to plan what we think our cuts will potentially be in the future, whether it's a 5, 10, 15% potential cut for athletics and that we would not cut transportation because we still need transportation to get to where we're going. So that would still be a high priority for us.

start time: 819:33:40.000
end time: 825:00:02.000
confidence: 0.92
A: And then with the new schools models, for instance, like we're doing the grant phase two and we're doing the Cleveland and they're in that phase, they're talking about doing sports there too. Will the hubs be still that needed if those schools are having those things done?

start time: 825:03:06.000
end time: 831:58:16.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Well, yes, because the perception is that the hubs is replacing the need for all athletics at a particular school. So let's take Grant, for example. So, yes, we should have lights. Yes, it's important to have lights. We still are going to need to have. They have four soccer teams on the boys and four on the girls. If you add lights, you just added two practice slots after football practice.

B: Is over.

start time: 832:14:08.000
end time: 842:05:20.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Whereas those other three teams of boys and three teams of girls going to go, they're still in need. The need is great. Right now we're using Park Bureau. We're hoping to lessen our dependency on Park Bureau, but also Park Bureau. We're contingent on weather and contingent on their them allowing us to use the facility as they're competing with the general public for those same facilities. So this gives us ownership, access and more importantly, it gives all of our kids equitable opportunity to participate in top notch facilities.

start time: 842:13:40.000
end time: 843:46:40.000
confidence: 0.95
A: What is our cost that we spend on parks for athletics?

start time: 845:16:30.000
end time: 846:00:54.000
confidence: 0.80
B: I don't know that offhand.

start time: 846:03:02.000
end time: 863:57:52.000
confidence: 0.93
E: I think it's an exchange in that we, they use our gyms, we use their fills, technically their fills and their golf courses and the swimming pools. It's an exchange. We kind of go round around about getting the best benefit of that. But we kind of exchanged that we don't have enough in either direction. We're not, I don't think either group is happy in terms of the amount that we need. There's not enough need for everyone, especially to fit in the hours. Right. So we're saying we want our kids to be home at 8:00, for example. There's very limited options where we can be done at 8 o'clock. If you're saying we can sell to 10 or 11, which Lincoln actually had to do when we share with, with Wells, then we could, we can make it work. But if we're trying to be home at 7:30, 8:00, we need, we, we need more. And in our current Park Bureau agreement, we're done at 7 o'clock. We have to be done by 7 and that was just increased to 7 this year.

end time: 880:10:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So I just want to make sure I understand. So when we're talking about the cost, right, because I'm looking at our budget stuff and the enrollment that is estimated over the next 10 years. So we are one to invest, which I'm all for athletics, invest in a lot of these costs giving us, well, going from us having to pay zero because it's a partnership piece to whatever the additional maintenance cost is going to be with the declining enrollment that is estimated and the budget cuts or the lack of funding that we've been receiving. If it goes the way it's going, we're going to have another $30 million cuts next year. And then with the new biennium, if they don't do anything, we'll probably be looking at Another hundred and some million dollar cuts. Will this be sustainable?

start time: 880:25:10.000
end time: 901:18:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Well, I don't project that. If we have less enrollment, we're still not going to have enough kids to offer the current sports we offer. I mean, we have 11,000 high school students and we have about 5500 that do sports. So if you still lost 2000. I'm not Jessica. If you lost 2000 kids, it probably won't be the 5500 that are doing sports because as you are, that's part of why they come to school. So the question will be, will we want to make an investment in those kids and maintain those programs. So for example, when we looked at doing potential cuts in athletics this year, there's some low hanging fruit we can cut. We can cut cheerleading, we can cut freshman sports. But if you cut those things, you're also telling kids you don't value them and the things they're interested in. So we kept them. We cut other places as we look for athletics. As I said, we have a plan where we're looking at what would be the potential cuts. I'd imagine if we cut 30 million out of PPS, you're not going to come to athletics and say give us 10, you're going to say give us some percentage of that and we're prepared to make that adjustment to ensure that we provide the same opportunities we're providing the kids today.

I: I actually have, okay, a couple things to say, comments because I think they need to be said now. So a couple things I'm noticing in the scope of work, the center for native students isn't included. And if we're going to have some sort of criteria of how you get on the list, I'd like to know what it is. This isn't a criticism of staff. It's just I've raised it a couple times. If we have some criteria, it would be good to know because I feel really strongly about that. Second, we need to have an extended board discussion about the bond and the timing. Frankly, I don't see this, it being possible for us to go in November. This is a massive package. We've never passed anything like that before. It's for 24 years. In the local option campaign, we ended with zero left in. There was very limited fundraising that was done and the fundraising were done covered the expenditures for the barely for the campaign.

I: It'S the same packet count. So we're starting from zero. This will be a much more expensive campaign. It will require a huge board effort because once it gets referred, it's on the board on raising the money. Community building also, it's going to be very important that we actually do polling or surveying on the size, the scope, the timing and the components before we go out for the bond. And my recommendation is that we would plan that out and then do that in the next couple weeks. And I anticipate that there'll be two pieces, one that will inform the package. We also traditionally have had community engagement and this is how we built support for the bond versus the local option is that we've had a community group that has worked on the bond package to advise the district and the board. And so that. That would be another piece. And I just look at the referral dates for this fall and they would be very aggressive and I don't see that currently the board having the capacity in addition to having a new superintendent. So I, I would recommend that we some polling and that we also set up a longer meeting for the board to talk about the timeline for the referral and what we need to do to support staff. So those are my comments. And I also really want to have a longer, deeper dive on the curriculum piece at some point because it was 50 million in the last bond to get us all subjects.

I: All subjects, all grades and to go from 50 million to 334. And I know it sounds like it's two curriculum cycles, but that's still. That's going from 100 million to. It's another 250 almost on top of that. So those are my questions. But I think we have a lot more work to do. I don't think we're ready to go in November and we should build a plan. It's going to be a lot harder than the local option because the local option is sort of like absolutely critical that we do. And the bond by a lot of people is viewed as a more nice to have.

A: I get that. And we are almost out of time. I will get with Dan to look at some times to do a full board effective session around this as well. I do want to say though, this is this actually what came up last year when we talked about putting a levy and the bond in the same year and you were like, yeah, it'll be fine. When we talked about this last year, it is fine.

I: And I saw the performance of what the board did on the local option and in terms of the fundraising and the community, like going out in a meeting with the community and building support for It. Yeah. And that we would have to have a much different effort from the board.

I: Well, people would have to commit to. Like, if you've got fundraising calls to make, to make. When I made that comment, it's like, yes, you can do it. But I was also expecting that all board members would follow through and make fundraising calls, and that didn't necessarily. Didn't happen. The other thing is.

I: So the other thing that needs to happen is when I said that it's also predicated on how we've done every bond package, which is we have to talk to the voters about what they want in the package. It's very easy to say, do you want 650 teachers? And people are like, yes, sign me up for that. A bond package has a lot of different components that people have different varying willingness to pay. And we have to test what people are willing to buy and have.

A: All right, so I get with Dan. We set up a meeting sometime after we get done with the superintendent search stuff, which hopefully will be Saturday. And then we forgot a time to get all that stuff together. All right, Any other questions, comments, thoughts? All right, Meeting the turn. Thank you.
