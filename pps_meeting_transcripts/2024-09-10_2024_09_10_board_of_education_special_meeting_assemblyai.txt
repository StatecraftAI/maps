A: All right. The special meeting of the Board of education for September 10, 2024 is called to order. All items being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the board and meetings tab. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. Good evening and welcome. Tonight we are being asked to consider the dismissal of a contract educator, Mr. Nathaniel Williams. Employee discipline matters are confidential under state law unless the employee requests the matter to be considered publicly which Mr. Williams has requested. In addition, Mr. Williams was entitled to the pre determination hearing under PPS policy. That nearly two hour hearing involved hundreds of documents was held on August 29th before hearing officer and the board has received a recording of that hearing and support documents. Mr. Williams and PPS have agreed that the recording of the hearing and the evidence discussed will be available to the public. After considering the evidence including over a thousand pages of documents, the hearing officer found that the district established that Mr. Williams actions constitute insubordination, neglect of duty, immorality, physical or mental incapacity and inadequate performance. All statutory grounds for for dismissal per ORS 342.865. Her findings and conclusions, the documents offered by both sides and the hearing itself are all before the board for consideration. Before we move to a vote, Mr. Williams has requested to address the board followed by three public commenters related to the board vote. Let's begin by getting the motion on the table. Do I have a motion a second to adopt Resolution 6961, dismissal of a contract teacher Motion.

D: Good evening everyone. I'm here to express my profound concerns about the district's handling of my situation, particularly regarding the false statements made against me and the emotional and psychological damage that has resulted. While the district expects teachers to implement restorative practices in the classroom, my experience highlights troubling disconnect between these ideals and actions taken by the administration. On August 25, 2023, following the sharing of restorative practices with my colleagues, I was summoned to the office and subjected to questioning by Sarah Fitch. She informed me that I was at risk of losing my job if I didn't take a drug test. During our discussion, I told her I had been prescribed two medications and that I was now only taking one. She then asked if I could provide her with the prescription. I said yes and showed her my prescription. However, when she requested to take notes, I did allow her to take the notes, but she wanted to take photos and I declined her to take photos. But after further discussion, I asked her why I had to take a drug test, to which she responded, because we don't want people in front of our kids who do drugs. Despite any lack of reasonable suspicion that I was under the influence of illegal drugs, I have been falsely accused of being under the influence of meth. I did not take method. I took Adderall, a medication that was prescribed for me by my doctor for my adhd. Adderall is very similar to meth in its chemistry, but it also has the same intoxicating effects. Sorry, it does not have the same intoxicating effects. The accusations that I use illegal drugs is not only untrue, but also deeply damaging to my reputation and my mental well being. The decision to place me on leave and now to terminate me has compounded the emotional and psychological damage I have experienced throughout this entire process. The district's actions have felt more like a witch hunt than a fair investigation. Instead of prioritizing the best interest of students and supporting its teachers, the administration has resorted to punitive measures that that undermines the very principles it professes to uphold. It is crucial to understand that the damage caused by these actions will take significant time and effort to undo. The investigation has lacked integrity. Included. False.

E: I'm going to pick up where Mr. William stepped off. Included false statements, misleading information that appears to have been used to persuade your decision. Today, I urge the district to reflect on its commitment to supporting educators and consider the implications of its actions on my mental health and professional standing. I am before you today to ask you for one thing. Do not fire me. Do not fire me because it will harm me, it will harm students. It will harm the Fabian community and the entire district. And after you look at the actual evidence and see the reality of this situation, I hope you agree. I did not use method, but I am a black man in Portland and I had the courage to get medical help for my own mental health needs. And then I had the very bad luck to be prescribed medication that is chemically similar to meth and that can't be distinguished from meth on a drug test. I did everything the district asked to prove my innocence. I presented proof of my medication so many times, the district ignored it all. I hired a toxicologist to explain the chemistry. The district ignored it. I presented witness statements of people who said I was not intoxicated. The district ignored it. Everything I said and did was ignored because it didn't fit with the district's initial assumption that I was a drug user. That assumption is wrong. Look at the facts and believe me. Believe in what I have done for our students. Believe in what others say about me, what students say. Because I know the truth about what happened. And I think you know the truth, too, and I am confident that you have the courage to act on it. Thank you for your time and your patience. I would like to make some comments as well. This is on behalf of Portland association of teachers and Mr. Williams. In our view, this case is about stereotypes and assumptions and how once they take hold, no amount of evidence can defeat them. And how, sadly, PPS's human resources department has stubbornly refused to consider the actual facts in this case. That Mr. Williams is a black man who is brave. He is brave to take steps to treat his mental health needs, his adhd. He took his prescribed Adderall as required by his doctor. He came to work, performed his job without any signs of intoxication, and now he stands falsely accused of being a meth user, a liar and an unsafe teacher. And this is all fiction. And it's a fiction that's been repeated, reinforced and embellished, first by PPSHR staff Sarah Fitch, and then by others who relied on her original work. And it's repeated now so often that PPS cannot see it for what it is. And in spite of this campaign, the smear campaign, Mr. Williams has remained calm and put his faith in the facts and his trust that the district would eventually come to its senses. He has disproved the allegations again and again, using documents, logic, calling out racism and disability, discrimination, all of which led us to this point. But once PPS made up its mind, it appeared that nothing could stop it, not even the actual facts. And here I want to show you the fiction and the facts behind it. So let's talk about the actual facts. Mr. Williams did not use methamphetamines. He has ADHD. He was prescribed by his doctor two separate medications to treat that condition. One is Wellbutrin and the other one is Adderall. Both Wellbutrin and Adderall have been shown to demonstrate false positives on tests for methamphetamine. But Mr. Williams did not know that in the summer of 2023, he was in a child custody dispute. He was required to take a drug test by the court. And because he was ashamed of his mental health diagnosis, he didn't disclose that he was taking medication for adhd. When he went in to take that drug test, he didn't think it was necessary to disclose it. He also didn't have a lawyer to help him in that case. And like so many people interacting with the legal system without help, he was not able to explain his situation clearly to the court when the drug test came back positive and the court incorrectly concluded that he was using drugs. And he's in the process of appealing that decision. But now let's get to the fictions that PPS has adopted and the facts behind them. So the first fiction is that PPS now claims on August 24, the day before the test in question, they claim that he told his co worker, Damon Miller that he had, quote, screwed up recently and failed a drug test after attending a festival in Astoria. This is a false description of the conversation between Mr. Williams and Mr. Miller. It derives from a two line note that's undated and unattributed in the HR file. But we know that it was written by Ms. Fitch. And you will hear from Mr. Williams, perhaps even Mr. Miller and others, that that's not what Mr. Williams said. And how do we know this? Because there's an email exchange after this point between Ms. Fitch and Carmen Williams, the principal at Mr. Williams School, and Ms. Fitch attempts to verify that her note is accurate. And Principal Williams says it is not accurate. She says, quote, and this is on August 29th. I don't believe the screwed up piece tied directly to the test, but to the overall situation. In fact, what Mr. Williams had told Damon Miller was that he had screwed up by not disclosing his ADHD medication at the time of the test. But did Ms. Fitch correct her statement in the HR file? No, she did not. And then PPS use that two line statement as one of the bases for its allegations against Mr. Williams.

E: Well, I appreciate your time limit, but that is a matter of dispute between the union and the district. We have not agreed to a 10 minute limitation. It violates the party's past practice and the policy. So if you insist on adhering to that restriction, I will honor that request. But it will be subject to legal challenge because this is not what we've agreed to. And it also would Be an unfair labor practice. We filed an unfair labor practice before on this very issue, which is the parties have reserved their positions on it. So I would request that you allow us to continue. There is a lot of information that you should hear.

E: All right, I'll continue. And it's still subject to challenge. So what's the next fiction that PPS claims that on August 25th Mr. Williams was intoxicated at Fabian Elementary School. What are the facts? Actually, he had taken his prescribed Adderall and was not intoxicated. How do we know that that's factual? Because John McGee, another teacher, indicated that Mr. Williams was calm, relaxed and professional and not intoxicated. Because Damon Miller, another colleague of Mr. Williams, said that he had never seen Mr. Williams intoxicated and that he actually gave. Mr. Williams gave a presentation to staff that day about restorative strategies and that Mr. Williams was professional and sober. We even know it from Principal Williams, Carmen Williams, who noted in her statements to HR that on that Friday the 25th, Mr. Williams was acting professionally and that he had mentioned that he had a recent change in his medications, which is exactly what happened. And we also know that there's no evidence, zero evidence from any of the scientific experts or any of the testimony at the pre termination hearing that Mr. Williams was intoxicated on that day. So that's false. And that is one of the allegations that the District relies on in its notice for termination. What's another fiction? PBS claims on August 25 that Mr. Williams showed Ms. Fitch a pill bottle with a torn label with a date missing and refused to provide his prescription information. This is all meant to paint him as deceptive. The facts? He showed his current Adderall bottle with an intact label showing that it was current. She copied down the information and he just asked that she not take a picture of it because it had his private medical information. What else? Fiction. PPS claims that he refused to share his prescription information with PPS after August 25th. There's no less than five different times when he shared that information. First, on September 13th he got his copies of his prescription. On September 18th, he sent those prints outs to the medical review officer, requested to receive that information by the district. On September 19, he sent additional paperwork on the 20th, Mr. Nguyen for Pat confirmed that he had complied with PPS request and submitted his medication. On September 26, he resubmitted his information to the medical Review office. On Oct. 3, Ms. Fitch said he still didn't have his information. Well, on October 4th, he resubmitted it again, both pictures of the bottle and the prescriptions. And on October 5, the medical review office confirmed receipt of those. Yet after all that, the notice of termination still claims that Mr. Williams failed to provide his prescription information to PPS. How can you look at those facts which are undisputed and say that the district is acting in good faith here? What else? Fiction. PPS claims that the results from Mr. Williams drug tests on the 25th proved he used illicit methamphetamines. There's no dispute that that's what the lab result was initially. But you know what? Adderall is a therapeutic form of amphetamines. And reputable labs like ohsu, for example, include a disclaimer on this test that says this test will produce results for urine specimens collected from patients. Will produce positive results for urine specimens collected from patients who are administered Adderall. This is science. This is ohsu. If they had received the test.

E: Yes, thank you. I have much more. But I will tell you that the four grounds for termination, the four statutory grounds relied on by the hearings officer, none of them valid. Insubordination. Mr. Williams, to be fired for insubordination, he would have to intentionally defy district directives. He didn't do that. There's no defiance. He did everything that they asked. Neglect of duty. In the case Crouch vs Springfield, this is a fair dismissal appeals board case 2018, that board found that a teacher who had used cocaine and then drove and got a DUI did not neglect duty.

E: Yes. Immorality again. In that same case, the board found no grounds for immorality when someone admitted to using off duty or illegal drugs off duty and got in a car and drove. Still no immorality and finally inadequate performance. It's not even a relevant charge. The fair dismissal of appeals ORD has cited on many times that that only is relevant for a violation or a failure in the technical aspects of teaching. It's a very specific charge for someone who's on a plan of assistance, who has poor Evaluations. We've cited these cases over and over and over, and yet the district moves forward. None of these grounds are valid. So you should think very carefully, please, about what is the fact and what is the fiction here. Mr. Williams has already issued a tor claims notice against the district. We have been exceedingly clear about the problems with this case over and over and over again, and it's your chance to fix this. Thank you.

B: Hello. I'd like to begin. My name is Damon Miller. I'm the restorative lead for Fabian KQ8. I've been there seven school. It's my seventh year coming in. I've known Mr. Williams for 21 years. I met him as I was an associate director for the Police Activities League pal, a local nonprofit in the city that was sponsored by the city and police. And him and I, well, we ran a sports league for football mentoring and coaching for over 3,500 kids every year. So this is undercity and Portland police best practices. Mr. Williams was considered a pillar of the north community. He was one of the only coaches that would sit kids that didn't academically meet his standards. I want to talk about the situation at hand. Let's look at our bias on how we look at black men and professionals. This is a case right here where things were charged and going too fast. And our basic pepper teaches us to slow down, slow down when we're looking at a person like this who has given up nothing but his time and effort to the community. And now he teaches, which is his passion. The things that were said about me, I'd like to say that I did not say them. I'd like to say that the time frame does not work. I'd also like to say that the things that were said about me that I said, I would have no way of knowing because I didn't speak to Mr. Williams until August 22nd. On August 24th, excuse me. Or the day of the training that his lawyer just spoke of. We had a Conversation about how we wanted to take the school over culturally, that he was ready and he was walked off shortly after giving a presentation. I've never known Mr. Williams in my 21 years of working with him, 16 where I was his director. For him to ever be under the influence or I've never seen him use drugs. This is something that easily could be said about a black man, a black professional. I want to point out race because I'm taught by PPS to look at things in a racial perspective. Let's take this black man's perspective and his experience and mine watching it. As a person who works at Fabian for seven years, I've seen and now I'm a restorative lead on a success advocate. I come to you as an advocate and a restorative person. I've seen my colleagues be giving grace. I've seen my colleagues be given a restorative avenue. I've seen my colleagues have union representation that wrapped around them, not excluded them. I'd like to also say that the work that we do, where we put ourselves here for pps, the skills that we have, is undeserving of this man. I also come to you non represented. I'm an out will employee for PPS that is and should tell you about this place pays my bills. It's my profession of 30 years. It's my passion. And I'm here standing next to him on something that I feel is unfair.

F: Okay. When I read all this, first I had no idea what color you were, by the way, until I came to the part that said you were saying that you thought it was based on color and why you were going against it. And it seemed to me in reading it that it started because of a court decision between you and your wife. Right. That there was some sort of a decision that you could not see your child. And then somehow they said you might have taken drugs. And that's when they talked to you at the school and asked for you to bring the prescriptions. And according to all the papers, you didn't bring the prescriptions. And then of course you're saying they did bring prescriptions. So how are we. I mean we've got did, didn't, did, didn't. And it's just very difficult to know who to believe. And also a lot of the information about the Adderall and what was the other drug, the one that didn't show it. Yeah. It seemed like they decided that the amounts that you had were more than you would get in the Adderall, that you would have to get it from somewhere else. And I know people's blood chemistry is different, so that's awfully hard to know what to do with. As well, we also had in the information complaints about interactions with students and what else?

end time: 435:04:30.000

E: Right? True. I'm not disputing that. But if you look at the 20 day notice which sets out the facts that are relied on, teaching issues are not among them.

end time: 455:10:22.000
confidence: 0.96
E: I need to address this because these are settlement discussions. They're privileged. But counsel for the district has decided that to breach that confidentiality and that privilege. The reason why Mr. Williams could not accept that is because he takes Adderall. And Adderall, the science shows, has small but significant impurities in it when it's created in the pharmaceutical process. And those show up as methamphetamine in a drug test. That's what the scientific research shows. So if he were to take the test today, it would come out the same way. So that's why he couldn't agree to those conditions, because it would be a setup for failure. If he could stop taking Adderall for his neurodiversity, he would, and he would gladly take the test, but he cannot. And therefore he cannot agree to that. So we offered a compromise, which was we would send the pill that he.

end time: 462:53:08.000

F: I just want to clarify. The settlement discussions are privileged when they're in the midst of litigation. We are not. And so they are not privileged settlement discussions. All I'm saying is what we're going on is what we read. That's all we had. Correct?

E: So I appreciate Director Sullivan's questions because there is a lot to look at here. But this is why I tried to go through the fact and the fiction. For example, good point you raised. Did he or did he not provide his prescription information to the district and the medical review officer? You have the documents? I can give you exhibit by exhibit to show you the five different times he provided those.
