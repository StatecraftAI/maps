A: Everyone, we're going to go ahead and get started. This public special meeting and board budget work session of the Board of education and the CBRC for March 19, 2024 is called to order. All items being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the board and meeting tabs. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. So please check the district website for any all the replay times. Welcome. We're here this evening to talk about the budget work session with the budget Review committee, Community Budget Review Committee, commonly referred to as the cbrc. Before moving into tonight's work, we do have two items to vote on this evening, our consent agenda and a resolution that authorizes the increased seating capacity of the Roosevelt grandstands and to complete the McDaniel field house. So we're going to start with the consent agenda. Board members, are there any items you would like to pull for discussions? We will set those aside to be on the regular agenda for the next board meeting. All right.

start time: 24:44:50.000

start time: 25:57:14.000
end time: 26:07:50.000
confidence: 0.84
C: No.

start time: 26:50:10.000
end time: 31:19:10.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Board members any already said that. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt the consent agenda? So second Director Scott moved and Director Bur Edwards seconds the adoption of the consent agenda. Is there any board discussion of the on the consent agenda?

start time: 31:39:10.000
end time: 36:59:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Just noting that we're approving five field trips. And I would ask, as I often do, whether there is value that the board members got out of approving these five field trips. Because again, I'll just remind everyone there's a tremendous amount of administrative work that goes into it, both from the school level and staff, to bring these things to us. So I can put that out there as policy.

start time: 37:17:50.000
end time: 43:23:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yes. And to that note, one of the reasons why I do like it on the considers, I think it's next month or the month next. I think it's next month. We're going to actually have those students come and present on their trips that they had. And had I not known that they were going on those trips, I wouldn't have been able to invite them to explain the trip. But I did that because I knew.

start time: 43:35:30.000
end time: 44:38:34.000
confidence: 0.92
B: With all due respect, those kids are going on field trips and we don't need to approve the field trips in.

start time: 44:38:42.000
end time: 44:51:22.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Order to invite them.

start time: 44:51:46.000
end time: 46:16:58.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I think inviting them makes a ton of sense. I will say in my five years, we've never once denied a field trip.

start time: 46:18:34.000
end time: 46:30:50.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Yeah.

start time: 46:33:30.000
end time: 47:10:42.000

confidence: 0.92
A: Gotcha. Thank you. All right. The board will now vote on Resolution 6876 through 6880 and 6882. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes.

start time: 51:34:42.000
end time: 51:41:22.000

confidence: 0.95
D: Yes.

start time: 53:57:40.000
end time: 59:35:56.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Are there any abstentions? And there'll be one for me. The consent agenda as amended have been approved by a vote of 6, 2, 1 with one extension with our student director. So if I'm voting yes, I think it's five.

start time: 59:37:08.000
end time: 59:47:20.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Zero.

start time: 59:57:40.000
end time: 85:12:00.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Oh, Herman's not here. Five to one. How does they all. One extension and our student rep. Student director set aside voting yes. All right. So next on the agenda is the resolution authorizing improvements to an appropriation for the Roosevelt grandstands and an appropriation for the McDaniel Field House. We're looking to add additional seating to the Roosevelt High School grandstands and the completion of the McDaniel Fieldhouse project in time for 2024 spring sports season. Resolution authorized expenditures of capital funds not to exceed 2.5 million to increase the capacity of the Roll of Oak grants stands by 1500 seats. Additional 800 seats for the visitors and the structure beneath the stands will be considered in the potential 2024 bond project for the McDaniel Field House project. The resolution authorize the expenditure of capital funds not to exceed 247,000 for a final construction and installation payment to be made immediately. This resolution was brought forward by Vice Chair Green and Director Bermuda and presented to the Facilities and Operations Committee where it was unanimously approved to be referred to the full board for consideration this evening. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt Resolution 6881?

start time: 85:44:30.000
end time: 85:55:18.000
confidence: 0.98
E: Second.

start time: 85:57:34.000
end time: 87:37:30.000
confidence: 0.78
A: Right. Director Burma Works. Move. Director Wong. Seconds. Is there any board discussion?

start time: 87:43:10.000
end time: 92:31:12.000
confidence: 0.92
B: I have some questions about this. The resolution doesn't know where the funding is coming from and I, I, I'll be honest. I actually only became aware of this issue when I just happened to come to the end of the last FO Committee meeting. Because I don't believe you. Before the words in any of the.

start time: 92:31:36.000
end time: 92:57:52.000
confidence: 0.57
D: Community updates we're made.

start time: 92:59:36.000
end time: 94:05:04.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So I just, I need a little more information on where the money's coming from.

start time: 94:06:32.000
end time: 100:15:44.000
confidence: 0.95
F: I have those exact same questions. I would like to know more, particularly when reading through the staff memo, it's not clear where the money's going to come from. So I don't think unless I, unless I miss that it's got a not to exceed price. But then we've got all these other, the other questions.

start time: 100:17:52.000
end time: 100:39:44.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Come up and answer that question.

start time: 100:41:12.000
end time: 110:02:50.000
confidence: 0.92
F: The. The long range facilities report calls out like all of our facilities need operating. And then there's an index that calls out priority and probably I guess there's no low priority. But I'm wondering the temperature complaints that we get and the service calls for temperature, how we square like where's the money coming from and how does this fit in with our high priority.

start time: 110:40:30.000
end time: 110:53:30.000
confidence: 0.38
D: Facilities?

start time: 111:16:30.000
end time: 120:47:12.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Chair Hollins, before we turn to Dan, can I just. I'd like to say something. And we have a lot of moving costs still with damaged facilities to schools in particular, not knowing exactly what insurance is going to cover. And then we've had some project information that may change some of the costs and timeline. And we're not going to get into all of that. Just in general there is a concern about facility costs right this minute because of storm damage.

start time: 120:49:36.000
end time: 120:56:16.000
confidence: 0.82
G: Storm.

start time: 120:56:48.000
end time: 122:01:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Storm damage. And also some construction potential delays.

start time: 122:42:00.000
end time: 122:48:16.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Yeah.

start time: 122:48:48.000
end time: 133:03:20.000
confidence: 0.89
E: And if I could just. I'll do kind of a quick recap. And the staff really highlight just the overall capital needs of the district and significant get deferred maintenance needs. And the fund, the potential funding options are finite. So there's general fund, there's limited non bond capital funds and then there's potential bond funds as well. But all those, you know, again are limited in the district's needs are pretty significant, especially in the existing facilities. So staff's recommendation was to continue the script of work as part of the 2024 bond plan.

start time: 133:16:50.000
end time: 133:24:42.000
confidence: 0.70
A: Okay.

start time: 133:25:46.000
end time: 134:41:10.000
confidence: 0.93
E: That was the recommendation. The resolution doesn't say where the funds would come from.

start time: 134:51:30.000
end time: 138:38:18.000
confidence: 0.91
A: That's why I want to answer that question. Where these particular funds, because of my understanding these funds was coming from leftover clim funds to pay for these repairs. So that's why I want to make sure we're clear.

start time: 138:40:34.000
end time: 140:09:52.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I mean I think that's a decision that would have to be made. The resolution doesn't specifically state where they're from.

start time: 140:11:06.000
end time: 142:32:00.000
confidence: 0.89
G: So I'll just say why the resolution doesn't say it because it used to give us that flexibility capital fund.

start time: 143:07:40.000
end time: 160:35:24.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So I'm very uncomfortable with that approach as part of our budget process. Part of our budget process, when board members bring forward resolutions or amendments, we wire say where the money's going to go, but also where it comes from. This is not a formal budget amendment, which is also a little bit problematic. But I think folks who are going to support the resolution need to indicate where the money is going to come from otherwise. And I guess getting to that. And this is Michelle, to your point, there is a trade off here and I guess I'm troubled. The resolution doesn't talk about that trade off. It just sounds great. We're going to authorize this money for Roosevelt. I want to authorize the money for Roosevelt too. I want them to have the grandstands. What it doesn't say are what's the sewer project that's to get done or the plumbing project or, you know, the other things. And I, I mean, I know, you know, to Superintendent Huss point. I mean, I, you know, we have 900 students right now who are displaced from their schools because, you know, their plumbing failed during the storm. It's a huge problem for those students. And I'm struggling a little bit with just, you know, authorizing to, you know.

start time: 160:35:32.000
end time: 160:51:24.000
confidence: 0.88
D: Two and a half million dollars for.

start time: 160:51:32.000
end time: 163:14:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Grandstands, which is going to take money away, I believe will take money away from deferred maintenance projects that might be higher priority. We don't know what those projects are.

start time: 163:19:00.000
end time: 164:06:36.000
confidence: 0.94
G: So I'm going to try and channel. Since he's not here.

start time: 164:07:48.000
end time: 164:14:20.000
confidence: 0.59
A: Yeah.

start time: 164:15:40.000
end time: 164:24:44.000
confidence: 0.47
F: And fairness.

start time: 164:25:32.000
end time: 164:30:20.000
confidence: 0.90
D: I'll try.

start time: 164:31:00.000
end time: 182:52:42.000
confidence: 0.96
G: I'll try and represent. So there was a discussion in committee about the leftover bond funds. And the case that Director Green made forcefully is the other. Most of the other modernization projects. This was incorporated as part of the modernization project and on a number of fronts. This is partly. And Franklin has a different set of issues, but they were like sort of the first high schools out of the chute. And Roosevelt, you know, didn't get built for 1700 students. It didn't have adequate CTE space and they didn't get the home grandstands that everybody else got. And so Director Green case that they've been waiting a long time. There's excess bond funds and that this was allocation from that.

start time: 182:53:06.000
end time: 183:01:14.000
confidence: 0.83
D: The original.

start time: 183:02:02.000
end time: 195:50:50.000
confidence: 0.94
G: The original asked whether at home he would say this much more energetically, you know, seating 1500 and visitor seating. But this is just the home seating, which is what most of the other. Which is what most of the other schools got in there, with the exception obviously Grant, because of the whole issues related to the Grant Bowl. And then so that that is speaking to that project for Mickey Daniels. They actually have a completed field house. It's just they can't use it until the final Construction is final 200,000 payment is made. And it's something that other.

start time: 196:35:50.000
end time: 196:46:22.000
confidence: 0.81
D: Field has.

start time: 196:46:46.000
end time: 197:18:10.000
confidence: 0.85
G: To take out through its modernization.

start time: 198:03:50.000
end time: 202:46:26.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah. And I guess, I mean, out of respect for Director Green, I'd be more than happy to, you know, if the board wanted to hold this over so he could be here to have the Conversation. I didn't realize he wasn't going to be here today. I do want to say I don't love the term excess bond funds because we don't have excess bond funds.

start time: 202:46:58.000
end time: 202:49:22.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Right.

start time: 202:49:46.000
end time: 216:21:12.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I mean, there's, there's certain projects that, you know, their budgets went up during the project. We might have come in under or had some extra contingency. But when you look through the memo, I mean, we don't have anywhere near enough funding in this district for all the different maintenance that we have. So, you know, it's excess from one pot. Our decision is not are we grabbing excess because it makes it sound like it's free money? Our decision is, are we prioritizing the Roosevelt grandstands above some of the other projects? And I understand Director Green's argument. I hear it. I also think looking through this, this memo at some of the other things and another school, the plumbing breaks, what are we going to tell the community? Right. And those kids are displaced and Roosevelt has some great grandstands. So that's.

start time: 216:22:16.000
end time: 218:08:20.000
confidence: 0.94
G: I'm curious, Dan, between insurance and. We don't have the resources to fix that.

start time: 218:33:20.000
end time: 219:26:48.000
confidence: 0.91
E: You're specific to the storm damage, and.

start time: 219:27:44.000
end time: 221:19:00.000
confidence: 0.89
B: I'm actually being broader than that. I'm not saying we're pitting plumbing against grandstands.

start time: 221:38:00.000
end time: 247:34:22.000
confidence: 0.92
A: I get that. If that. If we're talking about plumbing, which we're talking about certain places in the school, I understand we talk about the broader scope of the firm makes that needs to be done. We know it's 700 some million dollars or close to a billion dollars that has to be done. So I understand that, that we're talking about a broader piece and there's no regards. We take from here, we take from there. There never could be enough money to do all the deferred maintenance that we have that we just don't have the money for. So looking at one piece versus another one, and because we brought into bringing up the defer. I mean, the plumbing stuff, if that money was coming out of those, the bond funds versus the insurance, then that's a different conversation because then that's looking at, well, insurance is supposed to be paying for that. So then that's not in the conversation anymore as far as that piece. But if you're talking about the overall deferred maintenance, just want to make sure we're clear. We have almost a billion dollars worth of deferred maintenance. So this one piece is not going to put a dent in the overall deferred maintenance that we need to have here at PPS now getting Something that for a school in the underserved community gets versus other schools that have gotten the same stuff. When we talk about our bond fund, that's an equity issue. If you're saying this school shouldn't get it because it wasn't in the first one versus these schools because we learned more should get it. To me, that sounds like equity, not necessarily a prioritization piece, just my just.

start time: 247:34:46.000
end time: 255:20:50.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Like to weigh in again on the finances. This is a great conversation and dialogue and you all will make that decision. But I think what I've been hearing from staff, if the unknowns on finance, the unknowns on finances that continue to grow, concerns are damaged buildings and then there is a building that's under construction behind if they're going to stay on schedule, there could be some significant from a financial standpoint, those are the two things that seem to come to the top most important.

start time: 255:22:50.000
end time: 263:48:02.000
confidence: 0.91
A: So my question would be, for instance, the been behind on Benson, because that's what we're talking about, Benson High School. There's the money from here going to cover that Delta for what it might cost for Benson High School. If it is, then that's a different conversation. But if it's $20 million or $40 million, then that's not really a good comparison to use because that 2.5 million or whatever we're using for the grandstands is not going to cover that Delta.

start time: 263:49:06.000
end time: 280:07:14.000
confidence: 0.95
B: But it's 2.5 million towards it. So you hope it's larger. And I guess I want to make sure I don't want to make this. I was using the example of the displaced students in my zone more as an example of what could continue to happen. I don't but actually maybe flip it, you know, to, you know, last year we heard significant concerns about Oakley Green and Director Green, in fact went and visited and came back and said this school needs serious help. And I think my question is when. When we as a board and I want to. This is a really important conversation for us to have when we're talking about the very limited dollars and there's not enough. It's a question of where are we putting that? Should the $2.5 million go to grandstands, which I 100% believe Roosevelt needs and deserves, or should it go to fixing the rodent mold plumbing issues at Ockley Green? Well, we then talk in the bond about money for Roosevelt, and I'm happy to be the charge on this next bond making sure that money is included.

start time: 280:08:02.000
end time: 286:49:48.000
confidence: 0.93
G: I should say that was 2017, the 2012 bond and the other again I'm just trying my best to channel is field project happened without. During 10 fields project without any support from PBS. Without any support.

start time: 286:52:04.000
end time: 287:01:16.000
confidence: 0.87
D: Yes.

start time: 287:03:08.000
end time: 308:00:50.000
confidence: 0.94
G: They raised yeah all the money. Nike had a significant contribution. I think the city put something in as well. But PPS didn't put anything into it unlike most of the other fields. And that's a community that doesn't have the resources to do that. And it's just like. I know, I know we wouldn't. You know at one point the person who was previously in Marina's role like called me. It wasn't on the board then but about Franklin that they were going to put this the stubs of the stand in but not actually the seats because they were running out of money with that bond. And then they made the community pay for a different material for the outside of the performing arts center because they didn't have money. So those two schools, those two had some significant value engineering that happened. And one of the things that valued engineered at Roosevelt is they didn't get stance and that could be a decision the board wants to wait till the next bond. My perspective from an equity issue.

start time: 308:31:10.000
end time: 308:36:22.000
confidence: 0.61
D: We.

start time: 308:36:46.000
end time: 317:17:10.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Can do it now. And on the McDaniel piece we've got schools that serves many students of color, lower income students that has raised a lot of money for their own project. They can't like get over the finish line. So they have a completed building but they can't actually use it because they're $250,000 short project.

start time: 317:22:10.000
end time: 333:26:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yeah. And I just. And I'm not trying to put nobody's credit but we jumped to the chance of making a right or wrong way Grant. There was no issue about the money. It wasn't. The money wasn't even a option. I remember you said no matter what it costs, we need to. For grant for the field. For the field. Yeah. So I just, I don't understand why we're not having that same sense of urgency for Roosevelt and McDaniels have to say with the same sense of urgency. Now I understand that yeah, they're using the field and all that stuff. I get it. But it's the same urgency for Roosevelt with their grandstands and poor conditions that they're in. This should be the same urgency that we use for Grant for the field and going to redo the track even though the track wasn't the user knowledge the difference. But the track wasn't that bad.

start time: 333:40:30.000
end time: 335:00:22.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Those students were not able to use their field because it failed and PPS shut it down.

start time: 335:02:06.000
end time: 339:21:18.000
confidence: 0.92
A: But we Offer all the right money for the track, which is not necessarily a big priority because the track is okay, and we authorize money to redo the track. And I'm a track guy, so of course, I love that. But that wasn't a real big priority either. We, but we authorized it. So now we were doing the field.

start time: 339:22:14.000
end time: 342:16:14.000
confidence: 0.92
B: And doing the track. There was, there was some symbiosis there. I mean, again, I'm not, I feel like I'm getting pushed into this. Like I don't want Roosevelt to have the grandsons I do. But we're talking about their grandsons, right?

start time: 342:17:42.000

B: To me is that, you know, if this was an asset failure at Roosevelt, that kids were not able to use something, then it would be a different sense of urgency. But that's for me, the reason why I can wait is because you're talking about more spectators for their events, which is great. We should do it. You know, I also want to say I'm a little worried and I'm just, you know, a little worried we're misusing equity when it comes to this because we haven't really done an equity analysis. Right. I mean, Roosevelt's an underserved, you know, community for sure. So are other schools in that regions or other schools in Portland public schools. So I mean, to say, you know, it's an equity issue because Roosevelt doesn't have grandstands. Yes. That's not really the comparison. The comparison is do we build the grandstands or do we fix the. A much worse problem at a middle school or a grade school. Right. And I think those are the trade offs that we, we. I guess, I guess I'm getting this resolution makes those trade offs. It doesn't call them out. And I think that board members. And I'll just, I'm, I'm, I'm also happy to set it over if the board wants to so Director Green can make his comments. If not, I'm going to vote against it. I think board members who are going to support it.

A: So we thought, I'm going to speak on the equity piece. Right. And the reason why I say this equity piece because Grant has advocacy. Right. Grant has Parents who have resources and they've used it before, whether they threaten for a lawsuit with the, the, the Title nine stuff or just getting everyone together, they have the resources to do that. We don't have Roosevelt, don't have those folks with those type of resources. So when I talk about equity, it's not just because of the, the number of underserved kids that go to that school. It's the resources for that whole neighborhood is. So there is a, there's a difference. You know, so when we, that's one of the things when we say equity is what I'm talking about. It's not just black and white this way, it's this. They. Grant has great advocacy. They have people who got resources, they got people who can write letters, they got people who can come to meetings, they got people who can give passionate pleas while folks in underrepresented communities are working. They don't have the access to do that. They don't have the access to go hire attorneys. They don't have the access to go get man surveys and all that stuff. That's what I'm talking about. Equity.

You know, Chair Hollins, I think the comparison is why not use two and a half million dollars to solve the problems at Auckle Green, Right? Like why, why? And I, Director Green, I would love to hear from you since I didn't realize you were here. Like, like what are the trade offs here?

H: So thank you, everyone. I, I apologize. I've been trying to figure out how to, how to get on. I'm sitting in a hotel room, so there's that. When we start talking about Roosevelt, I want us to also recognize that we've been kicking the can on Roosevelt for, since, since the, since we began the modernization project. We keep kicking the can down the road saying that, you know, there's, there's going to be some other money and we'll be able to use that money. And then when the other money comes up, there's always a higher something else that ranks on the higher priority scale. The reality is all of our schools need, need a lot of support and we don't have enough money. To take care of all the problems that our schools have within all the schools. And I want to see. I want to see all of our schools get the support and the funding and the type of resources that they need. I want to see everybody in schools where the heat works when it's supposed to work and the air works when it's supposed to work. I'm speaking about Roosevelt right now because Roosevelt, for it to be one of our schools that serves, you know, marginalized kids. The marginalized community doesn't have a lot of the supports, and yet they were able to raise a lot of the funding on their own, going out to community members, going out to business organizations, going out to the different ones to try to figure out how to get something when nobody was giving them anything. And they weren't the only school. So I've made the mistake of saying that Roosevelt was the only school that did this. And then I find out later that that's not actually the case. There were a few other schools that did it, but those few other schools also were in communities where the funding was a lot more significant than it was in the Roosevelt community. So although those other communities may have been able to do it, it wasn't quite the same. When you start thinking about millionaires, when millionaires give up hundreds of thousands of dollars is not a big deal. But when mom and pops give up hundreds of thousand dollars, it's a big deal. It's significant. We keep kicking the can when it comes to Roosevelt. So we keep telling our black students and our brown students that, you know what, there's always going to be some money later. You just keep holding on, you just keep waiting, and we're going to get this for you. And all the while we're trusting and we're believing that it's actually going to happen. And in fact, it never does. It just keeps getting pushed down the road, down the road for the next day. Now, yes, Andrew, everything that you're talking about is dead on. We have middle schools that need support. George. Middle schools could use support. Cesar Chavez, There's a lot of middle schools within that same area that could use some support. But those middle schools haven't been promised year after year some of the same things that Roosevelt has been promised. And we need to stop kicking this can down the road, and we just need to do it. We need to stop lying and saying that, you know, hey, we care about you. Honestly, we do. Just wait till the next time. Let's do it and let's get it done. And then when it comes time to do the stuff with the middle schools, let's just do it and let's get it done. Let's not keep waiting and saying, next time, next time, next time. Because the thing that is always approaching and never arrives is tomorrow. And that's what we keep telling Roosevelt. Wait till tomorrow. So my issue with this is that we've been telling them that it's going to come and it hasn't arrived. We've been saying that we're going to do it, and we haven't done it. The time is now. It's not about tomorrow. It's about what we can do today. We can decide today that we're going to end this situation. We're going to appreciate Roosevelt and the Roosevelt community for all the hard labor that they put into this and understanding that they all made sacrifices, understand that they all gave, and we're going to allow this to be the first step on the ladder that says we're going to start beginning to do the things that we said we were going to do as it pertains to our schools and those other schools that we promised up to then we need to stop kicking the can down the road, and we need to figure out how to get there. But I think it starts with Roosevelt, the same way the modernization project started with Roosevelt. I think the day of kicking the can down the road needs to stop here, and we need to start doing what we said we were going to do. And that's where I sit with that. Andrew, you've been a part of this board for a long time, and I know that you've seen a lot of the stuff that goes on. I know that you're aware of it. And I also know that you're very frugal and you want to know where it's all going to come from. And we go back and forth on these types of things a lot. I get it. I get it. And I also recognize that we have an opportunity now to make something right with the community that we have wronged for years.

B: Yeah, yeah. And we don't need to prolong the conversation. And I think, Director Green, to your point, I appreciate it all. What you're talking about is accuracy for Roosevelt, and we're talking about what Roosevelt gets, and that's very Important. What the conversation is missing is what is not going to happen. Instead, and I'll be blunt, what are we going to tell the next school that experiences a failure, that kicks a teacher out of their classroom, or a whole wing that shuts down or something else that happens that. That where this two and a half million dollars, you know, could have been spent? And, and I guess I just want to make it clear that is the decision. We're not, as a board, just making a decision tonight. Do we support grandstands at Roosevelt or not? We're saying, do we support grandstands over some of the project? Which is why I would support, and I would be a cheerleader for putting this money in the bond, because then we're very clearly saying to the community, this money, it's designated for the grandstands. This is what you're voting on, among lots of other things, and that's what we're going to spend it on. Taking money that wasn't allocated for it, that could be spent on these other higher priorities and moving to the grandstands. It is a, it's a policy decision, one the board can absolutely make and one that I'm concerned about.

F: I have a question about. I mean, so we're talking about grandstands, which I'm not a sports person, so pardon me to my colleagues, but are the other systems at the building, to your knowledge, working the ventilating and the roof and some of those other pieces.

start time: 512:37:18.000
end time: 521:30:22.000
confidence: 0.91
E: I can't speak with precision on all the systems. The Roosevelt had mechanical system challenges for a number of years, much in part due to the phasing of which it was completed. Those have largely been resolved. Roosevelt has also had a number of additions and phases of additional recruitment over the years. So I think generally it's definitely one of our better facilities. It's, you know, one of the very top best sort of renewal facilities compared to our schools that are technically served in critical condition from the facility. Conditions as, as.

start time: 521:32:06.000
end time: 525:24:10.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Dan, would it also be accurate to say that the, the building underneath the grandstands is technically, like, condemned? Like, we don't want nobody going in it. We use caution tape over it and tell, you know, don't, don't use this building because we don't trust it.

start time: 525:40:00.000
end time: 527:11:00.000

confidence: 0.96
H: I know, I know that we allow the athletic director to go into the building because it used to be like a storage room and now they can barely use it. And so it's considered technically an Unsafe space, but it hasn't completely fallen down yet, so it's somewhat okay. Still. This is the type of stuff that I'm talking about, that we allow this mediocre stuff to continue to persist. Our marginalized schools or our marginalized communities, we allow these types of things to continue to sit there and continue to fester and continue to go along. And then we turn around and say, trust that the system has your best interest in mind. The reason that I struggle with that is because I haven't seen it. And so you're asking me to have faith in something that I haven't seen before. And so that's where I'm struggling. And so that's why I feel like we need to do this now. We need to stop kicking the can down the road and we need to get this done for our students now.

A: Act with the grants, with this, with this resolution here and a grandstand skin done by this time for 24 spring sports, would that money could have been used elsewhere in that same shorter time frame? And would that affect if we actually add extra money like we're doing for deferred maintenance on the bond that we hopefully get passed in November? So I don't look at it as we're choosing this or, or over this. I think it's like, okay, we're going to do this now, and then with the bot, we can add extra money for deferred maintenance to work on all the other stuff that you talked about. So, any other questions? Thoughts?

A: So that's my. Okay, so my question is, with all the things that you mentioned, when is the timeline to get those fixed? I'm sure that's going to be more than $2.5 million. So what is the timeline of getting those fixed? And would that timeline, could that potential timeline come after or will that potential timeline come after the 2024 bond?

start time: 579:14:22.000

E: Our plumbers identified five to 10 sewer mains that need to be replaced. There's two real challenges in it. One is world resources, one is money, and two is staff. We only have so many staff. So if we do allocate funds and specifically a timeline, we are then allocating funds to that project and we are taking resources, staff to complete that project away from other projects that are currently either active or.

start time: 587:59:36.000
end time: 593:41:10.000
confidence: 0.90
A: So let's get to my question is if we talk about the projects that you're mentioning and with this timeline that they have here for the grandstands, the stuff that you're mentioning, that timeline would happen before the 2024 bond with the staffing that you're talking about the. Or would it happen after the 2024 bond?

start time: 594:16:10.000
end time: 595:01:22.000
confidence: 0.95
E: If you're asking, all deferred maintenance would be completed.

start time: 595:02:26.000
end time: 595:46:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Just the ones that you mentioned? Just the one that you mentioned.

start time: 596:04:10.000
end time: 603:53:20.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Let me add some context. So we have a facility condition, for example, there's literally thousands of deficiencies noted. Those require further investigation to actually put together a scope of work, work to go out and bid that and complete that work. So to say that they're not all shovel ready. So to say that we would spend that specific amount of money in six months, I don't think is accurate. What I think to say is if we could plan for those funds, then those projects would move forward.

start time: 604:03:40.000
end time: 607:11:24.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So it's safe to say that with the deferred maintenance that you're mentioning, those would not necessarily get done before the 2024 bond is passed. Safe to say that.

D: Like, I think there's. Again, it's what Director Green's saying, right. We have a situation where, you know, whether. Whether real or not, but, you know, there has been the impact of Roosevelt and the community feeling forgotten for years and years and years. And, and, you know, it wasn't on purpose because I know, you know, one of the things are, you know, I'm. I'm a stickler for deferred me. That's like one of my top priorities.

end time: 629:30:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: But yeah, I mean, it's one of those things that wish we could have done this five years ago, but we didn't. And here we are in even probably more precarious, worse situation. There's also the non monetary cost of a community that feels like it's not again waiting or having been promised something and not getting it. And when we weigh that cost, I think that that kind of tips me over the fence.

start time: 630:08:20.000
end time: 670:33:50.000
confidence: 0.95
G: I want to just speak to that too because so I was here the first month back on the board in 2017 is when we opened Roosevelt. And yes, it was one of the first schools in the Vaughan, but it's the only school that we built for 1400 students. And it was like, you're going to get lesser because you have fewer students. And they then spent, I don't know, two or three years coming to Facility and Operations Committee meeting about the CTE space so much time because they didn't get adequate CTE space. And then they, you know, they had to come advocate for like give us some CTE space. And so, you know, I would say I don't think it was an intentional shorting of, but I think that was the impact that the community felt. I think we hadn't had a Bond in since 1995. So you know, our ad specs have gotten better and crispr in subsequent bonds. But that first bond, I mean for sure they had to come back and advocate for things that are now just automatic in, in some of the projects. And like I say, I, I saw, you know, my neighborhood high school, Franklin, what, you know, some of the things that ask parents to pay for material now we didn't on other, other projects. So again, I, I don't think it was intentional but certainly the impact was, you know, they had to come back on our CTE space at Roosevelt and we learned from that. And I think then when there was a question like should we build at the time Madison, now McDaniel, for 1700 students, should we build it for 1400 like we did for Roosevelt? We said no, we're going to build it for 1700 because that's the right thing to do for that community. And wow, I think it was the right, it was the right decision. So again, I don't think it was. It probably lands to the Roosevelt community as feeling that way because that's what the impact was.

C: So I, I just think it's an unfinished project and we should finish it and it's going to cost money and that money is never, there's never going to be enough money and we can't take it to do one other particular project. So it just sounds as I'm listening to this that it's unfinished and we need to finish it and that it. I wish that somehow maybe in the resolution it had said the money is coming from, blah, blah, where we're bringing it from. But I think we know we don't have enough. But this is something that needs to be finished.

F: And Chair Hollins, I also just want to appreciate you for daylighting the. The issue about advocacy, because if equity isn't just about, you know, skin color or whatever, it also has income and privilege. And, you know, the grant community does have resources to, you know, come and advocate for the community and.

start time: 735:45:40.000
end time: 741:13:52.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Well, and in all those districts and schools, whether they've got money or not, it's the kids we're thinking about in all the schools. And I don't think we can keep using equity, equity, equity all the time. We have to think we want the best for each school. And Roosevelt needed, you know, they were.

confidence: 0.93
F: And can I ask one more question? So the expense at the time that Russell was put on the bond, was it. Was it now? I thought that was the stuck says 1700. Was that not the case?

end time: 748:03:22.000

start time: 748:06:26.000
end time: 752:25:14.000
confidence: 0.96
F: The ED spec, the specifications book that we go by to modernize schools, I believe now calls for building it to the size of 1700. But I was curious what the Spec said at the time. I'm just curious about it.

start time: 752:28:02.000
end time: 771:12:30.000
confidence: 0.95
H: At the time, they had. Did a Portland and Dan could jump in, but they did a Portland State University study, and they were talking about the Roosevelt community wasn't going to grow beyond what it was. So they technically wanted to build school to 1200. The community began to advocate for 1700, and at the end of the day, they landed at 1400 with a promise that on the east side of the school where the cafeteria used to be, that they would put money into the next bond so that they could build up a space that would hold the other 300 students in the Years to come. But that was going to be a promise that was coming again. What I keep bringing up, what I keep trying to, trying to spell out is that we, when it comes to the, to the Roosevelt community, it's like you're the children under the stairs. You're the, you know what I'm saying? You're the stepchild. And you know what I'm saying, take what you can get and be happy with what we gave you. And then we come back and we say, oh, that wasn't cool. And we give every other school after that everything that. You know what I'm saying, that we promised, you know what I'm saying? We're going to get you.

A: Some context if it's, Is it going to help? Is the contact that you're going to get? We're going to go to him. Heed your vote. Okay. So can you guys get together?

start time: 777:01:48.000
end time: 795:05:48.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I'd be interested in the context after the meeting. I think. George agreement. I'm sorry, I just, I need to respond because I just feel like we continue to frame this as, as, you know, simply doing right by Roosevelt, which we all want to do. And there are ways to do that and just. But I feel the need to read from the staff memo. Staff have identified five to 10 sanitary sewer lines in critical condition in just the last few weeks. Astor elementary was closed for one day due to a sewer backup. In Jefferson High School was closed due to a tyranny of water supply line that caused flooding. I'm not sure if you were on the call yet, but I talked about your visit to Oakley Green last year, which was very compelling to me as you expressed your, you know, what you saw there and the issue. So it's, I think it's really, it's not fair to use Grant as an easy sort of like, oh, well, we did something nice for Grant. We got to do something nice for Roosevelt. The decision the board is making tonight is are we going to take care of the critical sanitary sewer lines at our schools? Are we going to take care of the issues at Ockley Green, or are we going to build grandstands at Roosevelt? Grandstands at Roosevelt are important. They are not more important to me than these critical issues that keep our schools open and operate. And I think that's, that's the trade off we're making. And I Feel that any to keep talking.

start time: 795:08:44.000
end time: 796:56:00.000
confidence: 0.87
A: I have a question. So by us doing a grandstands with those things in the memo, will they not get done because of the grandstands?

start time: 797:24:20.000
end time: 798:09:20.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Can I just answer two and a half million dollars less stuff?

start time: 798:51:00.000
end time: 804:28:16.000
confidence: 0.92
A: I'm just saying, if you're saying in the, in the memo, I'm just asking if we do the grandstands because then I might change my vote. If you're telling me, well we won't be able to get to those because we doing the grand stance, that might, that might alter my vote. But if you're saying that no, that's not going to affect it, then that might alter my vote as well. But because you're bringing it up, eventually.

start time: 804:28:48.000
end time: 804:49:04.000
confidence: 0.98
H: It'S going to get done.

start time: 804:51:52.000
end time: 806:08:48.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Is it not going to get done if we do these grandstands or can we do both?

start time: 806:11:04.000
end time: 809:25:30.000
confidence: 0.88
E: You asked a question earlier about where the funds would come from. The memo talks about the board or members several years ago asked staff to bring back what the cost Savings was for. LinkedIn estimates.

start time: 809:26:00.000
end time: 809:36:10.000
confidence: 0.34
D: There's.

start time: 809:45:50.000
end time: 828:39:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: We're projecting at the time. So we brought that back. That was that $17 million number. But also identified, as noted here, there are lots of things that those funds could go towards and there is still risk within the bond program. So because 2017 bonds is not complete, if there is a scenario in which that those funds, 10 of those have been set aside for this allegation through different agreement that the district needs those funds to complete the 2017 bond projects, then if there's 2.5 million last, they still need to find another 2.5 million from somewhere to complete the 2017 bond funds. And that could be something else. It could be the general fund. It could be something. If the district were to say we want to spend bond savings on deferred maintenance items, we wouldn't go do those necessarily right away. We would probably wait until the bond program got ordered towards its end and then we would look to allocate those to projects that aren't completed, such as mechanical, electrical, plumbing type systems.

start time: 828:44:50.000
end time: 830:49:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So again, so it's safe to say that those priorities that you mentioned in the memo will still get done.

start time: 831:02:20.000
end time: 831:28:20.000
confidence: 0.79
E: I'm not saying that they'll still get.

start time: 831:30:20.000
end time: 832:09:24.000
confidence: 0.99
C: Maybe if there's enough money, we could.

start time: 832:10:52.000
end time: 835:35:20.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Dedicate this to major maintenance after the 27 bond is closed. And I think Dan also made a point about staff working on this versus working on other projects. That's another reality of what's going to happen on this timeline.

start time: 835:43:40.000
end time: 835:58:40.000
confidence: 0.81
A: All right.

start time: 836:03:40.000
end time: 842:21:40.000
confidence: 0.91
F: I'm just curious one more. Is there A pathway forward. I'm asking again conversationally to fix the plumbing first because I think that's a. That's a sanitation issue. Switch backing up is sanitation and I would prioritize that over a ground stamp. Is there a path forward sequencing wise to do both?

start time: 843:24:00.000
end time: 846:25:14.000
confidence: 0.90
E: I'd say so. We've got seven non bond fundamentals. We'll say project managers may have I don't know how many bond funded but they're fine. We've been trying to hire for each years. We can't fill our books. So we are completing the number of.

start time: 846:25:22.000
end time: 846:54:50.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Projects that we're able to staff right.

start time: 846:55:30.000
end time: 851:10:18.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Now and obviously ones that are funded if we just add more funds or direct more. It's coming from somewhere. So if we say I want you to complete this project next year, whatever it is. For example the. I'm going to guess 40 to 60%.

start time: 851:11:14.000
end time: 851:42:50.000
confidence: 0.86
D: Of our staff time on are working.

start time: 851:43:30.000
end time: 853:25:34.000
confidence: 0.80
E: On market membrane and restoring their projects. Other projects are stopped, even the ones that have funds because we don't have.

start time: 853:25:42.000
end time: 853:50:22.000

D: The staff time to do them.

start time: 853:53:26.000
end time: 857:13:02.000
confidence: 0.97
E: So if we are going to pick any project and say you're going to. You're going to take those resources, you're going to complete that next year. That means other work is not getting done in that timeline because we don't have the management to do that work. The books are full.

start time: 857:16:06.000
end time: 859:16:46.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So could we say for instance instead of having a spring of 24 timeline maybe we extend that timeline out.

start time: 859:17:58.000

start time: 869:11:30.000
end time: 874:02:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: But if we're talking about sequencing, like as the director of the past said if you talk about sequencing we sequencing some of the other stuff that you've mentioned. The past mentioned that that means you can sequence it with those other projects first and then get to the other one later. Right?

start time: 874:12:50.000
end time: 875:58:30.000
confidence: 0.92

So next we will be moving on to our budget work sessions with the community Budget Review Committee, or more commonly known and the cprc. Thank you for being here this evening, everyone. You guys do a lot of volunteers. The volunteer position that they folks do, they review, evaluate and make recommendations to the board regarding the superintendent's proposed budget and other budgetary issues. The board also monitors and advise the board on allocation of the expenditures of the local option levy, which we're hoping to make sure is a yes vote to everybody out there watching. So we'll thank you guys for your time, your dedication and your commitment. And I will turn over to Superintendent Dr. Husk.

C: Thank you. Chair Hollins. As you know, we're in the middle and moving through quickly the annual budget process of staffing schools for next year and sharing with you in the broader community an overall budget for schools and central office that will bring to you hopefully for your approval and adoption here soon. As I mentioned in the last official board meeting, this year's timeline for sharing a proposed budget is much more condensed than any of us would like. There were a variety of things that led to that. No one thing that created this kind of situation, but there was a lot of things that led to that. So we're in a very, very tight timeline for figuring out how to reduce the 2425 school year budget by 30 million. The impact of this budget is going to be felt in many, many places in the district. I've been doing this a long time. I went through the Great Recession in Salem Kaiser. I knew what happened during that time period. And we are going to feel this. We really appreciate all the thoughtful questions that you raised. And I want to thank the staff for the hard work they've done on the responses. I've asked Deputy Superintendent Lee to work us through this workshop. He's asked Dr. Adams, Dr. Bernard Adams, to facilitate part of the conversation so we can get lots of questions and thoughts into the room in an organized fashion. And I also want to say that whenever you go through these kind of budget processes, especially a year where we've had as much stress and strain as we did in this particular school year. Not quite as bad as the COVID year, but definitely been very unusual. One of the things I like to think about is how we're going to feel about each other on the other side because we'll get through it. We'll make budget reductions, we'll explain them. Support staff, support students. We'll get through it. But on the other side, not have to. But when we get a chance to look at each other and work together, I'm hoping that we can say we had a thoughtful and a respectful process and we feel pretty good about what we did. So thank you for volunteering. Budget committee members, thank you for volunteering to serve on a board. And to the rest of you who are here tonight that are interested.

And so we have a slide and a placeholder for us to then come back and have conversation and discussion about what CDRC members and board directors are noticing and wondering.

I should be careful with my athletics metaphors, but given the content of the previous discussion. But. But we really appreciate it. We know that you're spending a lot of time on many topics and this is one of the primary ones of the spring. So I wanted to just at a very high level, share our goals for tonight. And then if it's okay to allow our awesome CBRC members to introduce themselves briefly just for. For everybody who's in the room or tuned in. So at a very high level, we wanted to share some brief updates about the process and progress in developing the budget for next year, which is headed towards in about five weeks, presentation of the superintendent's recommended budget on April 23. Dr. Adams has described the notice and Wonder protocol. Thank you, Dr. Adams, for, for offering this, for facilitating that portion of the discussion. And then we wanted to preview some of the next steps in the process. So with that, may I just ask our CBRC members to just take a minute to introduce yourselves and maybe say how long you've been on the.

D: Taz, if you're listening, if you wouldn't mind introducing yourself briefly and if not, we can come back when you're, when you're able to speak so we can continue in the meantime. So as everybody is aware and as Dr. Husk mentioned, we are seeking to address a gap of about $30 million, 30, 31 million for the upcoming year. And that remains our working estimate of the projection. And that is subject to change, but that's still what we're working and organizing around. We wanted to say a couple of things about our approach to shaping the recommendations that are in progress. And I don't want to read the whole slide here, but basically the key points about how decisions, how budget decisions are made, there is a lens about identifying core requirements, core program elements, and then for additional resources, additional investments, trying to look through a specific series of questions so items that are potentially above and beyond the core requirements, we are looking at these questions. Again, I won't read them all, but just to paraphrase some of these, to look at questions about program impact. Are the desired goals being met or how closely are we seeing the outcomes, the level of resources the students served and focal student groups and communities perspectives about the program. So these are all thematic questions and we just want to orient all of our discussions around these types of questions because we are in a mode of having to be even more intentional about these types of questions and allocating scarce resources. We have previously in your former meetings or former presentations, prior presentations, we have mentioned this that we have engaged our school leaders principals through a number of means. One is a pretty comprehensive survey that was administered in January. I think we've highlighted some of the themes and the results from that feedback. We are also about to engage in more interactive feedback in person at an upcoming principals meeting. So again, just in the interest of time, we'll go through all of the details about the process of this engagement, but we are trying to stay attuned to the expertise and experience of our school leaders. The next few slides are focusing on pretty high level information about the work that's in progress to identify essentially reductions to central budgets, centrally allocated resources. And one highlight, or low light as the case may be, is that as we've said in prior meetings, including the February 20th meeting, within that $30 million gap that we're trying to address, we had roughly been working around this is not by formula but just in the collective thinking that has taken place so far over the past few months, we have been organizing around roughly equivalent or similar amounts in terms of total dollars of savings from school based budgets versus central budgets or centrally allocated budgets. That is still close to true. There's some potential shifts to a degree. So you see this statement at the middle says central budget reductions will likely total to 15 to 17 million. So that's still being worked on in terms of whether it's 15, whether it's 17, but there's a possibility that might get a little bit north of $15 million. At a very high level. The work that staff teams have been doing around what those reductions might look like, what the what the form of the reductions might look like. They are likely to be. The great majority of those are likely to be in terms of staffing personnel, a combination of vacant and field positions, and a lot of details very random is happening and needs to continue before we before we have a precise set of recommendations featured in that superintendent's recommended budget. But that's kind of the general preliminary shape and then the rest of the total will come from non personnel reductions, primarily contracts, but other non people, resources, supplies, materials, etc. So again these are, these are all around the preliminary estimates of a $30 million gap. And as additional information and decisions and work continues, these figures may shift. There will be impacts of these reductions as Dr. Husk mentioned. And we are trying to again be strategic and intentional about the possible ways. More difficult to make some of these reductions with the least amount of disruption. But there will be some disruption, there will be impact. So some of the themes here, central office operations will be streamlined and services will be consolidated. There will be some impacts on school sites service impacts. We are continuing to look at spending policies around non personnel costs, trying to scale back some of those costs, although they don't add up to the majority of our budget. Still important and meaningful to save some of those dollars where we can. And more information, as we've said a few times, will be shared in April. The next slide really is a pretty comprehensive list. This is reflecting a broad based approach as Dr. Huss mentioned. Within that 15 to 17 million dollars subtotal for centrally allocated resources, centrally managed budgets, we're looking pretty much at every function. This list is not meant to single out any particular departments as saying we're only focusing on these departments. It really is a comprehensive approach and we're again looking at staff positions as well as non personnel costs. And I will point out and we've gotten several questions and observations about this, these resources include the common feature of these budgets are that they are allocated centrally and they're managed centrally. That's not to say that every position or every investment in this centrally budgeted resources involves a person who comes to PEC to work every day. It is a bit of a combination of folks that I think most of the personnel do serve in a centralized capacity but there are some, as you can see on the booths that do provide their services at schools but the budgets are mixed. Central View we're almost to the notice and wonder portion of the discussion but before we go there we wanted to highlight, and this is a very helpful point that Director Britt Edwards and others have made in some of our prior meetings that even though we are in a tough context in this cycle and in the next couple of cycles, most likely we also wanted to that over time this predates my time with pps, but over time PPS has made some very important innovative equity based investments in the budget. And this is not necessarily drawn to Scale, but. Or reflecting. But some of the investments that we've been reminding ourselves of and that board members and other community members have also been pointing out over the last few months. It's very important that we have these investments and that we'll be able to maintain them. In some respects, they might be a little bit reduced, but. But to appreciate the investments that have been made over the years, make a difference to our students. With that, I will turn it over to Dr. Adams.

I: Good evening again, everyone. And so hopefully during the time when Deputy Lee was speaking, you were able to jot down some noticings and had some questions. I know you probably came with the list, which is great. We expect those and we are happy to answer them. And I thought what we could do is just start at the far end of the table to my left here. Give everybody about another 30, 45 seconds to jot down as the people were still writing. I want to respect that. I was always told that my wait time wasn't long enough when I was a teacher. So let me fill up the space with some air while. Fill up the space with some words while you all continue to write down your thoughts.

D: Yes, sir. So, and sorry, we didn't. We didn't spell this out explicitly, but if CBRC members in particular, or board members for that matter would care to be more in listening mode and not feeling compelled to share a notice or wonder, that's okay. We're just trying to invite your thought. And that applies certainly for our CBRC members that are joining remotely. So don't feel like you. You have to stand and deliver your comments on this. I'll make a short observation. The presentation says thus far has already been presented to cbrc. And what we're looking for is more specifics and to be able to render an evaluation and recommendations.

C: I appreciate that and we continue to hear that. I just want to make sure. Because I don't think I said it at CRBC the last time when I was. I think I was remote. We are working on that every single day. And then we move through the process. They're very intense HR processes that we use, including communicating with employees who might be impacted before we make public announcements. And when you get to the central office, the specifics will start to identify positions. And we just need to make sure that we value the fact that people are very dedicated and working hard here. But we hear you. We really do.

G: I guess I'm noticing in the central staffing cuts things like custodial, preschool and student support which I understand to be special education mostly.

F: Is that right?

start time: 1246:56:50.000
end time: 1252:43:30.000
confidence: 0.94
C: There are some special education people that are assigned to this building who go out and help with services in the schools versus the special education staff that are justice schools, custodial services, my understanding all get staffed out of this budget. The custodians are in the schools, but the budget sits here.

start time: 1252:56:30.000
end time: 1255:16:06.000
confidence: 0.96
G: And I heard that no specific area is being like targeted specifically, but it's.

start time: 1255:16:38.000
end time: 1255:33:58.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Like across the board.

start time: 1255:36:14.000
end time: 1262:14:00.000
confidence: 0.94
G: So my wondering is, I guess twofold. Why are certain areas such as preschool, custodial and special education not able to be held harmless? And are the percentage of cuts based on their percentage of their budget equivalent like to communications and custodial or are there bigger cuts percentage wise to their budget being made?

start time: 1262:20:20.000
end time: 1273:57:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I'll take a stab at that in my five weeks here and then can correct me if I'm wrong, but my impression that what they did was they knew that they needed to come up with a reduction and so they asked managers to, to look at where we could find some efficiencies and still include continue services versus giving everybody the same straight percentage. So there's some places where we might have had some one time funding or some things shifted in the way that we received the money and staff used that as an opportunity to say okay, now we're going to make these changes now and, and it will also help us because it's a budget reduction.

start time: 1274:43:20.000
end time: 1276:49:00.000
confidence: 0.94
G: So I'd be curious to see the specifics of what percentage of the cuts in each of those areas compared to the others.

start time: 1277:22:00.000
end time: 1277:55:00.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Not that close to what happened.

start time: 1278:06:00.000
end time: 1290:31:16.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Absolutely. And it's definitely been balancing act. We have intentionally not taken an approach where there's a specific percentage that every department or division or office has to identify. And at the same time we want to, we want to, we're striving to see some contributions if you will, from all of the major parts of the organization, parts of the district so that, so that there's sense of some shared responsibility for the situation.

start time: 1290:34:28.000
end time: 1298:08:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: And I would also say the other observation I have is that a lot of data has been used and so when we look at, and I'm going to use the special education program specifically when we look at making changes there, a lot of IEPs are analyzed and a lot of the needs of the kids are thought about so that when the changes come through, we're ensured that we can still meet the needs of those kids. It'll be easier when we can go into specifics.

start time: 1299:32:20.000
end time: 1303:31:33.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So I have a wonder here. I'm wondering, do $30 million in cuts, does that take into account additional instructional time, maybe added on texture? If there's a cost around that. And I'm also wondering if the $30.

D: I just might add, in previous years, CBRC has been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement and we have done that. And to my mind at least we ought to be shared certain information that is presented to the board. That has not been the practice every year. And so the attitude maybe has changed, I don't know. But, and I have to say, in the 15 years I've been on the committee, the only violation has emanated from the board and not from the cprc.

D: I noticed that a 30 million dollar cut is disastrous. You mean from where I'm sitting? You know, last year before we were facing this iceberg in front of us, the trash cans outside, trash cans were removed from our school as a cost savings measure. There are no more trash cans outside. Like you can't throw anything away outside at Lewis. And so that's how austere we were being then. I really can't wrap my head around how we squeeze this stone anymore. One thing I am curious about is I continually seem to. It seems like we're perpetually updating curriculum and it's like a big process. A lot of companies are coming in and that process from start to finish to the end of it with teachers having to completely throw out their lesson plans. I mean you could rent a repeat over lesson plan from last year and that's a major time saving.

C: So people tend to mean a lot of things when they see curriculum. I actually did that job many jobs ago. I was the executive director of curriculum and instruction. So curriculum to me means you have teaching standards and those don't change dramatically from year to year. We might get some new things in social studies and sciences, definitely sciences, they should be changed. And then they also refer to the materials that we use and how those aligned and the choices teachers make when they make those lesson plans and when the assessments change or you've got some change in your demographic and student needs change. Then you see people shifting internally. But from a district level, a Typical curriculum adoption change cycle is anywhere from three to seven years. I've been in districts where it's been more than seven years and it's horrible because the materials get further and further behind. It's my impression and I don't know this, I don't have everything memorized yet. It's my impression that when the instruction team that's here now came in, it had been many years since we'd done it adoption. So I think there's been some catch up that's been happening and it is costly because when you're doing them all, like if you do language arts one year and math next year, you are seeing curriculum purchases and you're seeing professional development and pacing. Those is challenging. And all of them are out of date.

G: So last Bond we put K12, all subjects, curriculum updates in the bond. So it's not out of our operational dollars. The other thing is since ballot measure 5 after ballot measure 5 pass PPS got rid of the curriculum department and so perpetually we went out of compliance and Division 22 in our materials. So part of the when we had the opportunity finally because in 2020 was the first time the state allowed bond funds to be used used for curriculum. So we did, we did a big catch up. And one of the things is before we did that, like when my kids went through PPS it was all like 20 year old textbooks. I mean it was really bad. So this is part of the catch up. But it's not coming out of operating.

end time: 1487:27:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Okay. Yeah. So, yes, the cuts align to the board goals, but what will. What will be impacted in my prediction is our ability to implement those goals will not be as quick because we're reducing staff, we're reducing spending. And the original plan when the goals were put together was based on what we had in front of us at the time. The idea, federal funding goals and the needs of students will be met on their IEPs. The other clarification I would share is that when you. When we say we're cutting programs, what we're doing is reducing staffing within programs. As far as I know, and I could be wrong, I don't think we've eliminated any programs, but we're trying to continue to offer the same things with fewer people or less time per person overall because we didn't get any direction to eliminate programs. So we came in and said we'll reduce them the best we can and do our best to still provide a service may not be the same service. That's why I started by saying we're going to feel this help.

confidence: 0.94
D: Thank you. You're welcome. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm Luke Suswood. I do definitely understand the specifics on like, positions. And so, you know, other than that, I'm kind of wondering, you know, in general, do we have specifics on what that's gonna look like department by department or like school by school? And when we do, will the CBRC have an opportunity to look over that before those are actually implemented? And we can't actually give any feedback into it.

start time: 1498:21:44.000
end time: 1511:42:26.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So that's a really good question. This is a big organization. There are 8,000 people working in PPS. And so as the drilling down in the organization goes, then they have to put all that together to say, okay, if these are all, all the positions, then they go over to HR and they have a whole other process that the attorney helps them with where they go through them. And they do a screening for equity and all those kinds of things. Then we'll be able to talk to employees and then we'll be able to bring you those lists. Will you be able to look at the list and say I want you to keep this position? You can do that. You can look at it and you can say that whether or not that's doable will depend on where we are in the process. Does that help?

start time: 1511:44:58.000
end time: 1511:50:26.000

D: Yeah.

start time: 1511:50:58.000

B: Final, is that correct?

start time: 1513:23:30.000
end time: 1523:59:00.000
confidence: 0.96
C: The 100% final is when the board votes on it. When the board adopts the budget and votes up until that there are proposals and recommendations. But there are certain things that get really complicated because some of them have to do with employment contracts, some of them have to do with labor contracts, some of them have to do with communications to the public. So how much of that you can unwind? Like let's say we bring a proposal out and the board didn't like it and they said we want you to unwind this. Sometimes we would have to say here are the consequences of doing that. Okay. I'm not trying to be evasive. It's just complicated.

F: I was wondering if you.

start time: 1541:42:42.000
end time: 1561:45:10.000
confidence: 0.91
D: And maybe talk about like what the spending policies are right now. I see. So I mean I would say two things. One is there are a number of specific administrative directives, administrative guidelines about things like contracts and travel and reimbursement for meal out of pocket expenses for meals while traveling. So there are a lot of very specific regulations I guess that are. That are written into board policy or administrative directives. These are all viewable on the district's website. So I'm not necessarily focused on making significant changes to those. Although we rule that out. But we're perhaps Dr. Husk to talk about this just generally being more selective about expenditures that are discretionary of this nature.

start time: 1561:57:30.000
end time: 1570:12:52.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah, I wasn't at the beginning of the budget building process. And so I went with what was proposed by Guadalupe by not focusing on things that might have high symbolic impact, but they don't bring great results in terms of the number being bigger. We focused instead on those things that we thought we could make a few suggestions of changes over what the past superintendent recommended. I'm having trouble hearing you.

start time: 1570:13:16.000
end time: 1572:40:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Oh, sorry. I know there is some like planned community engagement, but I was wondering if we know any specifics about what that's going to look like and then also.

start time: 1572:49:10.000
end time: 1573:25:16.000
confidence: 0.97
F: What the goal is, what is going.

start time: 1573:25:18.000
end time: 1573:51:30.000
confidence: 0.87
D: To be done with that feedback.

start time: 1574:01:10.000
end time: 1580:52:20.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So this is a big part of the planned community engagement is making sure that we're doing this in public so that people can watch and see. And we get questions every single day in our inbox and we're putting those together and sending them back out. Then on top of that, the communications team will be working on some summary documents etc that we can present through the media or through other channels that parents use.

start time: 1581:41:20.000
end time: 1586:22:34.000
confidence: 0.88
D: You got more written? Yeah, I just like, also, like, kind of part of that question is like, are we hoping to solicit feedback from stakeholders? And like, if people do give us like feedback on these recommendations, how are those being considered? Do those actually have an impact on decisions?

start time: 1586:24:42.000
end time: 1597:39:40.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah, you know, the feedback from the public is always desirable, but our ability to go to the public and get feedback now, this is why I keep bringing up the timeline. I'll just go back to 2010. In 2010, when I was in Salem Kaiser, we had faced three years of numbers that started like 30 million and they went up significantly every year. A lot of companies did, families did, other public entities did. We had a whole 12 months to do community engagement and we did a lot of it. And we don't have 12 months. We've just got a few more weeks. At this point in time.

start time: 1598:22:00.000
end time: 1600:19:12.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Lasting is not a question, it's a statement. But I think I agree with everyone who's requested more specifics and also just.

start time: 1600:19:36.000
end time: 1601:19:44.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Like within that, like impact assessment, I.

start time: 1601:19:52.000
end time: 1603:25:52.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Feel like there's a lot of things here like, oh, we're cutting this, but it's not totally clear what those impacts actually are. Like, I know somebody mentioned the library systems and you and O. I already.

start time: 1603:26:16.000
end time: 1604:05:20.000
confidence: 0.85

start time: 1604:06:00.000
end time: 1604:31:40.000

B: Thank you.

start time: 1606:08:40.000
end time: 1609:55:18.000
confidence: 0.90
C: I just have a question about contracts. Probably to you, Dr. Adam, because we had talked at another meeting about evaluating the contract and is that happening?

start time: 1609:58:14.000
end time: 1625:45:46.000
confidence: 0.96
I: That is that will. We talked at the. That was at the audit committee In December. And so you were at that time, we were specifically talking about our community partner contracts for our culturally specific partners and implementing the audit. Implementing the audit recommendations from the 2020 audit. And so what we have said we will be able to do is have those. Those evaluations of services completed at the time where we're asking the board to vote on new contracts for those partners, because the contracts are ending this June 30th, and we currently have request proposal out for three more years. The next three years of contracts. We're doing it three years at a time. And so one of the audit recommendations was to anytime you put forth a new contract was to include a proposed new contract was to include evaluation of the services from the prior contract.

start time: 1625:46:58.000
end time: 1626:11:06.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And so we will be doing that.

start time: 1626:13:38.000
end time: 1627:26:30.000
confidence: 0.99
C: Okay, so that could be part of the reduction in cost.

start time: 1629:07:30.000
end time: 1635:08:30.000
confidence: 0.96
I: It is. You know, regarding my contracts, I made recommendations to Dr. Usk about the amount that is spent. And then that will. Then the board will then deliberate over all of that and all of the details, and we'll know in June how much we actually have to award to our community partners.

start time: 1635:23:30.000
end time: 1635:33:14.000

D: Okay.

start time: 1635:34:02.000
end time: 1636:07:38.000

C: So we kind of decided how much.

start time: 1636:08:34.000
end time: 1645:41:40.000
confidence: 0.97
I: Before we look at the evaluation it will have. My understanding, based on the budget timeline, is my team and I will have an amount that we're working with, given any amendments from the board that may happen. And so we will make a preliminary recommendation based on those amounts for the board to award moving forward. And when we make those proposed contractual amounts, we will include evaluation of services from the previous contract cycle. Thank you for the question.

D: But I made a world. But it had seven periods of 40 students each, except one. One was 42. We didn't have enough space in my room, so two students had to sit at my desk during that period. It was, you know, it was horrendous. So I'm curious about. As you're looking at these Numbers here we got, we got, you know, 10 million this year, 30 million, 31 million next year, and then potentially 70 something million the following year. You know, maybe this goes out to everyone else who's been around since 2010. You know, how does this, how does this compare to that?

start time: 1666:46:40.000
end time: 1692:07:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So I think rather than comparing it to a different district, it would be better for me to make observations about this particular district compared to the districts I've worked in. I think this is a very resource rich community. I think people are really smart, I think the employees are really talented. I think the students are fantastic. And it's also a community that wants a whole lot for the school district to deliver. There's resources here for restorative justice, there's resources here for social workers, for counselors. And you don't find those in a lot of Oregon districts and you don't find them in a lot of urban districts. The whole focus on the arts program and the variety of courses that we offer. But it's going to be a strained district because when you have these high expectations that go along with what we're used to having and now you have a reduction, it's going to create a strain. So we have to think about as we go through that, how do we want to feel about each other and what do we do about it, Right? So we can ask questions and I want you to do that. And we can say we agree with this decision. We don't agree with that decision. That's a part of the public private process. I don't always want you to do it, Eddie, but it's a part of the process. But at the end of the day, we got to get up and go to the next meeting and we've got to smile at each other and we got to welcome in the new superintendent and say, let's make this work. This is a great community. Let's make this work.

B: One of the things I noticed about the information shared tonight, that our central administration includes lots of direct and indirect school supports doesn't necessarily surprise me. I think it's something that we say a lot, but I think it's worth noticing in the data you present. And I think as we continue to have a community conversation, just reminding folks. So I sometimes, I think when we talk in generalities at a high level, PPS spends 6% on admin versus 4 versus 7, we lose the specifics about what's in there. And so I think, you know, you've pointed out a lot of what is in those numbers is both direct and indirect school supports. I think some of the things I wonder, I think one or two of the CBRC members ask similar questions. I think putting these numbers into context is going to be important. So, you know, when I see a 13 to 15 million dollars, you know, staff reduction in central, you know, administration, you know, out of, out of what?

start time: 1710:34:44.000
end time: 1710:37:32.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Right.

start time: 1710:37:56.000
end time: 1741:18:26.000
confidence: 0.95
B: What's the, what's the percentage there? When I see two million dollar contracts, again, you know, sort of out of what, what's the, what's the total body? So we can talk about that. And then just more generally the percentage reduction of that, you know, 15 to 17 million for central services, you know, versus the percentage reduction of the other 15 million for non central services. Because I think that helps put it in percentage perspective as well. So those are some things that I wonder. I know you don't have this tonight because again, maybe just as a reminder of the process, we don't even have your proposed budget yet. Right. This is the process that leads to that. And I don't remember the exact day we get that, but some of those details in there will be helpful, that context. But also what's our projected ending fund balance as part of this budget? Because I know that's going to be an important community conversation as well, where that, where that stands and, and how much we've, how much we are allocating in this budget to that maybe the last thing. Also, I don't know if we're going to go around again or not. Probably not. But I had the opportunity this weekend. Well, I know it's a little, I was at the council great city schools conference and yesterday, it's strange to say yesterday because it feels like a lot longer, but Secretary Cardona addressed us at lunch and Education Secretary, and what, you know, on the one hand it was inspiring because he talks about a lot of things going on and a lot of achievements in council great city schools districts. And you know, I will say I was even a little bit surprised that he specifically called out Portland for our growth and math scores, which beat almost every other beat the national average and most other large urban school districts, you know, in the country. So there were a lot of positives. And then I got real nervous when he talked about how the Biden administration's plan when it came to Esser funding.

B: This is the whole thing, Esser funding's ending and so all these districts, like we've spent most of it, there's a little bit more and then it's not going to be there. So There are a lot of questions about is the federal government going to step in? And his answer was no. His answer was that they are. And this is a quote, passing the baton to the states to take up that Esser funding. I reassured you, and really sort of see, like, what. What's been working that was funded, what do we need to continue funding? What are the supports that need to happen? And I just sat there thinking, I mean, it must be so easy from the federal level and, you know, admittedly very hard to pass anything from Congress. Very hard to do anything, but, you know, to just sort of say, like. And he said it optimistically, like, hey, we're passing the baton to the states.

B: And I thought, wow, even in one of the bluer states in the country with a Democratic governor and Democratic legislature, and we can't get anything above even current service level, much less anything that's going to backfill all those Esser funding. So that's just maybe the pretext of, you know, the conversation we need to keep having with the state legislature. But it actually made me pretty fearful because I don't see a path where our state comes through in a big way for us. Maybe we get some small wins, maybe. Which means that, you know, when we talk about what this looks like, you know, not just next year, but the year after, we got to think about really doing some things very differently.

C: Thanks for asking. It's really easy when you are working in school districts to know what the school people do because you see them every day. You know what the teachers do, you know what the aides do, you know what the bus drivers do, you know what the custodians do. It's really hard in a $2 billion business to know what this office does. So there is. There is a trust factor at some point. I mean, we know Dr. Bernard Adams, we know we like him and we know we trust him, but I don't really know how many people he not needs to get done what this district asks him to do. I definitely don't know how many electricians we need or how many plumbers we need. So I just wanted to put that out there because whenever we talk about central office budgets and school budgets, one of them we have a lot more insight into, and the other one we do not have as much insight into unless we've done those jobs ourselves, then we may have a little bit more insight.

B: And I'll just finish. I think the trust would verify. I think the questions from the community are completely legitimate. Say, what are those people doing? And we need to answer that. And everyone in this room knows my position on this. You know, I hate the, this, this, this gulf that gets sort of created that there are people doing good things for our students over here and people wasting time and money over here. The reality is these people are not wasting time and money. They are helping to run a school district, which these people doing the direct services cannot do their job without those other people. And so asking whether we have too many of those, it's a great question. It's totally on you. I'd say it's on me as well, but it's really on you and the staff to be able to say, like, like, look, this is, this is where we are and this is the impact. So the questions are good, but I wish we could move away from the good, bad dichotomy because I don't think, I don't think that helps us.

F: Ditto. Also, I was really curious about the percentages rather than the straight, you know, 15 to 17 million of out of. What's the denominator? Other wonderings I had were, you know, we know that the extras are important to academic outcomes. Art, music, dance, library. And those are facing cuts. And how will we, I'm just curious how we'll fare without those classes that we don't bring students, get students over the finish line. And with. Considering that, you know, we're concerned about academic outcomes, with all of the cuts that we're facing. Trying to read my own writing here. How will those outcomes land? How will these budget outcomes land in terms of academic. What's the impact they'll have on academic outcomes, specifically for the kids that are very far behind? And then to that end, does it make sense to focus on early literacy when we can really get a strong foundation for the students early on before there's too big of a gap to close? I also, Frankie, you mentioned about feedback from the community. It's going to be really important in the community too. Understand that we are curious to hear from them. And you're not going to see every comment that you made to a board member three times an email, you might not see that in a result. So I think being really clear, anytime you do engagement, like, we're taking in your feedback and we're not going to do anything with it, or we're curious about it and we're, we'll consider it if it makes sense to you know, within the context of what we have.

G: Okay, what did I notice about the information? It's high. It's very high level. And in the cuts year, high level is fine. Always when we're not cutting things because there's less scrutiny. But in a year there are cuts being made, more details about what's being cut and what impact it has on services, which is because I think conceptually, like, yeah, it could be fine with five positions. It's like, well, did you know that means, you know, X is going to happen and you'll have X impact. And I think we need to know that when we're looking at what positions are being cut, then the rest, the rest are wonderings. These are wonderings I've shared already. I'm wondering positions that are being cut, ones that are filled or unfilled positions.

Maybe not. But it seems like 2 million out of what I think is the denominator is not a lot. I wonder how this will crosswalk to the actual budget so that when we taking a PowerPoint and then having a crosswalk to the numbers and the actual budget because I think we have a very short period of time when that big document comes out to be able to then crosswalk changes to the, to the budget and being able to share with community members and make sense of it for them. Just it's going to be important here which we have cuts.

G: Wonder. And this I'm going to go. This is not necessarily material tonight, but I'm still wondering about the staffing cuts in the schools. And this is also about a community perception issue or the reality is, are the cuts positions in schools, are they because of enrollment changes or are they actually because we've changed the staffing formula? So for example, if a school lost 150 students, yes, they're going to lose staff not because we're making budget cuts, but because they just get a smaller allocation. And I think sometimes we have to make sense as like you might be losing seven positions, but five of them are because enrollment drop significantly and the other two are because we are making changes to support positions or whatever. But again, I think we need to sort of sort that out in a year in which we have declining because I, I wonder how I make sense of it.

I: Sure. If I could. Director Bermo was. I have a couple talking points there if that's helpful. So it's a little bit of a combination of both. At the elementary level, for example, we've reduced by 35 classroom teachers. 29 of those were enrollment driven and not driven by a slight increase by one in class size. At the middle school there's actually a little more staff because of the five to seven period day. And then at the high schools we made some slight adjustments to the rate again that will bump up class size and change the student teacher ratio a little bit. But you are. It is a combination of both of those things. But at gale mentary level, the classroom or homeroom teachers is mostly an enrollment driven production.

end time: 1911:36:30.000
confidence: 0.91
G: I think it's always better just to let me share more details because I think an enrollment reduction is much easier to understand. And then it becomes a smaller group that we're actually. These are the impacts that are happening because of the budget cuts because we have a compounding set of issues that are reducing staff. And it's all being attributed in some ways to the 30 million in cuts versus raw fund and defining. So even if we had more money and we had to find new enrollments, still we'd probably have those cuts. I'm wondering also still about this goes back to the staffing piece about the special endpoints and then and how to and this is a little bit of feedback we're getting so far. How we're going to share with parents or assure them that students with really significant challenges or supports that they're getting how they're going to still get.

start time: 1931:42:20.000
end time: 1947:11:40.000
confidence: 0.93
I: That's a great question. And so an example I can offer are the instructional interventionists that we prioritized. We looked at student performance data and I think Chief Bruno shared during one of the curricular presentations that we're seeing some promising results from some schools that were utilizing the interventionists appropriately to help students increase their math and reading performance. And so we looked at, for example, schools that had. We looked at proportions of students who were performing below grade level expectations based on map data and assigned interventionist FTE and allocations because of that, in order to support increased and accelerated performance in reading and math. So that's just an example that I added off the top of my head. But, you know, you send that in, we could probably give you some more detailed responses. I don't know if Chief's here.

I don't know if they are separated between consulting contracts versus building maintenance contracts versus, you know, any other type of contracts. But one of my questions would be is there more cuts in those contracts that could be used to offset cuts and stuff like that and things like that? I guess once we get specifics, we can kind of look at. Kind of look at that. But I don't know. You guys have all to know things.

Those are generally not what we're talking about with respect to this $2 million of contracts we're focusing. All of this content is focused, focused on the operating budget, especially the general fund, which is separate and apart from all of the school building modernizations, the bond.

Did you think grant for this question first? Like, right. If we didn't use bond Funds to use for grant, but we use general funds. Those type of expenses is what I want to see if we can get that kind of distinction.

They are using capital fund dollars, especially bonds. But as Dan mentioned, there are some limited. There are some limited sources of non bond funds for capital projects, but all of that is. Is separate from general fund operating dollars.

D: Can I just respond really quickly to a couple of the questions that board members raised. One is on the issue of the proportions, so the 15 million and 15 million, what is the proportion of the denominator rounding a bit. That 15 million represents about 2% of the school based budgets and about 6% of the central budgets. So there is a difference in terms of the relative amounts of the denominators that we're talking about. And then on the question of the ending, the projected ending balance for the end of next year, this is included we have a number of slides that are in an appendix. So in one of those slides, I think it's the last one. Might be the very last one. We're organizing to maintain about a $42 million ending fund balance at the end of next year. And that's really linked to the 5% reserve.

start time: 2039:24:30.000

So it would be safe to try to save those now and to see what happened with the legislature, what to do. 25:26.

B: We've been having a conversation and it actually came up our student representative. I'm sorry, I forgot your name, but you raised a really good question around process. And I think it's just to sort of, sort of highlight. And you talked about where we are, but it's challenging in this budget because of, you know, of how we got here. And the reality, perfect world said this, we would have spent the fall sort of talking, having community meetings, talking to the board, talking to folks and sort of, you know, preparing the groundwork and saying, hey, you know, we could cut here, we could here, we could cut here. And then, you know, ultimately the superdent forward, you know, because we didn't. We didn't know sort of the magnitude of the cuts till roughly December. It's been on an accelerated timeline. As a board member, I've been asking her the question of, wait a minute, what flexibility do I have here? And the reality is we have lots of flexibility if we want to take it, but the implications are pretty serious. And we've got collective bargaining agreements that we need to uphold and respect. And so those collective bargaining agreements are one of the reasons why staff have been notified. And I don't even understand all the details there, but it's like why staff have been notified of things that if we undo those things, I mean, adding a person back is actually easy, but changing that person and taking someone else away gets very, very challenging. And so, I mean, I'll just say that's frustrating to me as a board member. I also completely understand why we are where we are. And so that in some ways, like I'm in my mind beginning to sort of separate out between what are the, what are the immediate things looking at this budget that we want to say as our priorities and changes we want to make. And then maybe what are some longer term things that we might want to say that maybe we can't get to that at the beginning of the school year because of, you know, again, just all the, you know, contracts and everything else that, you know, we need to uphold, but that maybe in the long run we want to give direction, which will probably be to the next superintendent, about where we want to go. So I just put that out there because that's something I'm struggling with as a board member. And if CDRC is also thinking about that, you could also think about what are sort of the short term things and what are some Longer term recommendations you might have.

Because when I'm hearing things about, like, library cuts and like, cutting like a significant amount of, like, library assistance, potentially, like all of them, and also cutting our moving library staff as well, and like actually having libraries closed in all schools for a portion of every week sounds very, like, I don't even think we need to measure the impact. I think that's very, you know, you can see it right there. And so I'm thinking, like, when we're thinking about things like that, like, how is that ever aligning with the board's values and commitments? And if it is, like, do those commitments need to be reassessed? Because I feel like if we're talking about things like updating curriculum, how are we, like, can we reallocate that money to the organizational fund and then use that money to make sure that our libraries are open so that students can actually read books? And, you know, I think that the education, you know, it should be updated. That is something that's very important. But we're talking about, like, closing libraries. Like, I feel like those things should be open. So house sense budget and, you know, can it be changed?

B: But, like, no, closing libraries is not consistent where we want. I also think realistically we can't balance this budget without reducing staff. And so it really becomes a question of where are those staff reductions and where do they do the least harm? Every staff reduction will do harm. In my mind, it's where it does the least harm. I don't know. And the superintendent team could talk more about what those specific library reductions, does it mean getting rid of library? Does it mean cutting back on hours? I guess to your question, though, about the changes, yes, we could add library assistance back, but in order to balance, we'd have to find that somewhere else. If we found that in other staff. Cheryl, correct me if I'm wrong, we can't. There's a timeline issue there. We can't sort of change our minds in May or June and say, well, actually we're going to reassign you, but now we're Going to tell other people that they're unassigned because we missed the timelines for that. If we were able to find that in contracts or curriculum or somewhere else, we might be able to shift it again. You heard me say earlier, I think those things have an impact as well. So that's kind of the. I mean that's really the trade off, I think as we go through the budget process that we're doing. I sort assume you're gonna. So I just.

D: Just for specifics because I do understand that cuts need to be made, but can it be? Can we reallocate more money to educational fund? Is that a possibility? Can we make cuts in. In other funds and deficit of the 30 million?

F: I've had a couple of conversations in the last few weeks with people that would be interested in partnering with our district that are. That could be considered community partners. One of them is the Multnomah County Library because they're not closing. And the other one is don't judge. I met somebody at a Bravo orchestra concert a couple of weeks ago. Orchestra that teaches low income kids in North Portland how to play an instrument and play together. Someone from all classical radio that has K12 curriculum that they would love to, you know, share. It's free. I don't know much about it, but I'm starting to. I'm feeling that this is an opportunity for us to be really creative and to partner. Consider partnering with others.

B: I know the challenge you wanted to finish up, but. And I meant to say this earlier around my questions, but I also been having this conversation with superintendent Medicaid funding. This has come up in an article in OPB last last fall. I know people online are sort of asking the question about it as well. I actually had an opportunity to chat with council great city schools about this because the federal government has made changes that make it easier to bill Medicaid and it turned out I didn't even know this, that the district already has a task force or a work team that's sort of reviewing the issue. We bill it for a very small amount right now, but we're sort of looking at whether we can do that. To be really clear, that's adding administrative positions, but that administrative positions should more than pay for themselves if we're successful. Right. And essentially that's billing, you know, for services we're already providing to students who are Medicaid eligible in our schools that didn't used to be allowed, but the federal government has made it easier. And actually they. Secretary Cardona said that that's an explicit goal is to make that a more consistent stream of funding out to public school districts. So we need to do everything we can to get a share of that to pay for services already paying for.

A: And just to be clear, though, that's not going to happen in the next few weeks. So I just want to, I want to put it out there like that's something that we want to be able to grab, you know, the next couple weeks or in this budget cycle. But that is something adding to the next next year. We can look at additional revenues for.

I: So thanks CGRC members and board members for allowing us to use this structure with our conversation and discussion tonight. I think we've had a lot of really thoughtful and insightful noticings and wonderings. I'm going to turn it back over to Deputy Lee to go through our next steps in the timeline as we move forward through the budget approval and adoption process.

D: Thank you. So this is the last slide, by the way. Thank everybody, all my colleagues who are here changing Alexandra Martin. Alexandra is the primary staff liaison to the cbrc. So thank you for all your work and so many other colleagues here. Thank you, everybody. This is just a quick summary of some of the key dates that are upcoming over the next couple of months. So you already mentioned the community information sessions that are still being designed and will be scheduled soon. Also, the April 23 board meeting is when the recommended budget superintendent's recommended budget will be shared. Then there are several events in May, continued community engagement. CBRC will present their report and make a presentation to the board on May 7. There's the budget calendar has a tentative hold for another work session on May 14, and that will be followed one week later by the approved. The date of the approved budget vote by the board, the last day in June is more of a technical requirement, but an important one for the TSCC to adopt the budget in combination with the board's formal adoption of the budget. That's what we have for tonight. Thank you so much for all your questions. We are working on trying to respond and prepare follow up responses to the questions that you shared tonight as well as prior to tonight. And please stay tuned. We'll try to respond as we go, but we also know that we have a lot of details to share back with the community, CBRC and our nebronic community. It's coming soon.
