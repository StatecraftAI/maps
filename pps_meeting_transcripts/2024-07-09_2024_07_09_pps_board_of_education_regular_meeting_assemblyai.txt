A: All right. This public regular meeting of the Board of education for July 9, 2024 is called to order. All items being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the Board and meetings tab. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV's services website and on channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. So please check the district website for replay times. Good evening and welcome to the first meeting of 2425 school year. I'll be chairing this evening meeting as chair Hollins is not able to join us in person, but he's out there. And Director Sullivan is also joining us this evening. And for her, I understand it's like 3 o'clock in the morning. So her level of dedication and commitment is on a whole nother level. And I just want to personally say thank you so much for joining us to the both of y'all. I don't know that I love this board that much. I don't know that I would have showed up. So I appreciate y'all so, so, so, so very much. Before we get started tonight, I'd like to take a few moments to acknowledge the loss of. Of two individuals who passed away in the recent weeks while at one of our schools. And if it's okay with the rest of my colleagues, I'd like to take this moment to. We have some cards here that I'd like to pass around. And before we do that, I'd like to just take one moment in honor and recognizing those.

He was always willing to go out in the middle of the night and board up windows or drive through the snow or do whatever was needed to ensure that the staff and our students could return to their schools the next day. His dedication and genuine love for his work and for those that he worked with was clear. So our heartfelt condolences go out to.

They came back from a pandemic. You know, they came back from a strike, and they're still here. And I'd like to thank all of our students for their hard work, and I look forward to connecting with all of our students and building a better relationship with our affinity groups, our student councils across PPs and the broader student body here.

A: In any case, In May of 2021, the board adopted a process by which board members could be considered for board leadership positions. This resolution states that in order to be considered for leadership position, board members must notify the board manager in writing by June 1st if they plan to run for the board leadership, which is then voted on by board members at the first board meeting in June. Both Director Wang and I have expressed an interest in being considered for the board chair. Directors Brim Edwards and DePass have indicated that they would like to be considered for the board Vice chair. So since we have more than one board member interested in each of the board leadership positions, we will take a voice vote for each of the positions, with each board member stating their vote. The same process will be followed in deciding who will be the next board Vice chair. So we're going to go down the room and then we'll begin the vote for the board chair. And then when I state your name, can you please indicate your vote for the board chair? Director Scott for Board chair.

E: Thank you, Director Green, Chair Green, for this meeting. I just want to take a moment. I don't want to let the moment pass without thanking you both, you as the Vice Chair and Chair Hollins, for your work this year. Having in my 11th year on the board, you know, some years are easier than others. And I would say this is one of our most challenging years we've had, from the historic strike to reaching a settlement, passing a local option which provides $100 million a year to our students, keeping us together as a board, focused on our students, bringing into our board meetings the joy of bringing in the joy of middle school. I think that's quite a saying something. And I think the thing I appreciated most is just the laser focus of remembering the students who PPs haven't served well and keeping our resources, our focus, our commitment, our passion for them. And I think the two of you did that day in and day out through this year. So I really want to thank both of you for your service and your leadership this past year.

I absolutely love and respect each and every one of you, but I do want to make something very clear, you know, and this is to the public and to anybody else that's watching. Just because we have split vote here, I want everybody to be understanding and very clear that just because we have a Once the vote is done, we are all together as one and we are a team of nine. And I said team of nine because I'm including the superintendent and our student rep as well. So I just want to make sure for the public, for everyone else who's watching, once the vote is done, we are a unified group and we are together no matter what. So once again, thanks, everyone.

J: Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate that. And before I jump in it, I just. I also want to echo everyone and say thank you. I know that the most important job that you all have as board members is hiring a superintendent. And so how lucky Was I to be selected by the board and knowing the role that chair and vice chair played in that I will always hold close. So for. Thank you for that. And then I just wanted to add before I jump in, you know, in addition to remembrance for Craig and Sam, we also lost another head custodian from Rose City park, and that's John Morrison. And that was just last week, July 1st. And so sorry you didn't have that update. So don't feel bad about missing it. We didn't get that to you. But just know we have a card for that family as well. And then that's in addition to three, two former and one current student. But because they're minors, I'm not going to say their name, but I just want to say that we're starting off this academic year July 1, in remembrance of those who served and also thinking forward about those we need to continue to serve. So thank you for that. So I'm excited. My first superintendent's report of the season and I want to start off with appreciations. I had the opportunity to get around and about. And so for the June leadership celebration, being in community with our district leaders was so amazing. The welcome event at King elementary on June 5th was wonderful and we had a chance to see it play out on news for about six days in a row. But it's okay. I'm always happy to have a slow news week. Right. That means that there's not a lot of horrible things happening. So that's good. And then finally having the opportunity to attend a conference with other leaders focused on females in the leadership role and recognizing the lift that we have ahead of us. So just wanting to express appreciations and then also to let you all know what I'll be up to through the month of July, I put a couple of quick points. I'll not read them all to you, but as you can imagine, meet and greets one on ones, lots of planning, strategizing, collaborating, hiring, making sure that we are paying attention to the initiatives that we need to have in place to raise student achievement and really dig into our student data and our performance matrix. So that's July for Dr. Armstrong. Also, I had the opportunity selfie credit to Julia Bremen Edwards. I had the opportunity to sit down with each of you for about an hour and talk through some of the priorities and your hopes and dreams as a governance team and then what you bring to the work. And there were some things themes that emerged and so I'm happy to share those themes with you. Really six. The first was Communication. As you can imagine, thinking further about ways that we establish transparency, the ways in which we utilize those one on one meetings to really get at being unified and coherent and have the clarity that we need to do the work on behalf of students. Relationships was definitely a key theme. And not only relationships amongst this team, but relationships with our labor partners, our community organizations, our students and our staff. And so that's a priority. Theme three, financial health. You all seem to be pretty passionate about not only monitoring and being clear on our priorities here in the district, but the ways in which we're going to lean into conversation at the state level and helping to make sure that we're able to fund to provide the service that we need to provide. Theme four, board governance. Improving the effectiveness, addressing issues, realizing that each of you brings strengths together. You're a team and we're a team, as Director Holland says of nine. So just really appreciating that. Of course, monitoring and reporting. You all seem to have some passion and interests around making sure that our benchmarks are clear and that we're updating people along the way. Right. So it's not just an internal document, but it's external facing. And then of course, engagement. And not only engagement and community. Community, but the ways in which we think about Portland as a place of choice, not only for our families to send kiddos, but for adults who choose to work for us. And so really being clear about the culture and the support that needs to happen so that we not only hire, but we retain the people who choose to be with us. So those were the themes that emerged. I am continuing conversations with leadership and other partners and as I pull more themes together, we'll have a chance to have conversations around that. It will seed a lot of the work that will go into our annual work plan. But I just wanted you all to be able to see how things landed for the team. The other thing I'd love to talk about is Summer Acceleration Academy. We are in the summer of 2024. We have 12 sites, 11 hub sites, and then one OCLE program that isn't considered a hub, but 12 in total. And just a couple of key bullet points for you to know, really focusing on literacy, prioritizing enrollment for historically underserved students, embedding DLI and E ELD newcomer programs. So language development and then early kindergarten transition programs at nine of the hub sites. Transportation is provided, breakfast and lunch and snacks are provided, all free, no cost. And there's afternoon enrichment programs. Thank you to our partners who run those programs. After the SAA program ends at about 1. Just so you can see on the right side, you can see what a day looks like with literacy as the main focus. But of course, math, science, technology, and bringing in some blocks for enrichment and enough time for lunch as well. And know that the team that are supporting our licensed reading specialists, and they're making sure that Those groups are small, 15 is the cap. So that we can make sure that all students receive the time and attention that they need just to see it at a glance. I created this map so that you can see the regions just from a macro view. And so right now, we have 2,401 students enrolled. And in the first week. So we've only had three days. So.
