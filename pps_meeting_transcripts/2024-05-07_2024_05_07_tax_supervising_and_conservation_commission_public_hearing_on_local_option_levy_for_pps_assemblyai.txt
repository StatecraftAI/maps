A: Welcome. I'll call to order this public hearing on May 7, 2024 for the Portland Public Schools Local Option Levy tax measure. I am Harmony Quitos. I'm the chair of the Tax Supervising and Conservation Commission. Welcome, everyone. Just as a reminder, the TSCC is a community oversight commission established by the Oregon legislature more than 100 years ago. The commission oversees the budgets of all TSCC member taxing districts and annually conducts a thorough budget review and certification process. Another of TSC's responsibilities, as detailed in state law, is to hold public hearings on all property tax measures proposed by municipal corporations under the commission's jurisdiction. So, like this one, TSCC holds public hearings to give the public an opportunity to learn more about the proposed measure. We ask questions that we think a typical community member might ask. In that sense, we are here today to represent those community members who may not be able to ask questions to you directly. We encourage community members to attend these public hearings and make comments and ask questions. Minutes of this public hearing will be prepared and retained as a permanent record of the proceedings. TSCC does not take any action on the proposed tax measure and does not advocate for a position on the measure. This hearing is strictly to promote information sharing. I'll now ask my fellow commissioners and the staff to introduce themselves. Which way you want to start? Sure. Hi.

A: We'll go ahead and dive into questions and those of you if you're going to share, just introduce yourselves when you when it's your turn to speak. And Allison, you have our first question.

start time: 73:02:32.000
end time: 80:39:40.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Thanks. I also forgot to mention I have a third and a fifth grader in the immersion program at Atkinson Elementary. So, first question is. So a recent report to the Community Budget Review Committee shows that the levy supports 851 positions in fiscal year 2223. Yet the ballot measure estimates that the Levy will support 660 positions on average going forward. Could you please share with us why that number of supported positions is expected to decrease?

start time: 81:06:40.000
end time: 105:16:20.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Thank you so much for the question. Commissioner positions are based on funding available and there are two primary reasons that the number of positions funded by the levy has decreased. Our initial revenue projection for the levy that was completed in 2019 showed that the levy supported 819 position or 851 positions. However, the real estate market is very different than it was four years ago. Based on our most accurate assessed valuation and compression trends from the Multnomah County Economist, the revised estimate is approximately $11 million less than originally projected. The initial estimate was 116.9 million and the new estimate is 106 million. Less revenue means that we can fund fewer positions. Additionally, the salaries, benefits and cost per teacher in the district has also increased since 2019. Now, the projected average teacher salary, benefits and total compensation costs for the district is 147,345 per full time employee. For reference during the fiscal year 2022-23, there was $106.5 million collected by the local option levy and the average cost teacher cost was 125,161 which enabled us to fund the 851 positions.

start time: 105:46:50.000
end time: 109:27:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Thank you. I have a follow up to that. The ballot measure also indicates the funds will be used for teachers and education support. Could you give us like a percentage breakdown of how funds will be used? Like how many teachers versus institution support?

start time: 109:46:50.000
end time: 129:19:30.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So PPS has not proposed a specific percentage for classroom teachers versus classroom support staff for the first or other years of this levy renewal. These are decisions that will be made by the school board when approving the district's budget each year. However, in the PPS School Board Resolution Number 6589 which referred the levy to the ballot, the board did commit that levy revenue shall be used to fund teaching positions at every school in the district ensuring students have access to a well rounded education with many equitable enrichments for elementary and middle grades and focus electives that help prepare high school students for career or College including CTE programs and science, technology, engineering and math or STEM programs as part of the 25 2025-26 school year budget. The levy revenue could also fund the classroom support positions across the district which would include educational assistance, reading specialists, sped, special education certified personnel to help identify students with mental or behavioral health needs, academic issues or other needs.

start time: 129:39:10.000
end time: 133:11:18.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And just one last thing in terms of like those actual positions, how does a district determine how they're spread out versus like regionally or per school or how do they positions that were funded.

start time: 133:11:34.000
end time: 133:49:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: By the levy across the different schools.

start time: 134:36:30.000
end time: 135:05:58.000
confidence: 0.67
D: I do not share.

start time: 135:08:14.000
end time: 138:06:42.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I'm happy to answer that that question. So we we based on just kind of going across all of like the.

start time: 138:07:06.000
end time: 138:45:06.000
confidence: 1.00
A: Average teachers across all the whole district.

start time: 138:47:38.000
end time: 143:58:30.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So we do post teachers all into the general fund and then modify it with posting as on an average basis of all teacher costs to that local option levy calculation.

start time: 144:06:50.000
end time: 145:54:54.000
confidence: 1.00
A: So it is something that is done each year based on actual costs so.

start time: 145:55:02.000
end time: 146:54:38.000
confidence: 1.00
B: That we are being true to not.

start time: 146:55:34.000
end time: 148:50:50.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Not selecting one lower cost or higher cost teacher. Just kind of an average across the district.

start time: 149:10:30.000
end time: 149:20:30.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Thank you.

start time: 149:21:10.000
end time: 154:36:44.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Can I ask a. Can I just for my own clarification. So it's a, it's basically an equal distribution among all schools. It's like a percent of the FTE at a given school is funded by the, by the local option levy funds. Yes, we do have an equity formula.

start time: 154:37:32.000
end time: 155:41:32.000
confidence: 0.92
B: In staffing, but the fund, so the.

start time: 155:41:56.000
end time: 158:12:12.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Funding for all staffing comes from both the, you know, state school fund, property taxes, local option levy. So we are, we do have an.

start time: 158:12:36.000
end time: 158:53:16.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Equity component in our budget already built.

start time: 158:53:48.000
end time: 162:01:54.000
confidence: 0.98
A: In, in the staffing formula. But the how much is funded from each source of fund is more done on an average basis. Thank you. Go ahead.

start time: 162:03:22.000
end time: 162:09:06.000
confidence: 0.78
D: Great.

start time: 162:10:18.000
end time: 168:13:32.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Okay. Thank you. And Lisa, I think you just touched on this a little bit already. But the ballot measure specifically calls out having resources for students to be college or career ready. What does or will that look like in practical terms? If you could give some examples. And will there be specific metrics tied to that goal and how the funds are utilized?

start time: 168:16:26.000
end time: 189:59:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Sure. So this is a question for me. Good afternoon again. So we do track college and career readiness, and we present those data to the board annually along with our graduation data. We don't calculate that metric until after students have graduated. And for example, for the class of 2023, 69% of that class was deemed to be college and career readiness. And so part of your question was, what all goes into that? Well, first and foremost, our teachers are great facilitators of learning and help support students becoming college and career readiness through the various courses that they take. And so some of those indicators that we look for are students who successfully complete three or more AP courses, three or more IB courses, three or more dual credit courses. Students who successfully complete a CTE pathway are also considered college and career ready. And we also look at students who attain the seal of biliteracy and students who reach college and career readiness scores or indicators on any of those college and career readiness assessments, like the SAT or the ACT or the psat. So there are a variety of ways that students can demonstrate their college and career readiness, and we're tracking all of those.

start time: 190:15:30.000
end time: 190:38:34.000
confidence: 0.98
A: So is that ongoing?

start time: 190:39:22.000
end time: 193:11:58.000
confidence: 0.96
B: That's something you've been doing for some period of time. It's not. Or is this a new initiative relative to the new authorization of the levy?

start time: 193:13:34.000
end time: 196:44:10.000
confidence: 0.97
D: So we've been doing this since at least before I got here, and I've been here about three years now, three school years, and it was already something that the board had great interest in and wanted a report on annually when I, when I arrived. And we've Continued that.

start time: 196:53:10.000
end time: 199:24:28.000
confidence: 0.94
B: And if I could ask a question that really wasn't on the. On my list. So is this more targeted then towards, I assume, secondary education students?

start time: 199:25:24.000
end time: 200:23:56.000
confidence: 0.93
D: High school students? Yes, we're talking about high school students.

start time: 200:25:08.000
end time: 200:30:52.000
confidence: 0.75
A: Yeah.

start time: 200:31:56.000
end time: 202:10:20.000
confidence: 0.90
B: So when you're talking about distributing resources from the operating levy, does this just.

start time: 202:11:00.000
end time: 203:01:16.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Become part of that equitable distribution, although.

start time: 203:01:48.000
end time: 204:18:00.000
confidence: 0.97
B: The emphasis will be on those kinds of programs or that sort of.

start time: 205:01:40.000
end time: 205:34:36.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Instruction for the high school students?

start time: 205:35:48.000
end time: 205:46:40.000
confidence: 0.86
D: Yes.

start time: 206:05:50.000
end time: 207:43:02.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So it doesn't really affect the balance of how the resources from the levy would be distributed among all your school?

start time: 207:44:46.000
end time: 208:59:30.000
confidence: 0.89
D: No, no. As Ms. Hertz had explained, it's across the average teacher cost.

start time: 209:44:30.000
end time: 227:27:50.000
confidence: 0.97
A: So I think continuing on that. So this ballot measure specifically mentions college and career readiness, and then it also this year adds support for mental health, something that has not been included in previous local option levy language. Can you talk a little bit about how these funds will be used specifically to support student mental health? And maybe I'll clarify the question a little bit to try and get what we're asking. Right. The levy is telling us as voters and taxpayers that when we support the levy and vote. Yes. And that money goes to the district, these things come out of it. And we're just curious how you're measuring or if it's more part of the whole district goal and vision. Just to try and clarify. Sure. And I'll respond to that. So the district supports all students access to high quality teaching and learning through safe and affirming environments that are supported and embedded by embedded social emotional learning and restorative justice. So we, we know the needs of our students have grown since the pandemic.

start time: 227:30:30.000
end time: 228:05:42.000
confidence: 0.98
B: And the levy provides critical funding to.

start time: 228:06:06.000
end time: 228:52:34.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Support students through a comprehensive approach to.

start time: 228:54:22.000
end time: 229:46:02.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Academic and mental health and social emotional challenges.

start time: 229:48:26.000
end time: 230:40:42.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So specifically, the levy funds teachers who.

start time: 230:41:06.000
end time: 233:07:22.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Receive professional learning to deliver trauma informed social emotional learning curriculum every day in the classroom. And so that that directly supports a.

start time: 233:07:46.000
end time: 233:37:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Healing centered school community.

start time: 233:46:10.000
end time: 238:16:14.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And so we measure the impact of these investments in mental health and behavioral health and the impact of the trauma informed social emotional learning and restorative justice instruction through our annual administration of our successful school survey, looking at our disciplinary.

start time: 238:17:02.000
end time: 240:25:18.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Referrals and through our mental health referral data. I get it.

start time: 240:26:14.000
end time: 241:16:50.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Yeah, go ahead. It all comes back to the teachers. Yeah.

start time: 241:47:50.000
end time: 242:15:30.000
confidence: 0.89
D: I was a teacher myself.

start time: 242:23:50.000
end time: 245:52:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So can I just as a follow. So you mentioned since the pandemic the need has increased. Are you seeing now that the pandemic is aging out a little bit? Are you seeing maybe an improvement in terms of.

start time: 246:31:10.000
end time: 254:29:22.000
confidence: 0.97
A: I think we continue to see that our students have significant Need. In addition to that, I think our teachers are continuing to demonstrate the capacity to respond to that need because of the additional resources and training that we're investing in them to support students. Okay, so enrollment has increased in recent years, which is a trend all over.

start time: 254:29:46.000
end time: 254:51:10.000
confidence: 0.99
D: The country, I think.

start time: 255:21:30.000
end time: 256:09:50.000
confidence: 1.00
A: What trends are you projecting in the years to come?

start time: 256:18:50.000
end time: 257:30:42.000
confidence: 0.97
D: If enrollment continues to decrease, is it.

start time: 257:33:46.000
end time: 258:58:40.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Possible that you'll need fewer teachers? And then if you need fewer teachers.

start time: 259:04:20.000
end time: 274:13:30.000
confidence: 0.97
D: How would that impact your spending of these levy funds? Sure, happy to answer that. Thank you for the question. The trends, of course, and projections can change, but as of now, we get our enrollment projections from the Population Resource center at Portland State University, and they're projecting that our enrollment will continue to decline for at least the next nine years before it flattens and then starts to slowly increase again. However, the cost of providing education continue to increase every year, year over year, and the number of positions funded by the local option levy has reduced over time. If the enrollment declines continue as projected, we may need fewer teachers. But because those average costs associated with teachers continue, with their salaries and benefits continue to rise, the library becomes even more important. In order to maintain the workforce, we need to support our students.

start time: 275:03:50.000
end time: 275:24:14.000
confidence: 0.97
A: One follow up.

start time: 275:25:42.000
end time: 277:17:02.000
confidence: 0.99
D: So I guess is there a point in your projections or stress testing that.

start time: 277:20:06.000
end time: 278:06:22.000
confidence: 0.99
A: You would consider going out for a.

start time: 278:06:46.000
end time: 278:56:50.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Lower levy amount than just a renewal?

start time: 279:11:50.000
end time: 299:38:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I think that would be hard to predict right now. Not knowing what's going to go on with state funding, not knowing what's going to go on with enrollments, other needs. You know, I was tempted to the question of are we, two years after the pandemic, starting to see change in students, mental health issues? I don't know that it's going to be that clean. I think there are other factors that are influencing students mental health. We've had quite a bit of chatter recently about access to social media of students and how that's impacting especially preteens, younger teenagers, especially girls. And so I think we have to keep monitoring what's going on in our community, what are the expectations for the community in terms of student results, and then weighing those decisions on an annual basis. And I will say the short time I've been here or the long time I've been watching you as from afar. This district and this board are doing an excellent job of using data to make those decisions. And you can do some predicting, you know, you can say nine years out and then you know that sometimes things change and you get, get a chance to readjust some of your thinking at that time.

start time: 300:05:40.000
end time: 301:50:36.000
confidence: 0.90
D: Yeah, yeah, because part of that's also a political question. And I'll just say as an individual.

start time: 301:51:08.000
end time: 302:27:08.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Board member, no, I wouldn't be interested.

start time: 302:27:24.000
end time: 302:51:08.000
confidence: 0.94
D: In reducing the levy until the state.

start time: 302:52:04.000
end time: 303:19:24.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Fully funds education in Oregon.

start time: 303:20:12.000
end time: 307:36:14.000
confidence: 0.95
D: So I think if the state were to step up and funded the quality education model, we can certainly have a conversation with our taxpayers about whether we can reduce the local burden. But the main reason why that exists is because of the higher cost of running the school district in Portland and the fact that the state doesn't adequately fund schools. So when that happens, we can have.

start time: 307:36:22.000
end time: 308:11:26.000
confidence: 0.93
B: That conversation, but I don't see that happening soon.

start time: 308:12:38.000
end time: 310:12:30.000
confidence: 0.91
D: So I don't personally support. Thank you.

start time: 310:14:30.000
end time: 323:37:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I think we're going to. We're going to direct this question to the board, but staff feel free to weigh in. We're happy to have any input. But as the elected decision makers for our school district, you know that the district has faced a number of challenges. We've talked already about the pandemic. There was a significant teacher strike this year and then add layers of students, mental health and all the things that we face as parents and community members and students face every day in the classroom. But we've seen big things in Portland as well. And we want to know what this district is doing, what you're doing, or what you think the next steps are to kind of rebuild confidence with voters that the district is heading in the right direction and it's a.

D: But I think one of the things that one we've done is when starting hiring Our entrance superintendent, Dr. Huss, who has been challenged with trying to rebuild, you know, the trust with our union leaders, our staff and the community. And I think part of that is that, you know, we have to recognize this is not just a PPS thing. Right. There's been unprecedented challenges over the last few years for all of our districts and working. And so with doing that and building trust, one's communication has been great. Having Director Scott had did a town hall a while back that had got great reviews. So I think for us as board members, getting out, talking with the community, working with our staff is a way to start building that trust back with the community. Other folks can speak up if they like as well.

B: Yeah, I'd like to just add to that. I'm a new board member, so I'm trying to get out to the schools and just see what's going on. I mean, I taught at one school in PPS and that's one school in PPS that doesn't let you know what's really going on everywhere. And I'm retired so I can go in during the day and I've done a little bit of volunteering and I've gone in when teachers ask for board members to come see what's going on. And it's really been amazing. I see what the students are having to deal with. I see what the teachers are having to deal with. I see the challenges I see and that's been exciting for me. I mean, I don't know how many people I affect since I'm only kind of letting tool, but I'm also going visits with the chiefs of staff when they go see the principals. And I'm getting much better feel for the whole district. The other day I had an opportunity to attend a town hall at Freshman and the students were about maybe 30 of them discussing problems they were having and ways they thought that the school could be better for them. And it was amazing their ideas. It's just made me realize what a wonderful place it is and the diversity we have here. So when we're talking about money, which I guess will hear, I can see that, you know, we need more teachers, we need more aides. This levy helps a lot. But it's the QEM that we have to do and we have to work together. And I just think we all have to get out there as much as we can. Nobody else on this board can get out like I can because they're working. But just the more we can go to events that we're invited to and the more time we spend together and I think we all know our goal is just to do what's best for the kids and we can exclude talk about that together and not argue about, you know, what we all know time and unfortunately money and skill and try to let people know we appreciate that. I'm going to speak up since I'm Julia Brim Edwards. My board service has spanned three decades.

B: It's a good thing of timing to make that happen. And I had 10 years between my second first and second term. So I've seen a lot in PPS. I've seen big enrollment drops. I've seen us have $100,000 in or less in our reserves. Came in right after the water crisis. And I think PPS is really well positioned right now and positioned to rebuild confidence. I think, you know, Covid was something that impacted all districts around the country and certainly the strike was hard on families. I just go back to what students experience every day in our classroom. Our public schools offer amazing opportunities for kids and neighborhoods across the city. We have excellent teaching. I think the board is focused. We have a set of board goals that we've been focused on, very committed to, even through, through Covid. We align our resources, we make data driven decisions which I think parents can see that we're trying to move as much resources as close to the classroom as possible. We have lots of community events. I mean, now that we're out of COVID strike's over. We're having so many opportunities to celebrate our students. We had arts alive recently where you had thousands of kids at the art museum basically showing their brilliance in whatever their art form was. We recently celebrated two amazing basketball teams that were placed in the top state tournament. We were recognizing tonight our constitution teams which are always nationally competitive. And so there is a lot for sports students and families to look at with pride and to see what the value they get out of our public schools. And I think we just need to continue to communicate about that and also as we enter into the another top budget year, continue to focus our resources on our students and be very transparent even when we're making very difficult decision. So to me, that's the way that I think we build back, we build trust with our community and with our staff.

A: A follow up. So a lot of I'm a parent, I'm pta, I've been in the boundary Coalition, cbrc. Right. Like, I show up, I'm here. And a lot of the events we're talking about are people who are already engaged in the system. Right. Like, and not necessarily right. Often new kids are participating and all of that. There's a lot of families who have disengaged from the district over the last certainly since 2020 and Covid. But I hear it talking to parent friends, I hear it with parents who have preschoolers and thinking about kindergarten and that conversation, where's my kid gonna go? And I'm curious what work the district is doing to either re engage families, folks who have opted out or, you know, left the district but still are here in our communities. Right. Those capture rates, depending on where you are in the district are quite low or trying to encourage those, you know, the preschoolers and you know, to come back to come into our public school system. I mean, I think about it all the time. Right. We see the instability and class sizes and staffing at schools all over the district when we're two or three kids shy from two classes at a grade or three Classes versus So I'm just curious, kind of on that level, how do you re engage folks?

D: I talk about it a little bit. I think that's the piece, right? We talk about the communication, right. We have to let folks know what we offer. We have a robust offerings through our pps, you know, that I don't think any other district, whether it's private or public, can offer. And so I think we have to communicate that out there. We have to make sure that folks know what we have, how we're doing and where we're going. Right. Of course. We have to be as transparent as we can be to let them know, well, what's the real information? Now there's a lot of misinformation that gets out there and then once they realize the real information, they're like, oh, okay. But I think it's that kind of communication, communication and engagement to show folks that we have a lot to offer here. You know, we have folks that have that when they graduate, they go off to do great things. Right. And so I think we have to try to focus on that aspect of it and get away from the noise and the distractions that comes. You know, with a district this size. You know, when we talk about class sizes, our class sizes has kind of been steady, you know, as far as I from not only be here three years, but for the last three years they've been steady about one or two kids here and there. But overall it's been steady.

You know, those are some of the things that I think we need to focus on to start bringing and getting that recapture rate for folks to come back to pps.

B: Thank you. I'd like to add to that, but we also have to be really honest that there are some big classes and what are we going to do? What are we going to try to do about it? And a lot of that is getting more funding. So we can't pretend it's not there. There are problems. And so that's another thing we really have to be honest. Thank you. I get to ask one of the really fun questions here. Has the district done much planning around the outcome if the local option levy is not approved by the voters? And what would that look like and.

C: Thank you for that question, Commissioner. The current levy tax expires in June 2025. If the levy does not pass this election, the board could still choose to put the measure on the November 2024 election on the ballot. However, if the levy measure does not pass in that case or before it's set to expire, the teaching and support positions will not be funded as proposed and the current property tax of $1.99 per 1,000 of assessed property value will not continue. Without the levy funds, our district would be faced with $100 million budget gap for the 2025-2026 school year and we would be looking at a significant reduction in teaching staff. As we will discuss later on in this conversation, we're continuing to advocate for additional resources at the state and federal level, but we are not aware of any other funding streams at this moment that could material replace those local option levy funds.

start time: 508:10:10.000
end time: 514:15:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: It's obviously good that you're doing this in a year in advance of when you need the funding. And just a reminder that 100 million is from the school levy, there would be an additional reduction just based on the general fund expenditures and revenues not aligning. This budget problem that we're in right now is a three year problem, not a one year problem.

A: We've talked about community confidence and then there's the broader issues around tax burden in Multnomah county and in Oregon, certainly in the Portland area and in Oregon in general. What's your confidence, what's your confidence that this passes and that voters are supportive of the measure?

start time: 521:48:00.000
end time: 528:51:40.000
confidence: 0.94
D: I think it's going to. I'm very confident it's going to pass. Anytime you have something that directly affects your kid, you're most likely going to vote for that. Right? You know, so I'm very confident it's going to pass. I think people, I think people understand the, the effects of this doesn't pass and would it have on their kids. And so I think people will pass because it directly affects their kids.

start time: 528:58:40.000

B: We also know because it's a renewal that it greatly increases the likelihood. So there's distinction we found among voters the last two years between things that are renewals and those that are new, new taxes or would be an increase. So part of our communication is we're making sure that people know that it's renewal, but the rate stays the same. It's also important across the region because there's been this regional discussion about increases and trying to just keep it at renewal. So I think it's another reason, in addition to what Chair Holland said, why you feel uncomfortable but not overconfident. And I know you can't engage in this as a district directly, but do you have, working with your community support group, some who can be more actively educating people about this measure? Have they done any kind of polling or anything like that? Have you seen anything that would. So actually the district is involved. Oh, share that. So we did some polling and we did see that people were tax sensitive and so the affordability issue. And also we know that this community values the comprehensive set of electives, the technical declaration, career technical education. Our students get art, music, PE and reasonable class sizes. And those are all very compelling arguments for people to support it. So just given the ongoing conversations around the fundings with school, the challenges with school funding, we know that conversations are also ongoing with the legislature. And so what are some plans or a strategy to address that? And are there specific changes that you'd like to see at the policy level now?

start time: 563:58:50.000

C: Thank you for that question. We're at the beginning stages of developing our legislative agenda that the board will approve prior to the 2025 legislative session. We've already called the district has already called on the governor and legislature to review and change the state school funding formula as we head into this session. We're also urging the state and will continue urging them to modernize and fully fund the quality education model, which is a statistical analysis that the state conducts on what it would cost to provide a quality education to all of Oregon's 197 districts. We're asking for an adjustment so that the funding to Oregon's urban schools can be addressed as we have higher costs and needs. We're calling on the state to remove the cap on special education funding that does not align with the number of special education students that districts serve. And we'll also be calling on them to remove the statutory limit on local option levy collections as if the funding changes and we're projected to reach to bring in higher local option levy revenue. There is a statutory cap on what we can collect and if we exceed that, that will be deducted from our state's school fund revenue. So we want to make sure that cap is addressed. We'll continue working with several K12 organizations, families and community members to elevate these priorities to the governor's office and legislature.

start time: 589:16:30.000

B: Do you have a proposed timeline from like the time that you're going to introduce these to the legislature to when you might see actual changes or what can be Implemented?

start time: 592:07:10.000
end time: 614:22:40.000
confidence: 0.97
C: That's a great question. We're going to continue calling on the state to, you know, at a minimum provide funding to meet school districts needed service levels. It's not just our district that is facing these really difficult financial constraints. It's a statewide issue. We've seen a lot of headlines from districts all over. So we really need the legislature to ensure that they can meet these acute financial challenges or it will be become very dire statewide. But we don't want to just put be constrained by, you know, the needed service level. We still want the state to really look at fully funding the quality education model. I think that will be important for, for the state to take on. And as a part of the modernizing the qem, the state should really accurately capture the current realities of our schools by evaluating current expenses and incorporating new costs like current best teaching practices and technology, expanded access to early learning and more support for student behavioral health. So we want to think, you know, we want to make sure that we can support schools districts through this really difficult time, but that we're also thinking more holistically and, and doing what the state can to provide a quality education to students.

C: Based on our current projections, which are lower than what we had initially projected, we're not expecting to hit that statutory cap. But if this, you know, if anything changed or if assessed real estate values went up or, you know, things that we haven't predicted changed, we could still reach that cap. I think it's very unlikely that it will happen in the lifecycle of the levy, but it's something we want to plan for in the future.

A: How are you engaging with community members? The conversation around state funding has been kind of on the radar for a long time, but certainly elevated in the wake of upcoming budget cuts with a teacher strike. And not just in Portland. Right. That's something we're seeing especially in all the urban districts over Oregon. There's a. Franklin High School has a town hall on Monday with state legislators. I think a lot of, a lot of community members don't necessarily know what, what to ask for except for more money. Right. Like they'll fund the qem. I think has been a refrain, but there's more to it than that. And I'm curious how you're engaging with community members to help support these efforts. Right. Because the school district going to legislators necessarily have the same impact as the swath of our community.

start time: 639:15:22.000
end time: 672:57:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: There are a couple of other coalitions that are being built around other agencies that have grassroots approaches with parent groups across the state. I could mention Stanford Children. I'm sure there are many others. The superintendents are forming a similar coalition to what we did back in 2011 when there was a pretty successful initiative around policy change at the state level. And while it is more more on the news in the larger urban areas, I would say our smaller districts are really suffering as well. And so we want to make sure that we have good, thoughtful representation in this coalition and common messaging about where we want to go. I think what's going to be hard and Lisa and somebody else was telling me this recently, we almost have to do a whole new education of how many legislators have been elected new. And so a lot of the terms that we talk about when it comes to education funding, we may have to do more stair stepping in terms of background work with them. In addition to some of the passion we typically bring to the table when we're advocating. The other thing I would say is, for example, the Portland association of Teachers is very engaged with the finance groups. So this is going to be a place where, especially after last fall, where we had some divisions in the school community, where we're all going to be able to come together and advocate together for our kids. And I think that's my experience, because that's how I started 25 years ago is that's a very powerful coalition to show up in Salem, but also at people's town halls in their neighborhoods, you know, when they're running into them at the bank or the grocery store. So I feel just talking to especially young parents who are just entering the system, a real new energy and desire to make a difference in Salem in those conversations and doing it again with teachers and superintendents and the rest of the school community.
