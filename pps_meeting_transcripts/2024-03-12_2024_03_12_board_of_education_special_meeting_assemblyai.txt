B: I would, Vice Chair Green. And thank you to you and the board for understanding that I needed to be off site this evening. I wish I was there with you. Last week we shared with you some options for making up the loss of instructional time following the challenge that we faced this year due to severe weather and following the teacher strike. We appreciated the conversation and listened closely to the discussion that we had. And we come back with a resolution that we hope recaptures that we believe recaptures much of the lost instructional time for our elementary students and also recover some of the time for seniors while still not impacting regularly scheduled graduations. I'm going to stop here and ask Margaret Calvert. Margaret Calvert, to come forward and walk you through what we hope that you will be voting on tonight. And thank you, Margaret.

C: Good evening. Board of Directors, Student Representative Silverstein and Superintendent Husk, thank you for convening a meeting so quickly to address the issues that were surfaced. There's some timelines that are going to be helpful for us to consider as we go through. My name is Margaret Calvert and I'm the Assistant Superintendent for Multiple Pathways to Graduation and Secondary Schools. And again, I want to thank you for the time and the discussion that we had last week. And as we go through, to think of the time, you know, again, we appreciate the timeliness of getting the information, thinking it through, and getting it out to our students, staff and families as quickly as possible. I think I have. Let's see.

C: So, as you are aware, we've had a number of disruptions this year. And so far, prior to the severe weather in January, we made a number of additions and changes to the calendar and the school year and how we were operating in order to address instructional time and to provide as much opportunity as possible for students to engage in school and develop academic momentum that we can sustain hopefully, through the remainder of the school year. So as part of that plan, we added 11 instructional days to the calendar by changing, we added five days at winter break. We changed one of the planning a professional learning day to instructional day. We changed also one of our learning days that professional learning days in February to an instructional day. We've done it again in April 8th and then we've added three days at the end of the school year. So there's 11 days that have already been added to the school year are repurposed to provide additional instructional time. We also, during the process of coming on re entry from the strike, we added in four nights of evening conferences to make up for the time that we did not have conferences around fall break. We also in the second semester reduced the number of flex days from 22 to 16. And then we added a full day for seniors on May 30. So that was prior to any weather that happened in January. So in January, as you know, we had some impacts and that, you know, we ended up with a three hour early dismissal on a Friday and then the following week we ended up without holding classes at all during that following week. So when we look at this, this table, this summarizes the number of hours we had planned to recover from coming out of the strike. That is the second column with the January weather that shows the loss of instructional time that we had at the various grade levels. The days are slightly different length for students at various grade levels. Then you see the overall impact, the highlighted aqua blue numbers, kind of like the chill of winter show where we fell below the required instructional time. So kindergartners have a required instructional time of 900 hours. Seniors have 966. All the other grade levels, we are on the very close for elementary, we're within an hour and a half right now. But all the other grade levels, with the changes we had made coming back in, you know, we're, we're at, you know, above the minimum. Again, what I would say is that our goal is to have is not to be at the minimum, right. And to provide as much instruction as we can throughout the school year. So I think after our conversation last week, I think it was last week, it just was a week ago. We came back and said, okay, what can we do to make some additional adjustments that would provide additional especially for our kindergartners and elementary students and our seniors who are most impacted relative to the minimum number of instructional hours. So we have come back and said that we'll convert 15 minutes recess to instruction for 20 days in April. That would recover five hours at the elementary level as we mentioned and was in the board memo that we would add a full day on March, mostly on March 20th for seniors. Some schools did SAT already and they added the two hours already on the testing day to recover two hours. And then we've added one more day for seniors on May 31st. So they're we've actually extended the school year for seniors to the Friday before graduations begin on Sunday. So that's an additional seven and a half hours for the seniors as well. When we do that, we can look at again we looked at the impact and then we just added a column and said with these adds, how close are we getting to the instructional time? And again we are meeting the middle and elementary instructional time and that for 9th through 11th graders there are two different high school schedules. One is a rotating AB block and one is a fixed schedule. So that's why there's slightly two different numbers up here. We find that even with those, we do not meet the minimum number of hours required from Division 22. So what we are asking and in the resolution before you is that we, the state superintendent has said that we can apply and reach out for emergency up to 14 emergency hours. When we do that, we get almost everyone above the thresholds that we're talking about with the exception of McDaniel and Jefferson, which are the two seniors that have fixed schedules. Jefferson, as a reminder, also had a water main break and a fire in the neighborhood that had us dismissing early on another day. So they have a slightly different number of hours that are needed to recover. So we're requesting the second part of the resolution is around looking at the exemption that is possible to use professional professional learning time as instructional time. And with those adjustments then all grade levels would meet the minimum number of hours that are required. Again, the goal that we are all saying is that we are not interested in being at minimums like that is not where we want to be as a district. And we are also recognizing this has been an exceptional year and thinking about how to support our kindergarteners as well as our seniors in particular. In addition to what we've described, this is what we'll see in front of you is this again, we're planning to provide a K5 Summer Acceleration Academy to support students as we go through. The dates are listed and they'll probably be at 8 to 11 sites across the district. The website is linked so that you can see sort of what the information looks like and that's all dependent on funding. So this is a draft, but the plan is to try to bring this forward at this point. So finally, the resolution before you has has three different parts. One is that is to acknowledge the efforts that we have talked about to increase instructional time through the use of. Excuse me, of recess and to look at the emergency opportunity. What we have to do in order to receive the to be able to count the instructional hours is that we have to right to seek permission from ODE and we have to complete that by May 1st. In addition, we need to note and acknowledge that we're going to count the instructional PD time, excuse me, the professional learning time as instructional hours. And that is explicitly to support seniors. And we need to in this resolution. It does both to allow us to meet the needs, particularly for our seniors. And I think that families are very anxious to know like are we changing graduation? So those are the two big pieces today in front of you and I think that's the overview of what is before you and I'm happy to take questions as needed.

A: All right, well, before we do that, can I get a motion and a second to adopt Resolution 6861 resolution to address unanticipated lost instructional time and use of ODE permission and exemptions for the 2324 school year.

A: We got a motion first. All right. Excellent. It was motioned by director Eddie Wong Moves and director Patty Sullivan seconds. Now, is there any board discussion?

F: It's more a statement than a discussion, but I'd like to quote from an email that the board has received from a graduating senior's parent. If you are not aware, this particular class of seniors had to start off their high school careers laying in their beds doing online School. In 2020, they were robbed of the initial excitement that naturally comes from starting high school. They are just now getting on their feet after that devastating blow to their social and mental development. And they deserve the grand graduation celebrating their achievements publicly. If you take that away from them by extending the school year for a few days, you will be breaking many hearts in this city. In my opinion, it is too late in the year to be pulling any changes to the schedule anymore. The snowstorm was unfortunate. So was the extended closure for the strike and prolonged painful negotiations. But a few more days in June will not fix any of that. Please, for all that is good in the world, let the class of 2024 have the graduations they deserve and have been promised up to this point. The canceling of Providence park graduations would be a grave disservice to a large group of Kids. Soul crushing. In fact, I have worked hard to keep my senior engaged and involved. But I can personally see the devastating effect on her when the institution she's part of continues to let her down and show her that she's not important. So that's from a parent of a senior. And then I have something I'd like to add for myself. I would like to clarify a statement that I made last week alluding to taking away 15 minutes of recess from primary students. Since only kindergarten students were required to add 15 minutes to the day, I stated that I did not see the need to take 15 minutes of recess away from all of the primary students. When I said that the kindergarten students wouldn't notice, I meant that their teachers would be able to make changes in the curriculum where they would not notice the lack of physical activity. There is no one more creative than a kindergarten teacher. They will be able to turn math and language arts lessons into active play. There is no need to tell the children that they are missing any recession. I also think that the rest of the primary team would reach out to those kindergarten teachers and make sure that if they were missing some break time that they would help them out with that. There is no perfect solution, but I feel that accepting the 14 hours also being creative with kindergarten learning and keeping graduation where it is is the best one that we have. Thank you.

G: I have a question I just want to clarify. On the slide that has total instructional hours, 20, 23, 24 that McDaniel and Jefferson are getting, plus two. I don't understand the exemption from the PD.

start time: 247:10:50.000
end time: 258:37:12.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yes. So Division 22 has a number of things that we can, as a school district can count as instructional time. We typically do not count the hours that are professional learning. And in order to make this, we would ask that two hours be counted for McDaniel for instructional time and nine for Jefferson. So there are a number of things that we can. That we can count. So parent conferences or family conferences, academic conferences is one. There are some pieces around. Professional learning is another. There's a variety of them. So we're asking specifically for professional learning to be. For these two schools to be counted.

start time: 258:39:36.000
end time: 262:11:04.000
confidence: 0.98
G: And that would make them on par with the other schools. I guess I was surprised when I read through the materials that because they're on the fixed schedule that they get overall less instructional time. At McDaniel and Jefferson, I was surprised.

start time: 262:13:12.000
end time: 274:59:22.000
confidence: 0.92
C: To learn that, yeah, it's slightly different, the rotating schedules. The benefit for both schools is that they want a fixed schedule that's predictable for the work they do with partners. So Lincoln and Cleveland, for example, they rotate abab so you don't know there's not in Franklin. Right. So in Benson that it's an A day may be a Monday or a Tuesday. Right. And so at Jefferson, for example, when you're working with the students at pcc, PCC schedule schedules are Monday or Wednesday or Tuesday or Thursday. So we created a fixed schedule in order for them to align with their partners. And McDaniel had enough work with partners that they felt that that was important for them to have a fixed schedule as well.

D: Two questions and then just some comments. I'm curious about the other schools that lost time like Force Part Markham and Gray. How are we addressing that lost instructional time?

start time: 280:04:58.000
end time: 285:04:02.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So we are assessing and developing plans for those schools as well. We are coming today for the sort of the district wide move and then also specifically for seniors. So we're working through what are the options and some of the pieces that we can do for Forest park and Markham in particular.

start time: 285:05:46.000
end time: 287:49:27.000
confidence: 0.89
D: So you'll be coming back. Yep. But would the 14 hours be applying to also Forest Park, Marcum and Robert Gray?

start time: 287:51:03.000
end time: 288:12:59.000
confidence: 0.77
C: Yes. Yes.

start time: 288:18:39.000
end time: 291:01:59.000
confidence: 0.95
D: And then just on the seniors piece, and I know I raised this at the meeting last week, but the seniors already have a different end of the school year date, right?

start time: 291:03:59.000
end time: 291:15:03.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Correct.

start time: 291:17:11.000
end time: 294:38:08.000
confidence: 0.96
D: So we could actually do something that addresses the rest of the system that still wouldn't impact the seniors. I mean they already end earlier, correct?

start time: 294:39:44.000
end time: 294:48:00.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Correct.

start time: 294:49:20.000
end time: 299:58:20.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Right. So we could have said that is just what it's going to be and done something different for seniors. So it's not by accepting the 14 hours for everybody else doesn't mean we don't have to move the senior's graduation. If we say they're a separate class which they're already treated separately because their graduation's early.

start time: 300:19:20.000
end time: 303:59:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I think Director Bim Edwards, if I can, I have a question for you and then I an idea. When you say we'll come back on those other three schools, you mean just for information. Correct.

start time: 304:07:20.000
end time: 307:51:40.000
confidence: 0.93
D: But I get it made it sound like you need to have some sort of approval because they're losing even more. They've lost even more hours than everybody else. I'm assuming we had to approve something, but is that not the case?

start time: 308:08:50.000
end time: 309:44:30.000
confidence: 1.00
B: I don't think you need to approve anything, but I think we should inform the whole board what it is we come up with for solutions.

start time: 309:54:10.000
end time: 321:57:52.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So we were we there are a couple times. There are a couple things I would say. One is we looked at the district wide impacts first and then there we're not through winter weather yet. And so part of what ends up happening is we come back for specific individual schools when we say this is what they need. So we will. That's our typical standard practice that we do with Division 22. We may come back and say, you know, for various reasons, whether it's a boiler or, you know, there are a couple of. There are a couple of issues with air quality at a couple schools, for example, from the community that when we do that, then we come back and address those specifically. And we do that as part of the Division 22 process, which wouldn't be until next year.

start time: 321:58:16.000
end time: 328:52:38.000
confidence: 0.94
D: And we don't. We don't vote on the Division 22 anymore. You'd just be reporting that. So in effect, for those schools, the board's not gonna vote on anything. Are you gonna work with the communities? We're getting a fair amount of emails from them about their interest in making up the lost instructional time that was beyond what everybody else lost.

start time: 328:54:54.000
end time: 341:23:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yes. So we're working with them to develop plans. Some of what we are looking at, and I think it's. We would do it in collaboration with the school communities and the principals. And ultimately what we do is we kind of, you know, we kind of keep a running tally of are there reasons that schools have had to, you know, not be in session for a particular reason? And then we'll resolve that at the end and say, are there any other. Any other issues that we're seeing? The 14 hours is helpful in that. But I think that ultimately the goal is to recover as much instructional time as possible. We want to be explicit as possible with the particular schools that have most impacted coming from the schoolroom.

start time: 341:29:10.000
end time: 400:31:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Great. So just some comments. That's okay. So just to the presentation, the conversation. The presentation said that 11 days were being added, and actually they weren't added. Their makeup days. We should be clear. So their makeup days and students were out of school all of November. I don't support the use of the waiver and the loss of 14 instructional hours because it's taking away instructional time for students. And we know from the data that our students were heavily impacted by Covid, the loss of learning, being out of school, and then also November having been out pretty much all month. So I don't support using the waiver. I would have supported making up days at the end of the school year, with the exception of the seniors. Again, I think we already treat them differently. We could have carve them out. And I also wanted just a cautionary note about using professional development so in the. I knew you were at high school principal at the time when there was a complaint filed against the district because high school students were being shortchanged instructional hours. And then there was two years of conversation with the state about what counts as instructional hours. And there are things that count as instructional hours that as I think a parent would not say are instructional hours. Because when teachers getting professional development, that's not actually instruction. It's a good thing to do, but it's not actually instructional time. Oregon already has one of the shortest years, the school years in the country. And so when we are moving the hours around so that we meet the bare minimum, it's not what our students need in order to catch up from COVID or just be on pace to be able to perform at class level. So. And also for that, and also, you know, I know kindergarten teachers are super resourceful. I also was a kindergartner, I remember back then, but also like I had a child who needed time to. It was torture being in the class and needed time to get outside and just move around. So it seems just like not a great way for us to sort of make up time. And my preference would be we add the days at the end of school year. I think that's the right thing, would have been the right thing to do for our students. And yes, it would have costed money. But you're only in second grade once or in fourth grade once or in sixth grade once. So my preference is we in the future try and avoid, like build our calendar that we build in more weather days that we build in other days that we can build back so that we're not stuck at the end of the year with. Because we know, we know things happen. We know our things happen with our buildings that we don't get in the position where we just have to take the waiver that's given us and our students end up with less instructional time.

start time: 401:48:50.000
end time: 404:37:20.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Yeah, I just. I had thought that if we did not take those 14 hours, the seniors would have to graduate later. Is that true or not?

start time: 405:10:20.000
end time: 410:29:08.000
confidence: 0.96
C: If we don't take the hours, we're gonna have to do something else to address it to meet the standard. That is true. So it would be that. It could be that we would move graduations. That's right. Or it could be that we, you know, it's as we talked about, like, are we using other days in a different way? For example, like you could have though.

start time: 410:30:04.000
end time: 411:21:20.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Accepted the hours for the seniors, but not everyone else. Right.

start time: 411:38:00.000
end time: 415:11:00.000
confidence: 0.96
C: The language is vague in that. And it is a statement of we're not going to. We will use it to meet the hours as needed, but we're not going to use like, we're going to try to recover as many hours as we can, if that makes sense.

start time: 415:16:40.000
end time: 416:40:20.000
confidence: 0.97
D: But the state didn't say you have to apply it differently for different. The same for all the grades.

confidence: 0.94
B: Director Brim Edwards, this is Superintendent Husk. I'm sorry, I'm off site. It's a little awkward, and I can see Andrew's raised his hand. When we do the waiver, if we do submit the waiver, I think we should specifically say which grade levels we are requesting it for and let them know that the other grades have met the standard. I hear your point.

E: Thank you. And I apologize I can't be there tonight in person as well. I actually. I have a couple of things to say, but first, I want to just ask Director Ben Matters, do you have an amendment that you want to bring forward tonight around this resolution?

start time: 429:08:30.000
end time: 434:16:50.000
confidence: 0.94
D: No, because last meeting, Director Green said there were four votes to pass it, and the decision was made just to move ahead. So, no, I'm not bringing an amendment because the decision was made to bring this resolution forward. And there were votes. The votes were forward. That's understandable.

start time: 434:51:40.000
end time: 448:20:40.000
confidence: 0.96
A: It's a voting system. You only need four votes to pass anything within the PPS school district. That's the way that our system is set up. When we go to make the. When we go to do a vote, if four votes say yes, four hands say yes, then it moves forward. If that's not the case, then it goes back and something else happens. At this point, we need to get it on the table so that we've got it on the table for a vote. I feel like everybody needs to have their discussion, say whatever their heart so desires about, you know, about where they're at. But at the end of the day, we have to vote and we have to make a decision one way or another. Poop or get off the pot. That's what we got to do. So this is the pot, and we got to figure out what we're going to do with it. So that's where I'm at, Director Scott.

end time: 456:46:04.000
confidence: 0.94
E: I'm ready to. Okay, no, thanks. And I have a couple more. I guess I was just. Yeah, I was curious because it just from the statement, it felt like, you know, I mean, whether we want to explore other options, like adding extra days, which of course, you know, has a significant cost to the district, would require additional cuts. I just wasn't sure. My specific question does, does the. The recess 15 minutes apply just to the kindergartners who are short? It does apply to all K5 students. That's a question for staff.

start time: 456:47:32.000
end time: 461:10:00.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I'd like to take that question. Director Scott at this point, we're going to be working with the elementary principals in making sure that it goes with kindergarten only. And I also wanted to say we should have put it in the PowerPoint. It was my mistake. It's only the month of April.

start time: 461:45:40.000
end time: 478:47:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Okay, that's helpful. I think what I would say, and I expressed some of these concerns last time. I'm concerned about the removal of even 15 minutes of recess time for elementary students. And I think my question, and it is somewhat, you know, it kind of gets to the academic theory, you know, and whether that, whether that's valuable, the additional time versus the recess time, which we also know is really important for students. And I think my overall question, and I would pose this to the board because I'm happy to bring an amendment, you know, if needed, is if we only need to do the 15 minutes for kindergartners and not for the rest, and logistically that proves to be very difficult. Or actually, I would take it even a step further. If kindergartners are the only ones missing it, and they are the ones where recess is most important. It's important for all K through 5. But my mom was a preschool and kindergartener teacher and play is actually so essential to their overall learning. I actually would be in favor of us just.
