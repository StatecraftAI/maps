A: Good evening everyone. I will officially call to order the annual Portland Public Budget hearing. My name is Harmony Quitos. I'm the chair of the Tax Supervising and Conservation Commission. I welcome everyone Today's hearing. Nice to see everyone again after the levy hearing a few a month ago. Yeah, congratulations on the levy. We can start there. As a reminder, the TSCC is a community oversight commission established by the Oregon Legislation legislature more than 100 years ago. The commission oversees the budgets of all TSCC member taxing districts and annually conducts a thorough budget review and certification process. Additionally, the TSCC holds public budget hearings to engage with district leadership and provide additional opportunity for public comment before the budget is adopted. I'll now ask my fellow commissioners and the staff to introduce themselves and state if they have any business relationships with the district that could be perceived as a common conflict of interest. Hi everybody.

A: We appreciate the deep bench that PPS always hearing. Will. We'd like to start by acknowledging the district's receipt of the meritorious budget award from the association of School Business Officials international for the 2324 budget book. We like to highlight great, transparent, clear budget books. They're not only useful for us in our process and our analysis, but also just such a resource for the public in understanding where they're where and how their tax dollars are being spent. So start with that. I'll give an opportunity for the district to provide some introductory remarks, after which we'll hear public comment and then we'll ask questions and discuss the budget with you. Chair Hollins, you have anything you'd like to start with?

start time: 104:15:30.000
end time: 117:59:30.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I think, you know, just beginning that, you know, this budget cycle was of course challenging for everyone. You know, no one wants to make cuts to that affect our kids. And I think, you know, with the amazing staff that we've had kept a lot of those cuts away from the kids. And I think, you know, that's that was our priority. And and so just, you know, thanking our staff, our interim superintendent who came in with a fresh set of eyes experience to prioritize certain things. I think it made for cuts even though we didn't want to, but again just made sure that they were farther away from our kids so our kids can have the educational experience that they deserve.

C: Just to say that I got here on February 12, I did some onboarding in January and Guadalupe and team had done a lot of the core work and following the values that Gary has outlined of trying to reduce staffing and reduce costs as needed to try to protect programs. A few general comments. I think it was great that a lot of the instructional structures that are showing that the dial on academic achievement is moving, graduation rates are in a good place that those things have stayed in. I am very worried for the district going forward knowing that there's a significant year of cuts coming up. So I did inherit that and then we, we made a few adjustments as we moved forward. The board has made an adjustment in a recent motion that they made. Basically Guadalupe and his team did a lot of the heavy lifting. The other thing I would say that typical budget process, even though in the public it only looks like it's a few months behind the scenes, it's a 12 month cycle. So the adjustment that had to be made after the strike because we had a month lost. It was a very tight timeline for staff to come in and say, okay, how do we move this budget forward for the 2425 school year? So huge kudos to the budget team and all the folks that had input into that. We did receive your questions. We have prepared some answers. We can talk through those or we can go more randomly, but you will have a printed copy of those.

C: Making some really challenging decisions about where to cut. Could you share some about your process and how you chose what to prioritize for for those HUDs?

start time: 163:12:04.000
end time: 215:27:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah. You know, our district is indeed experiencing challenging financial constraints. And because our revenues are not keeping pace with the cost of operating the school system, there will be reductions in the coming year throughout the organization. We must balance the budget and continue to meet student needs. You know, and that's the balancing act that we try to try to try to do. The reductions will impact all PPS communities in some way, shape or form, which is something that we are trying to minimize. Student experience has always been a priority in our budget process and change is going to be very small this year due to the prioritization that we, that we use. We center priorities when making decisions, especially when, you know, looking at the shortfalls that require large reductions. We prioritize what we call the big three bets which is high quality grade level and standard aligned curriculum materials and handle very teacher. And so those are the prioritization three things that we look at when doing productions. We had a unified vision of what teaching and learning should look like in every classroom every day which we call our instructional framework. Also finally, just in time, our job embedded professional learning to strengthen instructional practices and build expand teeter capacity. These investments represent our most promising levers to improve student outcomes and advance our district and board goals for student achievement. One of the early phases of the budget making decisions was designed a core requirement for schools to align with district priorities. Phases that ensure schools are staffed to meet core programs requirements and contractual requirements. This year, PPS staff analyzed the overall system of school based supports including central and school based program positions. The goal this year was to be more strategic and provide specifics about allocations to schools that need additional support and identify and streamline areas of redundancy. One of the things that they looked at as far as the area of redundancy, you know, is the pre kindergarten and early learning and Head Start program offerings. The budget consolidates these, some of these services and spent a lot of months analyzing the programs to determine opportunities with streamlined resources while maintaining the same number of pre K Head Start classrooms and the same high quality programming for students and family. So they looked at braiding all of the funding sources and collapsing unnecessary sources or things that or duplicates as well. So those are some of the things. Hopefully. I answer your question.

A: I had a question about that example. We met with the county early last week, two weeks ago and talked a lot about preschool for all. And that effort, is there work being done to you incorporate the Head Start, the pre K programs here within that umbrella as an alternate funding source or is there an effort to maintain our own PPS's own act? Anybody?

A: Just curious how all of these districts intersect. Right. Go ahead, Matt. I think you're continuing on this line of conversation. Yeah.

start time: 232:15:24.000
end time: 241:58:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: As as you mentioned and you know, not only PPS is dealing with kind of the double whammy of federal Covid funds going away and enrollments dropping. You know that results in cuts and as you said, there's going to be more cuts next year. So could you please talk about how the district plans to handle that and putting the district on a stabilized budget for short term and the long term.

start time: 242:05:50.000
end time: 242:49:58.000
confidence: 0.90
C: So I'll take that one. I would say it's a triple whammy.

start time: 242:51:34.000
end time: 243:32:38.000
confidence: 0.78
B: Okay. Left out of whammy. Yeah.

start time: 243:32:54.000
end time: 276:25:20.000
confidence: 0.96
C: You left out it's enrollment decline. The Esther funds we are feeling. But I think this district made good decisions about knowing that those funds were going to go away and using them for one time purposes. But I, I think the third part of the stool and having been a Superintendent back in 2006-2014, I can say that there is pretty distinct in disconnect between what the state funds and what the community wants in education. I believe that the current service level needs a serious deep dive to see if it even comes close to aligning to the quality QAM education model. Thank you. Qam. There's lots of conversations with the superintendent groups that I'm participating in or I have been up to this point as to how do we participate on the governor's committees, how do we make sure that they understand that while the Student Success Acts was a really good infusion of finance for school districts, those are designated funds and what we're struggling with are the core functions, what it takes to run organizations of this size Especially with communities, which we're proud of, that demand high quality instruction, robust curriculum, lots of program supports, etc. So we can adjust on enrollment declines. It's not pleasant, right? You can adjust on the asset funds. But this overall I would call an inadequacy of the state funding formula in the state of Oregon needs some serious political lift. And I know we've got a lot of parents in this community, a lot of elected officials in the community, a lot of business leaders that will step up to that challenge. We're trying to get that stage set now through acosa, the administrators association. So when the biennium opens, we've raised the level of their understanding in the governor's office and at the legislative level.

start time: 276:41:00.000
end time: 277:30:40.000
confidence: 0.83
B: So I've got a follow up on that.

start time: 278:06:20.000
end time: 284:16:12.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Just going to add to that. First of all, passing the local option was a huge stabilizer. It's $100 million a year. So just having that in place creates a strong foundation in addition on the enrollment. So having been around PBS for a long time, I've seen enrollment go up and down and some pretty big downs in the past. And one of the things that I.

start time: 284:16:36.000
end time: 284:47:24.000
confidence: 0.86
B: Think will benefit us is like, I.

start time: 284:47:32.000
end time: 306:44:10.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Think part of the reason they went down is obviously Covid and in virtual learning. But then on top of that, kids being out of school most of last November, that we had a strong end of the school year. And I'm really confident that we're going to have a strong start to the next school year. And so rebuilding confidence in public schools for parents in this community. And also to communicate about the value proposition of Portland Public Schools, we have some, you're all parents or any of your parents, so you understand the very unique things that Portland Public Schools can offer students. I think we need to continue to communicate that to families because public schools are a great value proposition. And then the last thing I would say at the state level, in addition to the state school fund, there's other levers that PBS could potentially influence that could impact the amount of funds coming. For example, the formula, we don't have a cost of doing business. Obviously, it's much more expensive to do business in the metro area than it is in other places in the state and not really a factor for that in the formula. So there's some other places also, in addition to the items that Superintendent Hussemit mentioned, that we potentially could leverage more funds from ups.

start time: 307:17:50.000
end time: 319:14:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So the interim superintendent and Director Edwards, you both have mentioned the formula. When I was at Portland State and Portland State was a member of the Oregon University system. There was a formula and everybody was trying to adjust the formula so that we could get more money into the universities. Is there a task force in this association perhaps that's working on tweaking the formula or resetting the formula or working on reevaluating the formula? It sounds like there may be structural issues as well as financial issues.

start time: 319:36:20.000
end time: 330:48:16.000
confidence: 0.97
C: The governor pretty much called the task forces together. HOSA has a seat at the table. The systems that are about the size of Medford and above have been having weekly conversations about what we need to do to raise the understanding. I don't. I'm not a finance expert, but I'm guessing it's not going to be just a formula tweak. I think it really needs to be a strong recognition that we can't keep up with the infrastructures if we want to have a robust K12 education system in the state of Oregon. So we're preparing to lean in without necessarily coming in with our own formulas.

start time: 330:50:08.000
end time: 331:22:20.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Okay. Okay. Thank you.

start time: 331:30:00.000
end time: 353:00:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So we've heard a lot about the state side of things, and I think there's different levels of optimism or pessimism around, like, how effective those. Those changes might be. Is there work the district is doing internally structural to rethink some of our structures or approaches to the way we do business? You mentioned we're expecting more cuts next year. I think there's been just instability for a number of years. Right. For a number of factors. So while the state is certainly one lever to pull how that can go anyway. Right. Lots of politics to play at that level. And I think lots of people getting engaged now, especially after the strikes and the conversations and cuts all around the state. But are there, I guess, also asking, like at the district level, what are we doing to rethink some of the way we do business, to try and stabilize in the long term, short term and long term should. Maybe we don't get those formula changes or policy shifts at the state level.

start time: 353:42:40.000
end time: 403:35:26.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I'm just going to speak because I'm almost like an observer at this point. I'm sure there are some places to increase efficiency, but I'm also pretty comfortable saying that based on what this community expects the school district to offer and support, it will be impossible to make those adjustments at the district level through efficiencies. And so I think this board and this new wonderful leader will make decisions. I think the public engagement with our own employees around understanding what's going on with budgets, I think public engagements with our community about understanding what's going on, what is creating These things that appear to be unstable from the outside really need to be simplified and communicated often. And that's why I always mention the tight timeline. When you're working from, you know, about getting of 24 to putting this budget in front of everybody and getting closure, that's not enough of a timeline. You need a full 12 month cycle. And the example I would give back in 2008 when the recession hit 2009, Oregon started seeing the huge cliff that was coming on revenues in the state. In 2010, a lot of districts made really drastic cuts. At least we did in Salem. We closed schools, we laid off employees. It was huge. I talked about it all of 2009 because everybody needed to understand what we were going through and that we could get through it, but we could get through it only for a certain number of years. And then we had to sustain and say how are we going to build this back up? I don't think efficiencies will be enough internally. That's my opinion. I don't know. The other thing I would just add to that is with 80 to 85% of our cost in personnel and most of those in represented employees that we have contractual obligation that we've negotiated and negotiated what I think is a fair wage package for both the cost of living here in the metro area, but also for the work they do. So there's limited ability to change most of that. And as Director Hollins or Chair Holland said, really with the focus of trying to keep our focus on school based staff and school school supports is that's a large portion of our cost. So it leaves a much smaller discretionary budget that you could actually influence and bring efficiencies out of to Dr. So I mean I think that work will continue. It's just that piece of the pie.

start time: 403:35:58.000
end time: 408:33:40.000
confidence: 0.88
B: Isn'T big enough any other. When you talk about the expectations of, you know, parental community and the community at large is the largest driver of that. Is that can you identify, is it class sizes, is it program offerings?

start time: 408:44:40.000
end time: 417:06:30.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I would all of the above. And I think they go together. And my observation over the many years of doing this work is when you offer the number of robust programs that we have, career tech offerings, the dual language immersion offerings, you know, all of the arts and the special things that we have in the schools, it's a lot and the community loves it and they speak up loudly when they think that it's being, you know, that base is being shaken. But it requires a lot of staffing to do that.

start time: 418:34:10.000

confidence: 0.94
B: I almost have to apologize for this next question, I feel like I'm putting a little more salt in the wound. You get my passing. You prepared an answer already. And I'm sort of geek on the board here as part of the budget stuff, so I have to get asked a geeky question. So your approved budget includes an appropriation, about $1.8 million from your contingency to be spent on instruction specifically for racial equity and social justice contracts. How does this change impact your projected reserve levels and is it still within the policy? The level of 10%, I believe, is your policy goal for users. Are you moving towards that objective? Are you moving away from it by appropriating additional resources from your contingency and your reserves? Thank you, Commissioner. So I'll take that one. So the board's policy on reserves sets a goal of general fund reserves being between 5 to 10% of general fund revenues, annual general fund revenues. And that basically is just about, not, not quite accomplished in the budget that you're considering and discussing. We're discussing tonight. If the existing reserve, that is the beginning fund balance coming into this coming year, this coming fiscal year were to be included among total resources, then the budget would fall slightly short of 5%, that 5% minimum threshold. So that said, we staff will continue to update our financial projections, revenues, expenditures, fund balance projections, including closing the books for the year that we're wrapping up, 23, 24, and we will update our beginning fund balance accordingly. So in that whole process, we'll be updating the projections for the following year, 25, 26 year, which really represents the second year of a multi year effort to bring our ongoing expenditures into balance with our ongoing revenues. So in looking ahead to the following cycle, as Dr. Husk said, really we're getting started now to kind of get the fact base organized and, and the timeline and the milestones organized for the following year, 25, 26, we'll be updating the projections for the reserves that would otherwise happen if we didn't make some additional expenditure reductions. So that's kind of what's going on over the next several months with respect to that 10% goal that is spelled out in that board policy. I'll say, and I'll defer to directors and Dr. Armstrong as well as Dr. Husk on this. But as staff, we've mostly been organizing our recommendations around maintaining that 5% reserve, the sort of lower end of the range that's in board policy for the near term. And to the extent some of these structural shifts and improvements can be accomplished, especially with the state Budget that would allow the district, the board staff, the community to think more seriously I would say about Moving towards that 10%, the upper end of that range for the policy. But right so far the last year or so we haven't really been focusing on that 10% as much as the 5%.

A: So as a member of the CBRC 2014-12 to 2018 helped draft that adopted reserves policy and it was in the wake of the lead crisis and you know a hope that there wouldn't be that the district be well positioned face any unexpected challenges. Had we known the extent of the unexpected challenges that were to come with the pandemic we're seeing more and more extreme weather events, a long, a prolonged strike. I think I'd love to hear probably from board members about the beginning fund balance. The reserves is essentially one time money is a fixed pool that you can only dip into so often to.

So I'm curious if you could give us some insight into the decision to drop because short answer, no, you're not meeting your 5% policy so far in this budget cycle. Some of the intent around that and the decision making that has led to where you're at now and kind of the thinking around like what the efforts are moving forward just given some of the unprecedented and unexpected things that we continue to see year after year.

B: We were really looking at, looking at this how can we reduce the impact on immediately on kids and those that are going to need this support the most. You mentioned a lot of the faith, mentioned the, the COVID We mentioned the mental health issues that our, our kids that they're seeing right now. More more is more prevalent. We're coming into a time where kids are getting ready to be out of school and violence is outrageous and we're starting to see more and more shootings and we need more and more people that are going to be involved with kids on a daily basis giving them something to do somewhere long where they can be safe. And so when we started thinking about how can we use the funds that we have to minimize the impact that our students are going to be facing and we looked at the reserve and we said, you know it's raining right now and we can't use it all. Like, I mean, there's no way that we can use it all. They would come in, they would take schools from us, and there'd be nothing left. So we know that we can't use it all. So we began to think of, well, how can we use small portions of it to reduce some impact in some areas for those students that are most marginalized and need a lot more support, and how much are we actually talking about? And so at that point, it became a little easier to make a hard decision, one that you don't want to make and you wish you didn't have to. And at the end of the day, realizing that it was a decision that we needed to make in order to give our staff direction on where we wanted to see them go and how we wanted to see them move. So we made it. And we still come back to say that it's still not enough. We're gonna have to go back and we're gonna have to get people to come together. The only way we're gonna get to 10% and the reserves is you add more money to it to put there. The school districts are businesses. They don't make money. We don't have anything that we can sell that we can create an income from. And barring having something like that that can create and generate income, we're left with what you decide we're worth. And then you give us a little something, and then we have to figure out how to make that work, because that's all you're going to get. So be happy. And so we take what we've got and we figure out ways to make it work. And we rob Peter to pay Paul until somebody else gives us some more money so that we can pay Paul and Peter at the same time. But at the end of the day, there's just not enough there. And so you want us to get the 10%? Give me some more money and I'll get you there. To me, that's the supplement. So I have a camera that died here. I just need one minute to swap this with a different camera. Sure. Apologize. That would be a brief interruption. Thank you.

And we, we have a question about safety and security in the schools. Last year we had a rich conversation about this and you shared some work that you're doing and have been doing to improve safety and security in the schools, including the introduction of certified safety professionals, some new policies and procedures, training and some building and design efforts. And it looks like maybe there's some building going on right over here right now. We're going to be safer and more secure facilities or not, but there's a lot going on. Are you seeing results from this work and can you tell us how the number of safety and security incidents as a result compared this year to last year?

B: Hello everyone. Dan Young, Chief Operating Officer. Yeah, we're happy, we're happy to be able to increase our security personnel, our safety procedures last year in the written response. There's a good amount of data on the number of instances over the last two years, so I won't read all those unless you want me to. But in summary, the additional campus security personnel increased our ability to be proactive in identifying potential safety concerns, increased our daily safety and security assessments and also allow more effective and quick responses to those safety instances when they did occur. We added personnel across the district to make sure we had multiple staff at each of our high schools. We also elongated the time that they were at our high schools. We ensured every middle school had at least one dedicated safety associate and we increased capacity to support our elementary schools and our rovers that moved throughout the site and even cover our non school campuses to some degree. So with that we saw in some cases an increase in the total number of incidents. But we largely attribute that to our increased ability to respond to the incidents of like graffiti and vandalism, things like that. But in other cases, such as trespassing or theft, we saw those instances go down, which we attribute at least in part to having more campus security associated on the second to reduce those instances. So that's. Can I, would you Be comfortable in telling me. Student director Silverstein, how do you feel in school? Do you feel more safe? Do you feel less safe? What is your experience like?

A: I've got the next question. Harping back to all the conversations during the strike and the information or misinformation. What was in the news and what were heard from different stakeholders? We heard lots of discussions about the number of like administrative versus like central office versus school based staff and how PTS was different than some of the other districts. And I think we're asking maybe clear the air or clarify for the community like what that actually means is the comparison of central office versus school, school based support similar to other districts in our state or similar to other large urban districts, some of our, you know, our comparators and if, if not what, what, how do those differences play out and how has it changed over time?

start time: 705:57:40.000
end time: 708:20:50.000

C: So I worked in three states and five central offices. Three in the top seat, four if you count this one, which I do count.

confidence: 0.96
C: Thank you. Whole budget cycle and this is always a topic in every district that I've been associated with because it's easy to see the people in the schools that are needed. Because we're used to being in schools, it's harder to see the people in a central office that are needed because not all of us are used to running large organizations. But in terms of percentages, about 90% of the PPS staffing positions are focused on instruction, classroom and building support roles. And about 10% represent central office which include vital functions like payroll and HR and technology systems and facilities research. I could go on and on our class sizes. So that's pretty typical. It's pretty typical for this state. I can't say that we've done, I haven't done a national look on class sizes. We Compare very favorably. Our class sizes averages tend to be much lower than averages of other districts in the state. And I'm sure there's some exceptions on the ends.

start time: 728:15:30.000
end time: 740:45:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Just as a follow up to that. So we also know, and we've seen our staff works with budget staff, that there's been significant turnover in central office staffing, probably due to some of the instability in funding, the need for cuts and any other factors that difficult economic, a bigger economic picture as well. Can you give us some sense of some of those ideas, why this turnover is occurring and what the impacts are from these sorts of staff changes and what the district's doing to kind of mitigate those challenges, especially in some of the key functions that keep the district running.

start time: 740:51:30.000
end time: 770:38:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: We weren't really sure about the background of the question, so we answered it in two ways. In terms of the superintendent, I think it was really stable, like twice the national average. He was here almost seven full years. And I do see examples outside of the finance team where people are promoting up. They promote up, they come back, you know, to another promotion up. And you're going to get that, especially in a metro urban area where it's easy to drive from one district to another. You're just going to see that when you, when you hire well, they will promote up. In terms of the finance team, I would say that there has been quite a bit of turnover there. In general, it's really hard to find CFOs in school district business right now. Again, struggled with it in every place I've been and I do think that this particular budget has got a really heavy workload. The expectations, the exposure in the media, the exposure to the wonderful community review committees, that's not something you get in other size districts when you're the largest in the state. It carries a heavy factor and we've looked at some of our compensation and frankly, it may be that we have to look at that again if we want to get the stability that we need. I've been very worried, not about my own, not about this team here, but I've been very worried about the long run. When Myung's retired, he deserves to eventually say I'm done, and how we get a team in to shore up the wonderful workers that are here. And so HR has been working on that diligently and I'm sure with Dr. Armstrong's help, they'll dive back into that again.

start time: 772:50:30.000

B: So reports in the media about the effect of reductions on special education services in the district, part of the cuts in the budget. Could you provide us with a summary of how special education funding is changing in this budgets and how the students will be affected by those changes. So this year we are initiating our special education improvement plan which is rooted in our strategic plan. So this plan is organized to address our students level need, persistent gaps in achievement and more importantly is focused on what we've heard from our families and our students for increased need for engagement belonging in their schools. It's also informed by an external special education program review and direct input from our stakeholders, which includes our staff and our school leaders, in addition to families and students. Implementation of this plan, like I said, began this year. It was frequently referred to as a neighborhood schools plan. That's been in the media also and this year has been focused on two schools. In the future we'll be moving into six schools for next year and then in the future into all of your secondary schools. So program shifts that are foundational to this plan were initiated this year focusing on the fall. And these program shifts are required to support students in their neighborhood school. And these coincidentally happen at the same time. So these staffing adjustments happen at the same time due to our labor agreements that our budget processes happen. And so what is occurring is these philosophical shifts and actions require moving from an allocation of staffing from centralized support roles to staff being allocated to building support roles to support instruction of service delivery in our schools. And so what the budget includes is a combination of funding functions, general funds and grant funds that in total includes an actual increase in licensed special education staff of 7fte in comparison to last year's adopted budget and an increase in classified staff of a FTE from last year's budget. And then in addition to that, every allocation move that's been made from central special education department will not change students identified service needs outlined in each student's individualized education education plan and the district will continue to train and support the staff that serve the students in IDP related needs and the system move or model of school based support. And and if a student requires a specific need that continue to provide. So sure, I forgive my ignorance. One of the groups that we speak to early on in process, many, many hearings and certifications is smalloma ESD and to my understanding it sounds like they provide some of the services that you're describing now. And so I guess my question is, is there like an overlap between what you're doing with your FTE and what they can provide in their smorgasbord of services? And if there is, is that a more efficient way to serve that need by getting more help from the esd. Just curious. So we access MESD for a few things. One of the services we access them for is our nursing services that we have in all of our buildings. In addition to that, we access them for specialized student placements and so they serve and support us in that way. Outside of that, as a district, we provide and serve our needs. Okay.

A: I have a follow up just being a parent on the, on playgrounds, you know, we hear reading the news. I have a neighbor with two students with special needs. They're both, they both have feeding protocols and so news about reduction in the feeding team. It's like, well, what about my kids? Are they going to be okay? We have a. There's a point two FTE PE teacher at our school. We have ISC classrooms at our neighborhood school. That zero point two PE teacher has been providing adaptive PE for that class. Again, that's going away next year for some of the reasons you've talked about some of the shifts in model. And I think what I'm curious is like, what. How are you communicating with parents and communities that, especially with the most vulnerable students about, like, about safety, about like ensuring those needs are met even though, you know, even though there are cuts or changes to the services? Because I think that's like what's not coming, that's not what's coming down to the, you know, we hear it from the principal level or from a news article and then there's some measure of panic or concern in families.

start time: 868:35:32.000

B: Yeah, no, I appreciate the question. We actually, throughout the spring we've reached out to each one of our families that are served in our specialized classrooms and we've invited them to engagement sessions. Specifically, our family liaisons hosted these where we have facilitated that conversation with what is happening versus what has been heard about. And those actually they've wrapped up. We are talking about continuing a couple, but those are posted on our website and we're talking about how to continue to communicate those out. But that's one of the ways that we're doing that. The other thing that is something that I want to just put out there is that the message is, is that we aren't having some of these specialized teams anymore. And that's actually not accurate. We will continue to have specialized teams and experts, but our focus is to not have one centralized medical model support system. We want to increase the capacity of our specialists across the system to serve kids because that way we're not impacting the services students could have. We still will have an expert because we have students with significant needs that our, our staff will need to consult with in every opportunity. I get to communicate that out. We continue to do that. So in addition to that, we will continue to have adapted Penn. We have just staffed to our level this year. So anyway, those are a couple ways that we are continuing to try innovative.

A: Sharing some of the things that I've heard. But I'm curious, just on that you started, you mentioned capacity building, like in all of our communities. I'm curious if there's some of that capacity building work just around how. Like the shift to a neighborhood model, a more inclusive inclusion model like that, the capacity building and professional development for your administrators and, you know, general education teachers to kind of move to that model and be able to talk and communicate about that model. So there, there isn't that maybe fear in the same way?

confidence: 0.92
B: Yeah, it's. Thank you for that question. It's a significant shift for the system. That is one of the reasons why we're approaching it with such intention and going very slowly to do it well. And so that's why we started with two schools this year and we're moving to six next and then we'll approach it in that manner. And consequently, we're engaging very intentionally with the staffs of those schools to help support just exactly what you're talking about.

B: Thank you. Following the recent school closures due to extreme weather events, how is PPS evaluating its emergency preparedness protocols and what we mean by that? Not just the snow and ice that prevents people from traveling safely to the schools, but when there's physical damage to the school, which I believe happened last winter to at least a couple of schools, you had some downtime for an extended period of time. Are you evaluating what could be done to help mitigate those impacts and particularly as it affects instruction for the kids? That'll be a. Dan, thank you for the question. Following that January storm, we are definitely going through and evaluating our emergency preparedness protocols to ensure that we're better equipped in the future. It's worth noting that that January storm was, was pretty unique. It's not common that we have storms that are, that have that much cold for that long that causes the governor to declare a state of emergency. We have staff, we, we have some Armenia staff have been here for over 40 years. They don't recall anything to that level. But that said, you know, it was a unique storm and it did cause pretty significant damage. So we are in the process of completing a comprehensive after action report to see where we can improve. And some of those areas that we're specifically looking at is reviewing our communication strategies. We have lots of people to communicate to tens of thousands of students and parents. We also have our staff. We have our staff that are in the buildings. Our staff that need to report during these these instances. So there's lots of different ways and different messages that need to be captured communicated in these type of events. Looking at our coordination with our local utility companies and other emergency providers and other responses. So those are some of the categories in the after action report. I think it's worth noting that our modernized schools and our updated schools did not experience severe damage really are much older aging facilities that had impact we had I think it was 21 schools total that had damage. So from not too much damage to schools that had to be closed for an extended period of time. So that just highlights the need to prioritize investing in replacing responding to our agent building systems or roof systems or window systems or mechanical electrical systems. That's in a nutshell and that was really our follow up is you know are you evaluating it from the perspective of what you can do to prevent this from it's kind of incidents, you know causing more physical damage to schools as you plan your capital for. Yeah, absolutely. One of the things district is doing is planning for a future general obligation bond. We're executing right now. We're planning for a future one right now in the sample option there's significant dollars to consider for maintenance. We know our biggest problems are our building systems mechanical electrical, plumbing. Then our exteriors are I was going to ask what would be examples of those kinds of investments would be what you just H vac plumbing in particular. Roofs have actually gotten quite of attention. Roofs have done actually pretty well but a lot of other systems have not. And so our plumbing is a big one variable pipes we actually have in my office like just some of the pipes that came out these buildings they don't like they're 80 do well prolonged reason back in the day they used to be made of wood. They were different. Allison.

B: Yeah, that's a good question. Back in April the Jefferson project team presented a new all new construction option for Jefferson High School to the board of education and we are proceeding forward with that with that model that Revised plan has an estimated cost of 491 million, which is 125 million over what the existing general bond funds can fund. So with that general obligation bond that we're planning for the future, the the funds necessary to complete Jefferson are included in that package. So that is where the remaining funds will come from. What we call a future. A future bond. Regarding lessons learned, there are lots and one we just noted here. It's important on in particular, Jefferson is a unique project. It's over 100 years old. That building. It's. It's four stories. It has some historic features to it. It's on a very tight site. Is to bring the general contractor in as early as we can. When you have these unique. When you're building something brand new, it's fairly straightforward for a design team to design it. A professional cost. Estimated. Estimated. And then that's, you know, what we build our budgets on. This is such a unique project. It's really hard for the designers to understand it. Capacity for the estimators to estimate all the needs in the sequencing and pleasing of this type of project. That was one of the big challenges that once the contractor came on site and was able to do more accurate cost estimates, there was lots of phasing type of costs that were missed. The other is construction cost escalation continues to be extremely high and extremely high in the Pacific Northwest system, every country. So building in more contingencies, building in larger projects are all things that we are trying to do as we go. As a followup in the past, I know for some of the high school.

A: And continuing on the bond conversation. The last couple of years we've talked about kind of trying to drill down into what the center for Black Excellence will be as one of the Bond projects highlighted in the 2020 school facilities bond in the last couple of years. Heard from you about the community engagement work to see what that would look like, what's needed, what would the facilities and capital projects possibly be? So we'd love an update on the latest progress. What's the status of the center for Black Student Excellence? Is it. Do we have a build, you know, where. Where are we at in that conversation?

start time: 1041:22:50.000
end time: 1070:27:20.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I'm happy to jump in with that. We, as you, as we've shared before, we've had a lot of community engagement. I can't remember the number, but I know it was over 100 engagements with the community to think about and conceptualize the center for Black Student Excellence and where. And because of that, we now have a vision document around the center. And we think of it as a place, a physical place, an approach to teaching students who are black or African American, and a redesign of the system which we know doesn't always support those students to their maximum extent of their ability. So those sort of the three prongs we think about the physical infrastructure. The plan right now is for the center to be approximately 45,000 square feet and for it to share a structure with a K5 learning lab. So it'll be on and a part of a existing school site. The PK5 space is derived from our educational specifications. So to be built as if we were building as it will be a new elementary school in pps. And then from the engagement and functional goals of space programming, space needs were designed and developed. And so we can get you a copy of the Vision document, but it has some imaginings of what spaces will look like within the center and things like that. The next steps. And Dan could probably speak to this more than I can, but we need to do we need an architect to actually bring the Vision and some of the space designs to life and then engaging consultants who will continue to work on site planning. Because we still haven't landed my understanding on an exact physical location.

A: Do we have an idea of the timeline of Those projects? The 2020 bond is at this far in life. We just talked about how Jefferson is going to need the next iteration of the bond. Just give us a like, you know, big picture. How many 2020 bond projects, you know, are we gonna. Are we not going to finish before you have to go out for another bond? Yeah.

B: So right now the discussions are going after another bond in November of this year. We will still have significant funds from the 2020 bond to spend on. So there's going to be Several more years of work with 2020 bond work, which isn't unanticipated. The district has had this sort of overlapping bond sequence plan for over a decade now. And so we. I don't like the exact timeline, but we anticipate having all the 2020 bonds spent roughly next, let's say six or seven years to complete that work, and then the 2024 next bond, that work will overlap and will continue. Does that answer your question?

A: Yeah, I think so. And we'll be back in the fall to ask all of those bond questions and you get to see us again. It's great. I think with that, knowing that you have a board meeting immediately following this meeting.

B: Matt, go ask this question. Okay. Well, I would just want to say thank you all for your service on behalf of the district. Tough times. I know it's really tough and I really appreciate it as a parent. PBS Education. Education has been great for my daughters and an excellent experience. And now they're only be there for a couple more years. But I think the schools they. They've been to in the district has really provided them with a great education. So. So that's in preference. Preference. So my daughter, who is a sophomore in Grant, she has actually been to one of these meetings before. She knows that, I mean, that's legit. So she raised an issue that is near and dear to her heart. And please feel free to punt if you want, but if you could give me something to tell her, that would be great. We want to send you home as a champion. So apparently at Grant they are, but they are spending, this is, according to her, $60,000 on pouches so that she can't use her iPhone during school hours. And so she wants to know why they're spending money on keeping her iPhone prisoner when they're cutting a makerspace at the same time in the school.

C: Want to address that from a privacy standpoint. So I'm not going to speak to the specific Grant situation. I think it was in response to staff concerns and community concerns. I will say, just so she doesn't feel picked on, that there is a broader conversation about developing a comprehensive policy on cell phones in schools in the policy committee on each of the committee. So we've been actively discussing it. I think it's worth noting that Grant wouldn't be the first school in the metro area to use the. They're called yonder pouches. They're like you use at a concert. Mount Scott Learning center, which is a smaller alternative program, currently uses them. And from the staff and student perspective, they are very positive outcomes. They've had it for quite a while. And there's a lot more engagement with students, a lot less distraction in classrooms. And the students are free to use their phones after the school day and before the school day. But when they walk in school, they're focused on the classroom and also their relationships with their peers, not on their phone. So it may just be. Grant is the leader, not the only one. And the issue related to cost is a good one. We actually just yesterday we were talking about that cost because that may be the sort of entry point for other schools. That certainly would be a consideration of what the cost is. And there may be solutions other than buying the yonder pouch that could address the issue in different ways. It doesn't require an expenditure of funds. You can also talk to me about salary and compensation versus a one time purchase.
