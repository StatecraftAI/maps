A: Really good input that we should be taking and lunch is one of them. The thing about the safety issue though is that it's actually, I mean there's actually statistics on this about using your cell phone when you're out and walking around in the city is actually more dangerous than people who don't have it. So I don't know, I'm just, I think there's the desire, like there's a lot of great input. Lunch is one of them. And I just want to reiterate when I read through a lot of that or when I looked at a lot of that, the feedback lunch was one of the many issues. At the same time, there's also the desire, like what you want versus the reason behind it. And I feel like sometimes there's a disconnect between the reasoning and the, the desire. So I just want to be clear that there was a lot of input and I think we do need to continue to get student input in terms of how to implement this best so that students feel that it's done right, that it's done well. Yeah.

B: I want to add that we did get some parent input from Grant High School. They're also an important stakeholder group survey when I'm looking for the number. But 82% of I believe 168 responses, 82% believe Grant Smelter Pouch Policy has had a positive impact. 6% say no impact. 12% say it's had a negative impact. All 168 respondents are granted parents and caregivers, except for one whose student has already graduated. And so I think, you know, we do hear from people and that we tend to hear from people that are loud, that can make meetings and know how to provide comment. But we know that that's not everybody. And so I think there's a lot, you know, we're trying to balance here. I think that since we know the data shows that cell phones are addictive, I would expect that someone that's addicted to a thing wouldn't gladly give it up. And I've raised teenagers myself and it's hard at the dinner table to get phones out of their hands to have a home cooked meal. So that's anecdotal, but I want to just remind everyone that there are lots of stakeholders and all of the input is important and how we use that is important. Yeah, I mean we just. There's lots of voices to be heard.

E: Hi, how are we doing? All right, so first off, let's just say that I agree that it needs to be an all day band. But to start off with, I'm not going to give you my words. I'm going to give you the words of our head of security at Benson. My vision on cell phone ban has to do with safety here at Benson. I have witnessed fights that could have been prevented. Kids who were in the halls who wanted to jump another student, then they saw that student, followed him, texted his friends that come out of their class. These students then jumped them, violently kicked and punched them. It took eight staff members to break up the fight. I also witnessed students camping out in bathrooms texting other students to come to the bathroom. Then other students arrived, appear to pass off money in return. The students received marijuana vape device. This has happened a few times. Students also hide contraband in the bathrooms, then text others where they had hidden the items. Also, we are trying to keep students and staff safe by ensuring that all doors are secured and we monitor who's coming in and out of the building. When students are late from lunch, they text their friends to open the doors and they prop them open so they can get into the building. This creates a great safety issue for all who we are trying to keep safe. I would like to put a cell phone ban for the entire day. They have become a big security issue. So we need a cell phone ban.

But we shouldn't have cell phones at all with it. No exceptions, no lunch, no I'm going to teach my class and use cell phones. They should just be restricted. And personally, the yonder pouches are great. I visited Grant personally. I walked around that campus for an hour and a half. I looked really, really hard for cell phones. I didn't see one. And I'm one of the people that wrote the policy at Benson, and I can tell you, no, the policy is not working. Works in my classroom because I enforce it, but out in the halls it doesn't work. And when I wrote it, I knew it wasn't going to work because it's almost impossible to enforce if students are sitting there with their cell phones in their back pocket, in their backpack, or wherever they can access them at any time. We just can't enforce it even though we try. We got four security guards in Benson. They cannot enforce the entire hallway. All I can cover is my classroom. And I shouldn't have to. I shouldn't have to enforce a cell phone policy in my classroom. I should have to teach. That should be my job.

G: Hi, I'm Carrie Sombrano and I'm here to share my perspective on off and away except for lunch. I teach at Benson Tech and I'm a member of our cell phone committee. So I'm going to start with a quote of the PPS board draft, first reading proposed policy. Peer and student to teacher interactions are fundamental to learning and we must create the conditions that allow students to be engaged, focused teachers challenged so they can reach their full potential. That's your verbiage. And then this is my response to that. The proposed district cell phone policy as written in Section 2A, contradicts this commitment to change conditions and improve student lives and academic outcomes. Because students have access to phones during lunch. Therefore, it's permissible to have a phone at school in a backpack or bag during class, though it's required to be off and away. When a student has such access, they use their phone in the bathroom or hallway with little or no recourse by staff following off and away except for lunch guidelines. As the board has described in 2A, the burden of enforcement when students do not follow the guidelines falls again upon the teacher and other staff who happen to be in the hallways, and it is ineffective in such a scenario. All we can do is ask that they will Put it away. And when we move on, away from the student, they just take it out again. You might wonder how often this happens. Each time I walked in the hall today and every day, the majority of students had their phones out in my classroom, often away. But allowing accessible phones keeps teachers and staff in the middle, losing instructional time. This is me. Cell phones away. Earbuds out. The bell has rung. Or the bell for lunch and passing has not rung. Please put your phone in this pouch. Yes, the bell has rung, but you didn't hear it because you were playing a game on your phone. These interactions create confrontation and frustration on both sides and degrade the student to teacher interactions that are so vital to learn. This atmosphere undermines the conditions that allow students to be engaged, focused, and challenged so they can reach their full potential. Thank you to the board members who visited schools to see hallway reality of off and away. Except for at lunch.

I'm not sure if many of you heard this, but, like, I've kind of created a whole speech of like, more than just the phone policy. Unfortunately, you clarified that we're only talking about the phone policy today, so I'm just only gonna read those, like, paragraphs of my big speech.

H: Yeah, I also shared the Google Doc with JJ as well. He should also have it, but I can read it right here, right now. The new phone restrictions with the magnetic lock pouches for the inside the school buildings have been very shocking many students. Not only is this a poorly conceived plan, it can also be very dangerous. In case of emergency or post. We would need to contact families to let them know whether or not they're okay. Parents could be worried about their inability to contact their child to check and make sure they're okay. And if they're not, they should be. We should also be able to contact emergency services in case classroom phones or others in the building are out of service. Phones are more likely able to help us to literally just call for help at those times instead of giving ourselves away. So to criminals somehow, for some reason, students and other schools, students in other schools like Grant are saying yes with the phone ban, but me and my friends at McDaniel at McDaniel see the bigger picture. Yes, I saw that video on the K2 News YouTube channel and I hope you also saw it as well. I'm also not afraid to call out Poland or other news channel. Fox 12, Oregon Good day, Oregon who, with such a large number of viewers at home, should not make their opinion sound like a popular opinion or an exact fact. I agree that there's been a problem with students being distracted on their phones. However, implementing a phone ban phone ban districtwide is very excessive and punishes all students for just a small fraction of students that are just irresponsible with the phones that actually deserve to get penalized. In McDaniel, most students are responsible enough to put their phones in their own bags and we will still need our devices for educational purposes such as researching and scanning QR codes. There's also students that would want to listen to music to help them focus for their work. Some students really need that, especially if they have adhd. Like my friend Julius. Again, same person who made a rant video that supported me. In my opinion, it should be clear that we should be sticking to the old style of teachers putting their phones in like the phone boxes or like phone jails. That way it's not too secure that we can take them out quickly during an urgent situation instead of even thinking spending part of the school budget on these meta pouches. Students who refuse to comply can get punished and penalized and meet with the deans or principals. You just said we are facing budget cuts and yet the pouches are what we're spending part of our budget on. They're going to be money towards them and like instead of going putting it into better teaching tools and supplies as well as improving the classroom environment. So yeah.

A: So I think we do Take student input very seriously. And I think one of the things that has been highlighted in terms of worry about an all day band is that safety component. Now there's two separate things, right? There's one is allowed during lunch and one is safety when you're off campus. Right. And so taking student input would try to figure out we don't want to implement, the district should take this feedback back and not implement a system that would completely block access to any film. Like for example, just interestingly, when I was talking this morning with the principal at Cleveland again. But also this is the same thing that all the principals and teachers at places that are using pouches have said is that the pouches are just a neoprene bag. So in case of emergency you can break it open and access your phone. And that was important to them because when they have an open campus and there is something that happened off campus where they do need a contact, they can easily just rip open the pouches and get out their phone. So I'm not, again, I'm not trying to say the pouches are the answer, but one way to take in the student feedback. Thank you for the public comment. Is the concern about safety. And one way to implement that is to make sure that we don't implement a system where your phones are inaccessible when you're off campus. And I think that is an important thing. The policy that we're debating right now, yes or no during lunch, I feel is also a separate issue. Right. Because the implementation of it depends on how the schools in the district want to do it. And that needs to have student input from a policy perspective. The policy is just a direction. And so I just want to kind of acknowledge that your concerns are heard and we should be paying attention to make sure that we don't implement any system that would put any student in danger. Thank you.

start time: 773:30:50.000
end time: 785:57:20.000
confidence: 0.96
C: We said we aren't going to talk about how it gets implemented. But I guess the only scenario where I'd see that student safety is addressed is if you bought the yonder pouches. Because all the other solutions are not ones where you're carrying something around that you can rip open. So I mean, that, that example of you could still be safe if you're downtown Portland or you're at Lloyd center or, you know, whatever it is that you're doing off campus. I mean, I never stayed on campus and my kids didn't either when they were in high school.

end time: 809:15:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I was saying most of our kids leave campus. And you do have my kids. Generally, students do. And the solution that the example just gave, like, they'd be okay because that relies on having a yonder pouch. And I do think, again, it's a budgetary decision. So say, for example. So I also don't think we want to. I don't think we want to have a policy that we don't, like, try and enforce. So to say, well, it's in a direction, but like. But maybe we won't enforce it or enforce that piece of it. I don't think that's how we want to start out. But again, I think it's just a policy call of like. I don't think there's any disagreement of like that for the vast majority of the day. I think the board has been pretty clear and we will have a discussion about what to do about lunch, because that seems to be the last piece. Director Sullivan, you wanted to raise the issue of locked. I guess I'm not understanding what locked means versus off.

start time: 809:42:50.000
end time: 815:19:56.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Well, it would be in either a locked box or a pouch if it's. Because it sounds to me like you're saying having them off and away is useless because it's in, you know, it's in a pocket and it's in a backpack. It's still buzzing, it's still causing problems. So off, in a way, is useless.

start time: 815:23:08.000
end time: 817:58:36.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So for example, you have a lockbox. They go to their first period class, their phone gets locked there, and at the end of the day they go back to there.

end time: 822:47:06.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Yeah, in junior high, I mean, middle school, that would be fine. I think it's very hard in high school. That's what, that's what Lincoln has. And they're having the same problem with. In, you know, at breaks and lunch, kids have all.

start time: 823:12:34.000
end time: 825:35:54.000
confidence: 0.95
F: If you're saying so they have to move it, they have to go to another class, put it in another lockbox. That's still better than having a ring in your backpack.

start time: 825:36:42.000
end time: 828:16:24.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I guess I'm trying to understand, but if you were saying like locked away in all day, they just go someplace in the morning, lock their phone there, they don't need to. And then at the end of the day, they go back and get it.

end time: 836:36:04.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So, Director Sullivan, to. To help with that issue, because I was thinking about that, too. So if you remember from the original one. So in my amendment, I crossed off the entire 2A, which is the high school specific one, except for one sentence that says, so that the devices cannot disrupt students or the learning environment. And this is the one that. Thank you, Director Brent Mowers, that I suggested be put into the language. And it was.

end time: 848:32:28.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I deleted 2A, but then I copy and pasted that into B. And so right now it says, personal electronic devices must be off and away throughout the high school. And then I added that part back in so that the device cannot disrupt students when they learn environmental. So that is a standard. So if it's in your backpack and then it is put in a way that can disrupt the student mentally, you can interpret it however you want. So in this way, you can be as strict as you want. So if it's ringing and it's disrupting your concentration, that's disruption that can't be lost. So the reason I put that sentence in there is so that it allows as much enforcement as you need to make this work. If that makes sense.

start time: 848:34:04.000
end time: 849:02:00.000

start time: 849:35:00.000
end time: 861:32:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah, exactly. So if it's buzzing all day, that's disruption disrupting a learning environment. The issue I have with the word locked is that again, three years from now, someone might discover a better system. If some pouch companies are making tons of money right now, you can bet in the free markets, people are trying to figure out better ways to do this, and it's a big market for it. And having any specific language that says how to do it would be worrisome because then it may bar us from a better method in the future, if that makes sense. And that's the reason why I was adamant about putting the. So that the device cannot disrupt students.

B: With my own eyes. I saw a group of black and brown students missing the bell by a good amount of time. And those are the kids that we claim to want to.

C: And also say PPS was not successful with those students before there were cell phones. So it's what's happening in the classroom that makes the biggest difference. We know that high quality instruction makes the biggest difference. I just want to put that on.

A: The record and also for the record, teacher practices, standards and curriculum and understanding of how education also improves and teachers are constantly improving. How we taught today, how we teach today is way better than how we taught 20 years ago. Is it perfect? No. We still have a long ways to go. But the issue at hand is we still need to talk about reality. If you go visit Benson, you go visit Franklin, their principals are talking about how to get younger patches because things have gone so bad. They've gone bad again. And then you look at the schools that are seeing success as the ones that have adopted the patches or an all day policy. And the issue is enforcement. Enforcement in reality. So, like if you have exceptions here and there, you know, that's the policy that schools have. The reason I use the word status quo is pretty much every high school, almost every high school in our district has the exact same policy before, you know, this year, which is basically off and away during class and that has not been enforceable. And the ones that have seen success in enforcement and reduction in teacher stress and increase in, or sorry, decrease in referrals and discipline issues are the ones that have gone all day. And that pattern Seems to be repeating itself nationally as well. So when we talk about the UK for example, the entire country used to be off and away in classrooms they've gone to all day, and they're the ones that have seen the greatest increases in districts across the country. Same thing. We have the same pattern where the schools that have gone all day are the ones that are seeing success. The schools that have not are the ones that are falling back to old patterns. And again, it's not about. We're arguing about lunch. But the whole point is that we need to argue about reality, what has worked and what hasn't. And so far, all the evidence that we've seen so far shows that the all day one seems to be the only way that works. So until someone can find something better. But right now, we don't have that. I would ask, can we recess this conversation until after the facilities committee meeting? If you all want to continue at all?

C: Okay. I'm going to thank you for the discussion and for those who came to comment. I appreciate it. I do have one thing. I just want to note that currently using your cell phone to harass or bully other students is. Is currently not allowed by our policy. So if that's occurring, whether it's during the school day or non school day, it is already not allowed and that should be enforced. And it's not an argument for against the day. But I just want to note, like students, that's not permissible even if we didn't allow students. So if students were doing that at night and they were harassing another student, that would be a violation of our policy and subject to discipline in the district. With that, I'm going to adjourn the meeting.
