C: Your colleagues on the student council that we really appreciated the work. That would be great. And maybe Frank, you'll see some of your words in here somewhere. All right, so that was the breadth of our survey you have in packet for tonight and for anyone looking online, this is in the board packet online an executive summary of what we do in our call because we were asking three questions. What are you what do you hope sustains for the next superintendent? So what are your then we also what are the challenges that the new superintendent is going to face? What are the district challenges and what are the challenges that the new superintendent will get? What are the things he's going to get in his inbox right away? And then we switched it and asked what sort of leadership dispositions do you want in your next leader reporting public? And we got rich feedback across all of the interviews. So this is your executive summary. I know you've had a chance to see it. I'm not going to read I just wanted to flag it both for you and and for the any of your online viewers. But here's your pride points and I'm not going to read them. But you can see there's lots to be proud of in Portland Public Schools. And your commitment to equity came up in a couple different places. Your commitment to equity, progressive values and social justice. And lots of people noticed the board has a strong vision around closing achievement gaps. So across every group, parents, students, staff and community members notice that. So I think that really speaks to your vision as a board to be very equity minded and equity driven, both in your words and then in your expected actions as a result of your strong vision. Next, we summarize your challenges and complexities and what you'll see in a couple places is what was a pride point also was a challenge. So an example of that is facilities maintenance and modernization. Everyone recognized the good work you're doing now and almost everyone also recognized you still have a lot more to do. So you've gotten your word out about the importance of your aging buildings. But one of the things that came out pretty high, which probably is not to be you would probably have expected this, is that need to build trust, trust with staff, trust with the community, trust with your leaders across the organization. So that's kind of a high level of your challenges and complexities. And then the thing that the new superintendent is going to need to really attend to as they enter the organization. The next document you have tonight is the next superintendent criteria and we're going to do a deeper dive into that When I'm through with this part. But again, it's posted online for any online viewers and it is in draft form. So this is the board's document. It is based on us rolling up the themes from the leadership dispositions, the things that people needed in the next superintendent and is meant to represent what across all the engagement. We did what people are telling you, but ultimately this becomes your document and the document that we will be pushing out to your candidate pool and the document that you will base your selection process off of. So from a high level, here's the authentic and inclusive leadership. Transparent, ethical and courageous leadership. Experienced, strategic visionary, fiscal stewardship and advocacy, equity and cultural competencies. Probably a lot of the things that you as board members are hopeful for in your next superintendent. So with that, I'm going to shorten my part so you have time to really do a discussion around the next superintendent criteria and we can begin making that the document that you as the board want it to be. So with that, I'll stop sharing and I'm going to pass it to Steve to lead that next part of the process.

D: Thanks, Christy. Good evening, Portland Public Schools Board of Education. Delighted to join you and share my screen and I'll provide some background context relative to process here in just a moment. Christy or Hank, can you give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen?

D: As Christy mentioned, I know we all may be inclined to want to wordsmith and certainly will have an opportunity to provide that kind of input and feedback to Human Capital Enterprises. Know that we would like to receive that kind of suggested input feedback in your April 4 email that you're submitting to Kara. Kara will gather all of that and then provide that to Human Capital Enterprises. So our purpose really tonight is to solicit big idea feedback in two GO rounds. First, your general impression or reaction to the draft profile as presented. So everyone has had hopefully some time to review that and we'd like to just capture your first general impression relative to the draft profile is presented. Then the second go round will be asking for this kind of feedback. Are there draft criteria that are listed that you wonder about or you wonder if they should be included at all or rewritten in some form? Right. So it's the wondering kind of feedback or are there salient or materially important criteria that you believe are missing from this document and ought to be considered for inclusion? So it's what's missing and the wonder sort of feedback that we're inviting. Know that Christie is going to be recording comments in a document so that we have that captured as part of our deliberation. When we go back to revise this draft document, I'll be highlighting that in real time also for the audience who may be following online. So, for example, if it is a comment that you have about authentic inclusive leadership and the first bullet, if you could speak to that specifically, then I'll highlight that so that we can all call our reference point to that piece in the document. Again, general impressions. And we'll just do a sort of quick go round by a board member. And then the second go round is really focused on draft criteria that you wonder about or materially important criteria that you believe ought to be included. Any questions before we get started?

confidence: 0.95
D: We will be collecting any feedback that you may have in an email to Kara, but as you are making comments relative to your general impressions, we're going to be reporting that now in real time. And then secondly, if. If there is something in the document, again that you believe ought to be removed or you wonder about or materially important criteria that needs to be included, just highlight that for us. Speak to why. Because it's important to articulate rationale for us and certainly for your colleagues. Any questions? All right, let's start with general impressions. And Andrew, if you could go first, that would be helpful.

I wanted to come up with something, but as I read through it, I feel like you captured the things that I feel are important. You know, given from your report, you've captured the things that the community also expressed were important. So not only do I not have.

F: General impressions. You know, when I first read through it, I thought it's pretty vague, but it would be what any organization would be looking for in a leader. When I read it the second time, I really wanted to call out the first paragraph. Authentic inclusive leadership and how that's demonstrated, particularly because what I've heard a lot in the last several years has been we'd like a leader that's seen more in classrooms and out in the community. And I think someone that demonstrates their love of the diversity and the culture that is Portland is really fine. And I'm just curious what parts of the culture were known for cultural weirdness. And sometimes people see that through a.

F: I also was curious if the questions, when you were soliciting input, were the questions asked, what do we need in a new leader, considering the challenges and opportunities that are coming up in the future, or just generally, what are we looking for in a leader? I'm curious how you source the, how you got these results responses, if it was literally looking at what we need to solve in the next few years.

start time: 258:10:00.000
end time: 267:41:00.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Let me answer that for you. We didn't specifically say, as we scripted the question, given the challenges, but. And I think I facilitated about 20 focus groups and every person, almost every group to a T, reference those leadership dispositions related to this moment now. And so. And sometime we would prompt them, like, what does PPS need in this moment? And so they had just come off the question of challenges. So they were very interwoven.

confidence: 0.92

So I'm appreciating Michelle for her pushback on you because I don't want you to think that this is easy. I was hoping to see in here. Maybe I missed it. Accountability that we would be. The superintendent would be one that is fond of holding people accountable as well as holding themselves accountable to what they put out there. And maybe I missed it.

confidence: 0.96
D: Thank you, Herman. I do want to point out for audience members who may be listening, that that is included in the desired characteristic Theme experience strategic and visionary educational leadership. It's the third bullet effectively designing systems of support and accountability. Julia.

start time: 308:37:40.000
end time: 432:53:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I know you saved me for this point in time so I could add points since nobody else did or they were limited. Oh you've got some. So I'll just run through at a high level because I try not to word smooth but more just a big concepts that having been my third time fourth time through a recruitment process I would given the board goals and the importance that they hold for us move up the experience strategic and visionary education leadership so that it's at the very top. Somehow I want to be at the very opening lines that like the expectation that we want a superintendent who has moved student achievement and that's what we want. That's going to be very important. It's also going to be important how it's done. But I feel like we start with the how versus the what and then just there's I'll just say authentic and inclusive leadership and this could be fall into the category of like preferred. You can obviously like preferred required but somebody who's worked in a state that has a strong union representation. I know from previous recruitments that lots of states don't necessarily have that and I think it's a very different operating environment. And if that's all you've operated in, I think it would be a challenge here because we're a state which our labor partners are have a very strong presence in our in our schools. So somehow again to me that would be a preferred experience. Like Michelle, I would like to have culture defined more because when I think of culture I think what I went to and then I was kind of laughing when you went to the weird culture because that is like another thing. I think people talk about the Portland culture but I'm thinking of the culture of a team since the superintendent is not going to be the one by themselves driving improvements in student achievements but really this team leader. But it takes a team of leaders. It takes a team of teachers to get our work done. So how does at the very top that gets set? So I'm interested in more of a definition like how we define the type of culture that we want somebody because everybody has a culture but some of it's toxic. So being more descriptive, this next comment applies to a whole host of the bullet points. For example, the ability to make tough decisions or the ability to articulate act upon a future focused strategic plan. I would add the word demonstrated. I think people's past experience and we're not going to find Somebody who has all the things we want. But I do think we want somebody who not just can articulate it, but actually has demonstrated they've done some of these things. On the third bullet point, on experience, strategic and visionary educational leadership, I had a. On the third bullet point effectively designing systems, I have a suggested ad, but it could be added in a number of places, like not only effective design, but also implementation. So we can have great plans, but if they're not, if somebody can't effectively implement them, then they're just another set of plans. So really this. I feel like we have a lot right now of the base, the foundation in place, and it's continued implementation of our plans and doing it effectively and building a culture of like we're going to, as a team, implement. Again, we can have some of these very visionary creates a lot of plans, but if things aren't implemented, then that doesn't have an impact on our students. Under the proven fiscal management, I'm not quite sure conceptually what the exact words I would add, but I'd be interested in somebody who has had some experience in challenging fiscal conditions because I think it's a muscle that makes you think differently about how to deploy your resources and how to prioritize them. And again, that may be like a preferred versus required. To me, that's something. And then there's nothing in here that talks about the capital piece. And we have $2 billion in capital bonds and another one coming. And so. So we have fiscal management, but also we have the second largest property owner, I think, in the city of Portland. And somehow including that in there, then the other just big pass is in the very last equity and cultural competency leadership, it says demonstrated success in eliminating disparities and systems. Systemic racism. I think that's a big. That's a big statement. So it's like, is it in the school context or it seems like we should be more specific about if we have institutional racism or systemic racism or is it the racism our students experience? It's just. It's a big requirement and statement. And I don't know that there's anybody who's eliminated systemic racism versus made improvements in eliminating it. And this is just for. For me, I would prefer. My last one is just I would prefer to have an experienced somebody who's been a superintendent already. So I think if we can find something, I have hired lots of number twos or other people and seeing them grow into the position, I also think to go to the next level, it would be if we can find Experienced superintendent who's a good fit for our state to have somebody who is not learning that part of the job.

confidence: 0.94
G: Yeah. Thank you. I'm starting to feel I was forgotten for a moment. Overall, I love this document. The first thought that comes to my mind is, good luck finding someone who can fit all these. It seems very difficult, but it does prioritize. I do really like a lot of things. There is one thing I do want to add. I do want to also continue what Directors of Pass & Brim Edwards are kind of pointing out. As I'm looking at this, there's a lot of things that I feel like kind of fit into a specific category, you know, like managing the budget or strategy, district vision. You know, there's a lot, you know, this is a job where not one person can do it all right. And so it's very important to be able to keep a team. And this idea that I have, the suggestion kind of came up when I was talking about in a conversation with a friend, one of the. And this is again, I want to make sure this is not a criteria about our current staff. I'm talking about historically, one of the things that Portland has. PPS has struggled with is kind of retaining effective.

E: Staff.

start time: 463:43:52.000
end time: 471:31:56.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Right. And so one of the things I want to. Would like to highlight because a lot of these bullet points kind of hint at it. And so I don't know, I was hoping maybe we could bring it out to the forefront and just really just say, like, you know, I don't even know how we do it. I guess that's up to you to create a criteria or a proven track record of someone who has a track record of creating, not only creating, but retaining effective teams.

start time: 471:35:08.000
end time: 471:41:48.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Right.

start time: 471:42:44.000
end time: 490:47:30.000
confidence: 0.94
G: And I think that retention part is important because one of the things with historically PPS has struggled with is retention. I know that education is a high turnover profession. I mean, that's just how it is in the United States. But, you know, there's a lot to be gained when we have teams that, you know, not only proven to be highly effective, but stick around. So. And that really helps when we do see that kind of thing. So that's probably the one Thing I would add. And the reason, it's kind of a general things because a lot of these fit into it. You know, like for example, when we're talking about inclusive leadership or supports and accountability, you know, these are things that help create that kind of culture for keeping our staff around. So yeah, that's the only thing. But otherwise I really do appreciate, I think a lot of these bullet points do reflect really well what a lot of our staff, community members and students have desire for and felt. So thank you.

A: Well, I know you said wanderings were going to be the second round, but my first like impression was a wondering. So I hope that's okay. I guess just like right on that first bullet point. I was also looking at the first half where it talks about exhibiting a deep connection, commitment to the community. And I was wondering like what community that was referring to if it meant just like pps. Because then the second half of it talks more about like the broader city. So does it mean like overall Portland community or specifically pps? And then overall, I thought it was really thorough and like everything that was put here, definitely I saw that reflected in the conversations I've had with district student council and other students. I think you all did a great job. And everyone at the district student council looked at this and their first impression was they loved it. I don't know if you all know what this means, but they said that you all cooked and yeah, they just really loved it and they loved the opportunity to speak with you. So thank you.

I would just kind of add when we talk about culture, that we're talking about culture, competence and competence, especially in the system that we're in, make sure that that is something that we look for as well. And also, you know, when I think of the superintendent piece, making sure that they can have like a collective capacity building system, they can speak to that as well. Because we know, you know, superintendent, a lot of it is delegation, you know, and reviewing and assessing, you know, the work that they are delegating. So I will try to bring some of that in there as well. And also making sure, I don't know, I didn't read, I read it all the way through, but I could be missing as well. Making sure that, you know, they're children centered, that this is what, this is what they're here for. We want to make sure that they have children in mind, you know, in every, each and every decision that they make, because this is a job that we're hiring for. That's it for me.

confidence: 0.92
E: Yeah, just one quick comment, sort of circling about to what my colleagues talked about, and specifically Director Vermetter has talked about having someone with experience, which I don't disagree with any of that. Obviously, if we have two candidates, one who are both equal in every other way, one has experience and one doesn't, then by all means write the one with experience. I guess I would just want to make sure we don't write criteria that would limit the ability of someone who may not be enough front roll from applying, who may think, oh, well, they're not looking for a second. That would be my own clarification because I think sometimes finding those people who don't have the experience can also a really good candidate can be better than someone who's set in their ways and has done this process before.

Now, in addition to receiving our revision, there also is public feedback that that might well come. In fact, I think some have already come in and we'll also send you the feedback from the Public. So our aspiration is that you'll get that by Friday evening and you'll be able to reflect not only on a revised document, but also what you're hearing from the public. It might also be. I want to just ask, is there public testimony in this meeting? I guess that's a question for Kara. Are there folks the public will be speaking?

E: Okay. And I know there's also an opportunity at the subsequent meeting that starts at 6:00. So that's our next steps and then we will return. Well, I'll be with you at the 6pm meeting as well because there is an agenda item which is similar to what we're talking about just to give public more opportunity to engage with us. But then on the 9th is when you will see a revision. You'll have already seen the revision, but we'll bring you the revision in public space. There'll be an opportunity for public testimony. There'll be an opportunity if there's still some last edits or changes. And then we'll ask you to adopt the criteria. Okay. Hearing no questions. Are we good with that?

E: Peace.

start time: 611:00:34.000
end time: 619:54:10.000
confidence: 0.94
I: And when we get the broader community involved and kind of get a sense from some of the conversations I've had with my colleagues that getting to that transparency and getting the broader community involved at the finalist level is something I think that I've talked to some of my colleagues and they have agreed at that point because. And have that transparency piece elevated from what we're doing now.

I: Well, no.

start time: 623:28:30.000
end time: 643:01:20.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah, I think I agree. I think what I'm hearing is we'll keep a confidential process at first and then once we have finalists, then it would be more transparent. And I think. Hank and company. Isn't that what you recommended when we first met a couple months ago? Or are you maintaining that we maintain confidentiality throughout the process? I just want to say, you know, Portlanders are very engaged, very engaged. And so I think that what I heard you guys say is that it's important in order to get a really good candidate, a strong candidate, that we need to maintain their confidentiality until at least the finalist stage. And then. Are you saying Even throughout the entire interview process. What I'm trying to figure out is if there's a way to maintain confidentiality until there is a finalist or down to two finalists. At some point, if you're a finalist for a position, you do have to go back and tell your boss or your seven bosses that you. That you're a finalist and that you may be, you know, you may be leaving.

start time: 643:08:20.000
end time: 643:26:52.000
confidence: 0.72
E: Sure, I'll.

start time: 643:29:16.000
end time: 644:50:40.000
confidence: 0.86
F: So I'm not sure how to not an HR professional, walk that path.

start time: 644:59:00.000
end time: 667:06:30.000
confidence: 0.94
E: So I would, I would say this. I'll give two answers. So the first question is, what was our recommendation? Our recommendation was, and still is that to enjoy the broadest pool and the most highly talented candidates to go into your pool. Our recommendation is that you engage in a search in which finalists are not named. Finalists are not named, and the only name that is released is the name of the new superintendent at the point that there's public vote. That was and is our recommendation. The other option, and it is absolutely a board decision, is to release the names of folks at the point that there are finalists. And typically that number is two or three. That would be, I think, the only other viable option. I didn't hear much interest, and I'm grateful that I didn't hear much interest in trying to do these things sooner than that. That would be virtually unheard of in our region of the country and would be. Would be a real challenge to attracting candidates. But I'm not really hearing a lot of board energy around that. So really, I think the choice for the board is are you releasing the names once there are probably two or three finalists, or are you not releasing any names until there's only one lead candidate or superintendent? That's really, I think, where I hear the energy and I hear the conversation.

start time: 667:48:10.000
end time: 673:21:32.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I thought I heard also that you will have groups of people from that community interviewing the final candidates and they will be, you know, they would interview, they would not share with the rest of the public. So it's not as if nobody from the public would be interviewing when we.

start time: 673:21:56.000
end time: 673:50:52.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Got down to the final two or.

start time: 673:51:16.000
end time: 674:37:16.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Three, that is our recommended process. You're absolutely right.

start time: 674:39:48.000
end time: 674:53:20.000
confidence: 0.73
G: Okay.

start time: 675:33:40.000
end time: 701:08:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So I think the one just, I guess, finesse is I thought your recommendation was that we got to a finalist versus a superintendent, because a superintendent means that we've made a decision. And to me, a distinction would be down to a finalist candidate that we're recommending moving forward to be considered to be the superintendent versus were reviewing the superintendent so that, that my, my preference is and found through processes that and sometimes you just. I think boards just know when they get there is that they have a leading candidate and it's like, okay, this is the time to introduce them to the. To the community versus, we don't know about either one of these, but we're going to, you know, put the both of their names out. My preference would be one finalist, but not one superintendent. And I think that's what gets us the best candidate pool and also requires the board to really have a. Come together and be really firm and like, this is the person that we think should lead.

start time: 701:34:20.000
end time: 708:43:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I have a question for the board. Like, what would the purpose of. Like, well, obviously be more transparent about it. Like, what would we aim to get out of that? Because I think if we're going to do that, we need to be really clear about, like, the level of input the community is going to have. Because if you do that, I think people are going to assume that they're meant to be giving feedback in that moment. We're, like, gonna be listening to that in that direct way. So I was just wondering what are people's thoughts and if we know what.

start time: 708:44:10.000
end time: 709:12:30.000
confidence: 0.98
E: The actual aim of that would be.

start time: 709:34:50.000
end time: 727:45:00.000
confidence: 0.92
I: Yeah, that's a great question, I think. And that's something that I'm hoping that Hank and Associates can put together. I mean, Hank and Human Enterprises can put together, but exactly that, Right? It's exactly to have input from the community. Community. Not that we are going to, you know, go by, but one thing that I've learned in marriage, right, is, you know, even though I'm the head of the household, it's wise that I listen to my wife's counsel. Right? And so, you know, I think that's the same thing with, you know, what we're doing now. It is wise for us to listen to our community and also to see how they interact with the community. For instance, if it's a community forum, see how they interact with the community, see how they move within different communities as well. I think that's important because it's in such a public. Such a public position that, you know, we want to make sure that that person feels confident in that position as well, and we can evaluate and see how they are in that position. So that kind of thought process.

H: It's an amazing opportunity to connect with other school board members from across the. From across the United States, from pretty much almost every state we have represented presentation and I Had an opportunity to speak with other school board members about their processes. Not telling them about. I said, what did y'all do? Just ask questions. What did you do? And then, yeah, I asked questions. And then I also had the opportunity to reach out to superintendents, actual sitting superintendents of current school districts right now. And I asked about the process, and I said, you know, when it gets there, to the. The last two people, right. You know, we're. We're getting. We're getting down to like, the last. The last couple. Is that a big. Is that a deal breaker if we know that one of these two people are going to get the job? And the superintendents, with the exception of two, I spoke to 10. So I didn't speak to everybody. I just did a round number, because if you go more than that, then the odds are different. But with the exception of two superintendents, they said that it wouldn't be a deal breaker if they knew that one of these two people were going to get the job and they knew that their name was. Wasn't going to be shared until the last minute. Like, we're not going to be sharing it until we know one of us is walking away from. Walking away with the job. So to say that we wouldn't. We wouldn't get a. We wouldn't get good people is disingenuous because there's a lot of people out there, or at least the ones that I spoke to. So I shouldn't say a lot because 10 is technically not a lot of people. That's. That's not a lot. It's just easy. For good math. It's a small sample size.

H: It's a small sample size. Of that small sample size, 80% said it wouldn't be a big deal. 20. 20% said they wouldn't apply if they knew that. So that is something to take into consideration that you would lose people. Of the 80%, three of them were female. I don't know if that matters at all.

F: I have a comment about that. We talked earlier about delegation, and I feel like I know I'm not an HR expert, and I've never done an executive search in my life. That's not my best background. And so we hire you for your level of expertise to complement what we don't know. And I feel like, you know, I'm tempted to go with what you recommend in terms of getting the strongest candidate.

start time: 774:23:30.000
end time: 779:49:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, me too. I think we should go with your recommendation. And if we don't, we definitely have to let. We will know what we're going to do. And we can't at the last minute say, oh, we're down to two. And they're thinking we weren't going to say anything till the last one.

start time: 779:51:40.000

H: I think it was. I think the whole point of this was to establish a game plan from the beginning that whatever it is we're going to do, we're going to let everyone know up front. The point of this conversation is to establish, as I understand it, what that game plan is. It's never been part of the deal as to where we're going to change our minds along the way. We make our minds today or we establish it today, and then so goes the rest of the rest of the ship. It is what it is. And with Hank and Human Capital Enterprises, their job is, as I understand it, is to make a recommendation. It is not to tell us what we can or cannot do. It's our job to make that determination because we're actually paying them like they get paid. And so that means that they work for us. So we establish the criteria. They give us input as to. These are some of the best practices. These are some of the things that I've solved. This is what I've seen to work. And these. These are. But at the end of the day, we paid them to do a job, so that's okay.

E: I support keeping the process confidential up until the finalist, and I would say whether that's two or three, I think at that point, I think Frankie's point is really excellent. One, we don't just want to release the names. In order to release the names. We want to release the names because we've created a process at the end, whether that involves, you know, created a town meeting or some other kind of, you know, forum and something that we're. Is part of the evaluation process. But I think that I want to get the best candidates. I kind of agree with Director Green. I'm not sure it's going to scare that many candidates away at a finalist stage. And I think the candidates does scare away. We kind of need to ask the question as to why I've hired a lot of executives.

confidence: 0.95
E: I've been recruited for things, and I've never been promised confidentiality. So for me, I'm also struggling a little bit with why superintendents are different than other positions. And so anyway, all that's to say, I think you know, maintaining the confidentiality at the end, but, you know, at the end of the process, I think our community needs to know who our two or three finalists are. And we need to have a process by which we gain some final input on that.

confidence: 0.95
G: Do I have to say something about it? I mean, I can go either way because I see pluses, minus for both sides. I do support. I mean, I trust the experts who have done this over and over again many, many times. But at the same time, I also understand the values and ethics behind transparency. My thing. And again, reiterating what Director Silverstein pointed out earlier, women and leaders of color always are under more scrutiny than everyone else. And if this is going to cause them trouble, you know, we have to remember the human aspect of it. And I think it's important to maybe even have the candidates input on whether this is going to be okay for them. You know, if so, I guess that's where I am. But if we decide in a process where we are confidential up until the finalists, I'm okay with that.
