confidence: 0.95
B: Thank you so much. Chair thank you. And thank you, Board. This is our first opportunity to be with you after you selected us for this very significant honor and this very significant moment in time in public schools. So on behalf of my team, Christy, Tammy, Hector, Steve and others who are not with us tonight who are working in the back, Kathleen and Jay and Robin, we thank you for this and we look forward to partnering with you and helping you in this transition find an excellent new superintendent of schools. What I'd like to propose that we do tonight is three things. One is I'd like to go over what does a typical Human Capital Enterprises search process look like? Not the Portland public specific one, but in general, what does it look like when we run a search? And I think that will be a good way to sort of start some conversations about what it should look like in Portland. And so we'll do that. Hector's going to help me. We'll go through some slides and talk about what it looks like. And then we're going to move to. I'd like to next go into, ask Christy to lead some conversation around the engagement work. And the engagement work is the very first thing that really we have to take on after, really after tonight. Engagement takes some time to plan and some time to execute. And so even though we won't have created a design tonight, it's worthwhile to move into the engagement sooner rather than later. We're here in February. We want to make sure that we're engaging with your community. So I won't say anything more on that, except Christy will talk about that a bit later. And thirdly, we want to engage in a conversation and maybe facilitate a conversation. We've heard the board talk about the notion of a committee of the whole, meaning the entire board doing pieces of work, and the notion that maybe there should be some work groups consisting of some members of the board doing bodies of work. And so Steve and Tammy are going to facilitate that conversation. We will stay no later than 7pm here this evening. That's our, that's our plan. Is that all right?

B: Okay, we're on the clock. All right. Hold these. These may or may not work. We're hoping, we're, we're hoping they do. We can come back to this. But if so, we would like to begin the engagement work next Tuesday, which is February 27th. And we would like to come back and do a continuation of the planning meeting, the second planning meeting on Tuesday, March 5th. Let's come back to that and see if that's Doable. But right now that would be our proposal. If those dates don't work, then somewhere in that vicinity should work. We got a board meeting that night.

B: Okay. So again, the next slides are about a. I want you to think generically. This is what we typically do in our searches. And later we're going to move into specifically, what would it look like in Portland public? What could it look like in Portland public? I'm going to turn over my colleague Hector, who's going to talk about what does focus group and engagement typically look like. Hector, take it away. All right. Good evening, board members. I'm happy to join you from the.

start time: 144:44:56.000

end time: 150:44:00.000
confidence: 0.96

start time: 154:29:46.000
end time: 155:24:34.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Through our survey in English or Spanish.

start time: 155:26:42.000
end time: 157:44:18.000
confidence: 0.94
E: We'Ll obviously work with the district if other languages are needed, since they know that, since they'll know the community better.

start time: 157:46:34.000
end time: 158:09:22.000
confidence: 0.94
B: And we'll be able to know how.

start time: 158:09:46.000
end time: 160:45:30.000
confidence: 0.94
E: To, how to prioritize and really reach out to them. Well, so those are the two stages early on that we, that we'll start.

start time: 161:05:10.000
end time: 161:11:58.000
confidence: 0.80
A: Great.

start time: 161:12:54.000
end time: 173:48:38.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Thanks so much, Hector. So, as Hector described, we do engagements which we do focus groups and we do one on ones with board members. And we, we meet with a number of constituents, whether they're staff, families, parents, community members, and we also reach out through a survey. And that last bullet point, I'll just say we often get asked and I assume that it will be important in Portland Public Schools to think about how do we reach folks who aren't the ones who are going to fill out online surveys, how do we do that? And we've got some strategies, but the folks who actually usually have the best strategies are the folks who are working in your departments that are engaged in outreach to communities. And so we would work with them to think about how do we do that most effectively and to hear and to elevate voices that are not always elevated.

start time: 173:51:04.000
end time: 174:31:10.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Question what is the purpose of the surveys?

start time: 174:46:10.000
end time: 209:33:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So great question. So both, both the survey and the focus group have two objectives. One is to school us up on Portland Public Schools. We don't live in this district. We don't come to work here every single day. We don't send our kids to pps. We all have some connection, but it's not nearly as deep as what you board members and folks who come and work and live Portland Public Schools every day. So part of it is for our team to learn the district well enough that we can represent you well when we go out to recruit. And the second piece, I think this brings me to my next slide. Chair Hollins. Yes, the second piece, the second outcome of why do we do that survey and why do we have the focus groups is we're going to come back to you, board, at some point in the near future with a document that we call the next superintendent Criteria. And we're going to say to you, board, this is what we've learned from your community. This is what we're hearing from your community. This is what we think your community wants you to focus on in terms of the profile of the next leader. That document often has some leadership qualities that are in the, I would call them soft skills. I don't think that's the right word, but they're the skills that are about how you lead, how you engage with people. Are you a great communicator Are you visible in the schools? Are you great with finances? We get some of that and we also get some. That's more the resume stuff. Some folks are going to be really wanting you to focus on somebody who's been a superintendent before. Others are going to say that might not be so important, but they really need to love Oregon or the Northwest because we don't want the rain to scare them away. And I don't mean that flippantly. We hear that. We hear that when we do searches in this part of the country. So it's a combination of kind of qualities that you would see or experience when you engaged with somebody who you worked with and the qualities or experiences that you would see on a resume when you apply. Christy, anything you would add to that?

start time: 209:47:30.000
end time: 223:28:08.000
confidence: 0.96
D: No. It also. Well, yes, a little bit. Serves as a roadmap for you to even ask about what interview questions you ask. So the things you hear in the survey will be presented to you first as themes and then as the profile as I've seen it done. And then it helps you as the board to know how are you, because you're representing a community. And so you're going to take those themes, you're going to take that ideal profile. And then after you adopt it, then you go into the interview process and you can use what you learned from your community meetings that we present to you in order to structure the next part of the process. It might feed into how you. What sort of a on demand task you ask candidates to do. It might feed into interview questions.

start time: 223:31:04.000
end time: 223:38:32.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Yeah.

start time: 223:39:36.000
end time: 224:19:00.000
confidence: 0.93
D: But it kind of guides your next step of the work.

start time: 224:36:00.000
end time: 235:12:20.000
confidence: 0.93
F: This is a slightly pedantic point, but one I think is important is distinguishing between the engagement we're doing with different folks is going to. We should, we should be clear about what we're getting. So engagement with board members, like you know what we want in the superintendent engaging with. With senior staff. They know what they want in the superintendent engaging with the broader community. Most of them never met the superintendent. They know what they want from the school district. And that's an important distinction. And it's important for us to hear what they want from the school district because our superintendent search is for a superintendent who will take the school district in that direction. But I don't want to misread what we're hearing from them because that's what they wanted. A superintendent if they've never met.

start time: 235:33:20.000
end time: 235:51:52.000
confidence: 0.92
B: You're 100% right.

start time: 235:53:36.000
end time: 255:48:36.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So just playing off of that. So I was thinking along the same line. So we want somebody who's going to help us achieve our board goals. And my guess is 98% of our families may not know exactly what those board goals are. So I wonder if as part of like the framing that they're going to be acquainted with what they expect to accomplish. They can add their things in. But also what. I guess maybe one of the things I worry about, we ask an open question and I think it's going to be probably end up be things like communication. I mean things that are things that they, they can see as somebody who. And then all of a sudden we hire, then we say hire somebody who's going to actually has a track record of being able to meet our goals and be like they didn't listen to us because we said X and they went with Y. So I'm wondering if there's like in the process of doing that there's also a, like here's where the district is heading and we're interested. You're part of the system. What you see how the superintendent facilitates that.

start time: 255:51:08.000
end time: 280:18:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So let's, let's. Those are all great points and remember we're looking at kind of how the general template looks like. But I will say that, I will say this to you and these are spot on points. I mean you're absolutely right in terms of the caliber. I don't want to say caliber. The quality of insight that a senior staff member has about the operation and a board member is quite different than what somebody has who loves their school deeply and loves their district deeply, but has a different lens on it. Right. Right. However, I would say that in the multitude of voices that come through, we learn a great deal that's really important about Portland Public Schools. The questions that we ask in the focus groups and in the surveys are they're basically the same in there. I'm going to distill them down. They're what's great. What's working really well in Portland Public? What are the challenges and complexities that the new superintendent is going to face? And what would you, meaning you non board person that we're engaging with at this moment, what would you be looking for in the superintendent if you were hiring them? And you're spot on that many people who don't work with the superintendent every day have a lens on what that job is, which may or may not actually reflect what their actual work is, but the general themes from large groups of people particularly important to what we hear from board members because you are the decision makers and we're very clear with everybody that we engage with that the ultimate decision resides with these seven. Michelle, that's a question. Thank you, Director.

start time: 280:20:10.000
end time: 295:35:49.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Yes, I had a comment that building on what Director Brim Edwards said and Julia and I think it's really important to let the community know why we're seeking their input and what impact it will have. And I know what I know from working in community engagement field in Portland is people want to be engaged. They also want to be told very clearly how their input will be used. And I think depending on the sample size, which will be big, we'll have lots of people that will fill the survey out. It gives us an opportunity to start to source themes. Even even though they don't understand the work of the superintendent. I still think, I think, as you mentioned, it would be good to hear from people about the strengths of the district and the challenges and important to hear from them. And then you start to theme those, those you start to, you start to see themes. And I think those themes will be really important for us in our selection process.

start time: 295:55:00.000
end time: 296:18:36.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Thank you. Thank you.

start time: 296:21:08.000

B: You.

B: Yeah. So to let me go through that slide and just sort of clarify where that criteria piece lands in the, in the process. So we've, we've engaged in focus groups, we've engaged in one on one support members. We've collected data from, from your surveys. We will present a first draft to you. This will be over two meetings because you'll see a first draft first. You'll review it in public session, you'll comment in it. Then there'll be a second meeting where public comment is invited and we'll adopt that next superintendent. You'll adopt, I should say the next superintendent criteria. And as Christy said, that's really kind of your marching orders to you giving us our marching orders for what we're looking for. That document does live throughout the search. It is in fact, as you said, Christy, what we build interview questions off of. We'll work to hold each other accountable because it's possible that a candidate comes in who's so charming that you fall in love with them and you forget the next superintendent criteria document because they're just so magnetic. Right. And so we want to bring ourselves back to this document as the guidepost of what we're looking for. I'm going to say we, it's you, I am your humble servant. But at the table, we'll look at this together. And you'll. You'll look for candidates through the lens of this. Once that criteria document is adopted by you, we. We begin the recruitment process in a typical search. Typical search that starts earlier in the year. Now I'm jumping ahead of myself. I'll get to that in the next slide. So recruitment happens once the position is live. It's posted. There's a place to go on our website that says apply to be the superintendent of schools. How do we find your great candidates? We talked a little bit about this when we did our pre meeting with you when you were interviewing multiple firms. We engage our network and our network of networks and you, everybody sitting at the table and online is our network. Now we'll be asking you when we meet with you who would. Is there somebody that you might get excited about if you saw them apply? We'll ask that in. We ask that in the survey. We ask that in the focus groups and folks give all sorts of names and some of them materialize to be actually viable contenders and some don't. And that's okay. That's the work of engaging networks. And we also have a broad network from outside of PPS that we use as well. That's that slide. So during that period of time, we're going to be kind of quiet. You're not going to see a lot of us. We're not going to have regular weekly meetings during the recruitment process. That's because our sleeves are rolled up and we're trying to find great candidates who want this, who want to engage in this remarkable opportunity here in Portland. I do want to talk about the board's role in the recruitment process, which is pretty much close to nothing.

B: It's pretty much close to nothing in the recruitment process. And here's why. We want to create a process that is absolutely fair to anybody out there who wants to come to Portland Public Schools. It's important that somebody who lives across the country who might meet the profile, who has always dreamed of living in Portland, has the same access to information that somebody who lives right here in Portland knows board members by first name. And so what we ask board members. I'm gonna ask for a nod that you. Not when somebody calls you and says, Christy Perry. No, when somebody calls you and says, when Christy Perry calls and says, can I have lunch with you? I'm really excited about Portland Public Schools. I really want to get your sense of it. When she calls you and says, can we do that, your answer is no, I'm so glad to know that you're interested, but here's Hank Harris team's email. Please reach out to them. That's our search firm. There will be people who will also lobby you. That's what I was going for. There will people who will say, you've got. Let me tell you why Christy Perry is the right candidate for Portland Public Schools. You should not engage in those phone calls with them. You should refer that person to us. We are here as your recruitment firm and that's what we do. We engage with candidates, we engage with prospects, we engage with. You'll see the term lobbyist in quotes. Folks who are really strongly advocating for a person and as they should. Right. If you know, if you're in the community and you know somebody and you think that person would be great, you should have a way to have your voice heard. But the proper way is, is to come to the search firm and there will be lobbyists. Anti lobbyists too. Right. There'll be the people who call you and say whatever you do, don't hire this person. And those folks should also be referred to the firm chair.

I mean it seems like it would be helpful to have on the website like send people straight to you because otherwise they'll look like I'm going to call, I'll call the board if I don't know where to call. So it seems like putting it up there and then letting all. It like giving all of us where you are.

end time: 406:22:36.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Sure. I think that's. That's a great question and easily doable. The. On our website, PPS already exists. It says not. It says information forthcoming and it says for further information, email. I forget which names are in there, but at least a couple of us. So if people go to our website, they'll already see PPS. It might make sense for PPS's website to have something sooner rather than later with that information. We can, we can, we can easily.

We'll also ask you in your one on ones if there's names of people that you're excited about.

end time: 497:06:02.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I guess again, recognizing that we're talking right now, we're largely talking about in general, what a search looks like. I want to point that this is. I want to share how we do searches that happen in the spring. And we're going to call this a spring search. In a typical search, if we were starting this in October, the recruitment process would begin after the adoption of a next superintendent criteria. That would be the logical sequence. Right? You've got the criteria. Now let's recruit. In this particular part of the year when you don't have quite as much time before July 1st as a search that starts in October, we're going to recommend that your recruitment window actually opens before you have your next superintendent criteria. So I see some nodding Right. So that there's a logic to that. But at the same time, a candidate has ought to know what that next superintendent criteria is before they finalize their application. So we'll want to kind of stagger that we'd like to open. Well, again, staying into the generic. We would recommend that we open the window, we then complete the next superintendent criteria, and then there's still some period of time where the window is still open where people can put in their applications or maybe withdraw their applications because they don't like what the criteria, whatever. But I see some nodding. So I think I'm. I think I'm making some sense. This is what happens in a typical human capital enterprises search firm when the window closes. Window closes, meaning we are no longer accepting applications. This is what happens in a typical search. Our team reviews all the applications in the purple. It says, let's imagine there's 25 applicants for Portland Public school superintendent. Our firm, using your next superintendent criteria, identifies, these are hypothetical numbers. We don't know what the actual numbers will be. Let's say our team says, you know what, there are 10, and we're going to review all the applications. There are 10 of these candidates that we think are most closely aligned to the next superintendent criteria. These impressive candidates are worthy of spending more time on. Our team will do an initial screening, which is a actual interview, where we'll do a virtual interview, and we'll transcribe that interview. And we'll also do a single telephone reference call, just one on the top candidates. And we only do one because it's early in the process. That candidate doesn't want, I mean, right. Doesn't want 15 people to be called early in the process. So we do a single reference call and initial screening interview. In a typical search, the board members, and only the board members have access to all that material. So they'll come a day when I'll say, board, I'm sending you out a link to all the application materials. You're going to see all 25. In a typical search, you're going to see all 25 applicants. You're going to see the 10 that we've moved sort of our top tier. You're going to see the transcripts of the interviews and the reference calls of those 10 candidates, and you're going to review them on your own time. And you're going to come to a meeting that we call the slate meeting. The slate meeting is an executive session meeting, only board members, no staff. And you'll have come reading the applications. Now, I Just want to go back up the slide. I can. In a typical search that has 25 applicants and 10 top candidates, some board members will say, I want to read all 25. I like this firm, but I still want to make sure they didn't miss somebody. And other board members will say, we hired this firm so that I don't have to do all this work. So I'm just going to read the 10 applicants. You can do whichever. In a typical firm search, I would say to the board, each of you can do whatever you want. You can read all of them, but at least read the ones that we've recommended to move forward. In all the years of doing searches, only one time did I have a board say, a board collectively say, you know what, we've read all the applications and there's one person that you didn't put in your top 10. And then we still want to interview them. And that is absolutely the right of the board. It's the board search. It's the board's candidates.

start time: 507:45:08.000
end time: 512:23:14.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I can look right now. And the thing is, because it's in the portal, like, we don't actually have their records and you can talk about, like candidate A in ways that doesn't disclose their name. I think the media can come. They can't report.

start time: 512:24:42.000

end time: 514:29:50.000

C: And you can just not. You just don't use their names. And it's because we don't have paper copies. Then there's no public record.

start time: 514:49:30.000
end time: 517:10:28.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And I would. Well, let's. Let's talk. We actually do use names in our executive sessions. Yeah, we do. We do. But it's always good to work through those legal issues.

start time: 517:11:24.000
end time: 524:20:14.000
confidence: 0.97
F: But I do. It is important because I want to make sure the rules of the executive session are important and hear what you're saying about the public records, I wonder if it's been challenged because often when we say, oh, consultant has the records, they're not public. But when it actually gets challenged to the da, the DA says no, it's public. So I don't know if that's been challenged in Oregon. I don't know if that's established case law or not. But I would just want to be, I would want us to be really thoughtful about that process because I think that's a really important step.

start time: 524:23:02.000
end time: 533:57:00.000
confidence: 0.96
D: The reasons on the ideal profile, you're collecting input. You're putting the ideal profile in the public and important. I would recommend you have a second meeting where you've taken public comment twice on it because that's how your public has access to giving you feedback about the search. And then that's. And you do the salary range in public before you, before you post. So that's the public part. And then I think, I believe that's the conduit to get that part into executive session.

F: So and then you sort of answered the question I had. But I mean it is interesting to forward all 25 applicants to the entire board because it feels like it could create a situation with a lot of second guessing by seven board members which, and I guess I just raised that as a practical concern. It sounds like you haven't had that experience.

start time: 544:08:22.000
end time: 551:36:18.000
confidence: 0.96
B: We haven't. And so we're going to later on this agenda, we're going to talk about what that might look like in a Portland environment. But I will say we have not had that concern. We've had it only once. And to me that's not a concern if one time there's, you know, I shouldn't say, you know, one time it's the board's, it's the board's decision. And typically, typically we hear board members say, I mean more than typically, like almost always board members will say, I read all 25 and you guys were absolutely right. Those are the 10 that I would have picked to move forward.

start time: 551:38:34.000
end time: 554:16:40.000
confidence: 0.89
F: But in and in your typical search though, you do forward 10 candidates and it looks like, you know, you're about to get to board that decides who to invite.

start time: 554:52:52.000
end time: 562:39:52.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Well, no, just what you've laid out is that of the 25, you narrowed down to 10. We come together in executive session. We say you did a great job. And then of that 10, the board then discusses. You say, you know, four to six to invite to sort of move forward. Is that. And that's different than processes I've been through for executive searches at other governments. So is that a school district specifically? It's a lot of. It's a lot of applications for the entire board to be going through rather than having a subcommittee.

start time: 562:42:16.000
end time: 565:17:12.000
confidence: 0.97
B: You mean 10 is a lot of applications. Right. I have not yet had a board member say that's too many applications, but every district's different. And so that might, that might feel.

start time: 565:18:56.000
end time: 566:14:20.000

confidence: 0.94
F: I mean, I'll just say, like, when, you know, Metro hired a chief executive officer four years ago, he didn't. The whole board did not get together to review 10 candidates. Like, it was, it was. There were subcommittees, it was narrowed down to two or three finalists. There were discussions along the way, keeping board members, you know, apprised. But I'm just. It's. It's a pretty heavy involvement by the board pretty early in the process.

start time: 573:22:38.000
end time: 597:56:40.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Sorry, go ahead. I would say that in the one, the second phase of the 2017 search, like 12 candidates, like, we brought a lot of candidates out and that was partly a function also is like, we knew the pool, not just because they met us, was going to get smaller. And so trying to keep the philosophy of like, keeping a competitive pool all the way to the end because people, for a variety of reasons will drop out. So we. And there were people who on paper, like, man, this person was like the superintendent, national superintendent of the year. And then it's like we met them and it's like, oh. But it did give the board, I think by the end, it gave them a really good sense of just the comparative. So we weren't just looking at three models. Like, we'd seen 12. And it's like, we definitely. That's not our type. And like, yes, those three candidates had these things we really liked. Let's try and keep them cool. But it actually was. I found it was a good Monday experience and we needed to keep the pool large because even at the very end, the pool got smaller without us making it smaller. I mean, like, they, we. We select people out. Like, we exit people out and, you know, they exit themselves out. And sometimes it's like, maybe you shouldn't exit them out because the pool is getting pretty small. So hold them Just in case to refresh the pool.

end time: 609:09:34.000
confidence: 0.97
D: One thing to think about too is that whoever you hire is going to work for, even though you're a collective board of seven and they're working for the board, they also have a relationship with that seven individual people who are their bosses. And if I were wanting to be hired, I would want to be fully hired by the full board too. And part of that, going through the whole process together helps you really come to strengthen strong agreement about who you collectively hire. So I think the process is good. And I don't know if it was different with Metro in that it's a bigger board. You know, I'm on same side. Yeah. I'm on a couple other boards that I would say, oh, yeah, you don't.

B: So let's. I think I just got a few more slides on overall and then get to. What you're all excited to talk about was, okay, well, what's it going to look like here? Right? Did I. Okay. So at the end. So this slate meeting happens at the end. A typical number that you would invite for what we call first round interviews. A typical number of candidates you'd invite is between four and six out of your 25 the round. So we end that slate meeting, we end that engagement session with. Let's. I'm just going to pick the number between five candidates that are going to be invited for first round interviews. We will do all the coordinating, the logistics, the setting it up. We highly recommend. Those are virtual. We can talk about why, but we think that it just makes a lot of sense from a financial and from just an efficiency standpoint. We'll build the interview questions based on your next superintendent criteria, but we will also invite you directors to offer input or say, you know, what's your favorite question that you love to ask in hiring process? So it's collaborative, but we'll own the document. That is the interview questions. We typically do it in one long day and in small print. I wrote breakfast through evening. That's typically how we do it. We get together on breakfast and by evening you've finished your interviews and you're selecting. Let's say you've had five interviews you're selecting your finalists and typically that number of finalists is between two and four. Three is the most common number. So let's, let's just. In this imaginary search, you interviewed five people in round one and three of them move forward to the next round at the end of the day and those are your finalists. There's a lot of prep work that goes into the finalist round by your consultant firm. So we shoulder the great majority of it. We will, earlier in the process, we will have facilitated a conversation with you board or with a group of board members about what are the various events that happen in round two. And the key question that's going to govern what those events are is that third bullet point, which I know you've talked about at your board and I know that we'll talk about together. Maybe not maybe tonight a little bit, but more in our next planning meeting, which is about. About the public release of finalist names or the not releasing names publicly. As this is a PowerPoint about how we typically do it. I will say that we typically do not release names of finalists. As a firm, we think that's the best practice and we encourage boards to not do that. And we'll tell you why. And at the end of the day, it's the board's decision and we'll support whatever decision you make. But in the current era, we do recommend, and we recommend strongly that the names and finalists are not released until you only have one and that person is signing a contract. I know you have strong feelings about that.

B: So the events of round two can include a variety of things and of course, depending whether it's public or not, sort of makes it different. Right. In a public search, you can take candidates on a walk through the school. You wouldn't do that. Where the names are not being released publicly. Our events often include or typically include a community stakeholder panel or community constituent panel, which is just what it sounds like. And community members would typically sign confidentiality affidavits. A reverse interview with the sitting superintendent is sometimes useful, particularly if the superintendent's been there for a while. A reverse interview is where the candidate interviews the superintendent, not the superintendent interviewing the candidate. It's an opportunity for the candidate to deeply learn the work. The superintendent, the sitting superintendent, is certainly not part of the decision making process, but is a resource to candidates. We often have them have coffee with the executive assistant and we certainly will engage in A final interview with the board. And usually that's a lengthy one. Two to two and a half hours in length.

D: Sometimes. That community constituent group could also be senior staff. One panel might be. You might say, we want senior staff to do one interview and give us set of interviews.

end time: 686:04:16.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Or even. Or even a combination. You're right. We call it a community panel, but it. It doesn't mean specifically only community members. It includes internal students. And students are on that as well. Yeah. Thank you, Christy.

D: The student experiences can be really powerful as you think through how you want to engage your board, your student who's the advisor to the board, and panels of kids that have great insight.

F: Go into this, but what do you do with that stakeholder panel feedback? How do you structure it?

start time: 691:34:10.000
end time: 714:15:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: We structure it. Let's see if the next slide speaks to that. No. Okay. So what that looks like is a group of typically 12 members of the community staff, students, parents, family members. They come in and they engage in an interview. We facilitate that interview. The interview is based on the next superintendent criteria. We collect two kinds of feedback from those. The first is they engage in a group debrief. So we ask some potent questions. They engage with each other, and we are taking notes as they're engaging with each other. And that's the group debrief, which board will see. And then after that group debrief, we ask each community member to complete a survey, an individual online survey, monkey survey on what their impressions are. And so then your board will also see those. So you'll get 12 individual survey responses. And there'll be some parallels. Right. Between the group debrief and the individual. And there'll be some differences because not everybody's going to say everything aloud that they want to say individually. And as the body of work, as we move into this final interview that you'll have as a board, in a typical search, you're going to start to have a lot of data at your hands. You're going to have. I just described a whole lot of data. 1212 survey responses, group debriefs per candidate. So you start to build up like a level of data and input around these candidates that you'll use in your final interview.

I: Yeah, I have a question. So we've got community stakeholder panels, but we're not releasing the name of the applicant.

start time: 717:57:34.000
end time: 724:32:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So that is correct. So, yes, Patti, and thank you for raising that. So the members of that panel sign confidentiality affidavits. So they are. And in every email, usually I drive them crazy because by the time I meet with them, I probably sent them six emails telling them how confidential this is and why it's confidential. So you're right on both accounts. Yeah. Okay, great.

start time: 724:44:20.000
end time: 726:36:44.000
confidence: 0.98
F: My experience with those stakeholder panels for hiring is just to be very careful that we don't ask them to rank the candidates.

start time: 726:38:52.000
end time: 727:14:04.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Absolutely. We never do that. Yeah.

B: But they'll want to.

start time: 728:01:08.000
end time: 732:00:14.000
confidence: 0.88
F: To remind them that that's because you set up a dynamic, you know this. With the rest of the board. You can set up a dynamic where that stakeholder panel might say, oh, we have our first, second, third candidate and the board goes to the third candidate and everyone gets back. So really structured as feedback, input, impressions.

F: And reminding that.

start time: 733:02:30.000
end time: 764:25:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Absolutely right. Yeah. Yep. Well said. The other pieces that are happening around this time is that there is a full background check being completed by a third party entity. We are doing reference. We forward. Let me say that differently. We will. We facilitate a series of reference calls on each candidate. And it's very different than that first one. That first one way back at the beginning of the process is if Christy applies. When she applies, I ask Christy, who's somebody that I could call right now that's going to speak to your work, and Christy picks that person. Okay, that's great on a certain level. Right. But that's also not great. Right. It's something, but it's not everything. So at this point in the process, we do something different. We go to Christy and we say, Christy, you're a finalist. I've looked at your org chart of your current district and I've looked at the org chart of the district you were at before, and Here are the 10 people that I'm going to make phone calls to. And Christy's going to go, okay. And I'm going to say, so you have a day to reach out to those people and you can tell them to please be confidential. But we want to talk to all of them. Some of those people are going to. Absolutely. Most of those people are going to love Christy, because who doesn't love Christy? But there might be one or two people that weren't her biggest fans. Right. And we want to talk to them. Them too. We're not looking to only. I mean, I. I don't know that there's any people in the world, but we. That we're owning that. Right. We're saying these are the people we want to talk to. And board members are deeply involved in that reference calling process. So we see the board that. We see that as a board member responsibility. And you ask. We'd ask you each to please sign up. Sometimes board members. Some board members want to opt out, but in general, most board members do at least. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I can't force it. I can't force it, but.

confidence: 0.95
B: I love it. I love it. So the reference calls and then. Yeah, okay. So that's what the last two bullet points are about. The reference call piece. So back to what we were talking about. The amount of input and data that you now have on your finalists, it's a growing amount. Right? You've got the community members, you've got the reference calls, you've got the investigative background check, which hopefully comes out seamless. Okay, so this is what I was actually just saying. You have. Sorry, you have a lot of data. You go to your second interview. I'm going to move this agenda forward a little bit. You engage with the candidates for two to two and a half hours. That final interview, by the way, is the only interview in a typical search which is unscripted. In other words, you're not walking in with a set of interview questions that we've created. You are asking questions specific to each candidate based on the body of work that you have. So there are specific questions that you're going to ask each finalist that have been raised either by you in earlier interviews or by community members. So that's. That's a pretty. It's a pretty boisterous, engaged interview. And we're going to encourage you to grill that candidate because that candidate might be your next superintendent. Don't go too soft on them.

B: When we finish that process, that second interview, we come together in executive session, and we. We work hard to coalesce around a single candidate. Most of the time that happens. Sometimes we need more time and we need more resources. But typically in a typical search, we come together and it's still an executive session, and there is a coalescence around a single candidate at that point. Usually two members of the board are the negotiations committee. I don't mean labor negotiations. I mean contract negotiations with the candidate. And once those negotiations are completed, the board will schedule a special board meeting where the candidate's name is announced to the public as. And it's open. I mean, you have to, of course, have vote in open session to hire your new superintendent. So that's. And communications piece plays. All right, so you can read that. And I think that is. So that is a typical search. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, thank you for. Thank you for being great, active listeners. Okay. I know you have a lot of thoughts about what we do about this, and I'm actually going to ask Christy to talk about the very first piece of work, which is engagement. So keep holding those thoughts. But we do want to be jumping into engagement even before we finish the design of the search. So, Christy, take it away.

start time: 825:14:02.000
end time: 889:10:22.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Okay. And you can go on next slide then. Yeah, we want to talk about engagement because really, in our mind, we're feeling already a little bit behind for engagement because we know the intensity of what you've contracted with us for, and we want to get going. And if our goal would be that the engagement, we could have it fully completed and a draft profile lead by spring break. So that's pretty aggressive, which is why we're jumping right in. So the things I'll want to start to get scheduled is one on one board meetings with board members. And then I've already gotten our search firms scheduled. So I already have blocks of time that we have blocked out in March for the actual 40 online focus group sessions. We're not picking who those focus group sessions are with. We have some ideas other than the board for sure. All of you, some senior staff, for sure. But you're going to need to help us, whoever it's either collectively as a board or a small group of the board is going to help us design what's the engagement going to be and with who. One of the things we'll ask. Let me finish the third bullet first. The last thing you've contracted with us for is two on site Focus group events. We would think about those events and want you to think about those events as people who typically wouldn't answer a survey or a group of people that we is critically important that you hear from them and you want us to go to them. So Hector is skilled at doing spanish. Full day on site sessions. We're thinking at least one potentially in spanish, but again, that'll be up to you. And Hector's already said he's available the first weekend, the first full week of march. So like around the 7th or 8th of March that we could do an on site, those on site focus sessions. But again, we want to be really strategic. It might also be a time that you say, hey, one of those we want at a high school with kids or we want it out at this community center. This group of people is specifically important. So that's what we're going to ask you to help us with. And your district staff as well. You have people in the district that also are going to know who should probably be on the list. So one thing I'm a couple things I'm going to ask for you tonight is one is if you have a specific person that needs to be invited to a focus group or a group of people that needs to be invited to a focus group in your mind, we just want you to send those to roseanne. And we're thinking by like Monday morning, if you could have those sent to and it doesn't just think of more along the way, we stop some planning time. So if you will do that, then the second question, and I think this will come when you're talking about a work group. The next question is then who am I going to work with to design your engagement? The goal would be that next Tuesday either late afternoon, evening, but we've tentatively put that aside as a time that I could either come to you or we could do a virtual event. And I think that Steve was going to join me and we'll design the focus groups and then I'm going to ask roseanne to be included in that as well, because then she becomes the conduit for getting invites out and scheduling. You don't have to do any of that part. You just have to help me design the who. So that's how we're thinking.

start time: 889:11:26.000
end time: 892:30:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Throw one thing in there. And Roseanne, you might think about there is a large body of work in terms of inviting people. You might want to bring somebody else in also, maybe from comms or whoever you're thinking might need to be two staff.

start time: 892:50:30.000
end time: 917:17:00.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Yeah, we did that last year in Salem Tides, where it's both a board manager plus somebody out of the comms department to help with that. And then they would help facilitate some of the access to technology on the virtual sessions. One hiccup that we ran across in Salem Kaiser was we had people that we wanted to do a virtual session with that didn't have access to technology. So we brought them in and gave them technology to do other virtual sessions so that they could still have access. So there's some ways that we can really work on the accessibility and that we tried out last year in Salem Kaiser. So for everyone, it's if you have a specific group, specific person names to Roseanne by Monday, Steve and I and Tammy are thinking next week we'd like to begin those one on ones with board members as well. We think you're the first and really important group to launch with the engagement. So I'm going to also give Roseanne a schedule that works for us. And it'll be more times than just seven times for then you to work around to say, hey, I can be in the interview with you on this time. So I'll give her a bunch of times next week and the early on in the following week for you to sign up. But I'll let her coordinate that. And we'll also do those virtually unless you're buying lunch. And then I'll come to you or wait, I'll come to you.

But it seems to me that maybe it's not only that topic but also a little bit of how does the PPS design look, because looking around the room, I can tell that folks are anxious to talk about several aspects of the things we just described. So Steve and Tammy, take it away.

J: Thanks, Hank. Good evening, Portland Public Schools Board of Directors. We're delighted to join you. Tammy and I have been asked to speak a bit about the process and at what point boards typically engage either as a committee of the whole or through a board work group. At some point, we'll need direction from the board on how you'd like to partner and in what form. So let me just summarize what Hank and Christy has have already shared relative to our typical search process. Where possible, we strongly recommend that boards do almost all of their search work together. Planning, meeting, finalizing, and acting on the next superintendent criteria, all facets of the selection and interview phase. All of that we strongly recommend is done as a committee of a whole. There are certainly a few exceptions when we advise that a board work group be formed to assist, particularly around some of the planning details. As Christy identified the scope of focus group engagements, our proposal has 40 focus groups built in. Three community interview panels will need direction from the board on a composition of the community interview panels. And then, as Hank indicated, we'll need direction on round 2 events and activities for finalists. In most instances, this process, when done together by the board, can strengthen the board team. You can set the stage for a successful superintendent transition, which is why, in part, we strongly recommend most of the work being done as a committee of the whole. And I asked Tammy to just talk a little bit about some of the rationale behind that, just in terms of vetting and learning and strengthening understanding together as a collective body.

J: Thanks, Tammy. We are looking for direction and certainly would turn this over to Chair Hollins to help facilitate a conversation around the board's interest relative to doing the work as a committee of the whole and where work groups might be formed to help inform the search process. Chair Hollins.

confidence: 0.95
A: Thank you. Yeah, so I'm, I kind of dive in around that. I understand the piece of doing the whole board piece, understand the cohesive. Cohesiveness of having the whole board do stuff. I, I pushed back, said I think this board is a strong board. The process that we had used by bifurcating groups and trusting our board members to do some. It's literally the same process that we did when we picked you guys. Right. And so I don't necessarily think that, you know, it, it's a negative for this board. I don't know about other boards, but for this board to trust their board members to be able to make certain decisions in the best of the board. We did the same thing during the strike thing that we did as well, and we were able to stand together, become strong. So I don't know necessarily if that's the outcome that we need as we. I feel that we are a strong board and we are a trusting board. I trust any one of my colleagues to make a decision on the best path forward for our board. And if there's any other, you know, questions around that anyone can speak up and say, you know what, I don't trust them, folks, and that's okay, but this works.

A: So that's kind of my thinking, my thought process. Chair Hollins Some of the things that I proposed earlier wasn't a division of the board. It was just the allocation of duties for, for board members as a whole. And that's kind of what that, that process was. Go ahead. Patti.

I: Yeah, Gary. I just wondered, are you doing that to save, save us time? For me, I would just like to see it all. I mean, I just, I'm interested and I don't. And it looks like we've hired this group to do the hard work for us. And then I personally would just like to have a chance to see it all. And it doesn't look like it's. Well, maybe you could tell us how long do you think it does take for us to read, say we just want to read the top 10. How much time would that be for us. Anybody on the team.

J: Boards can spend hours. Some individual board can process reviewing files within an hour. It really depends on how deeply an individual board director wants to dive into the application. I do want to provide just one clarifying comment. The message here, I want to be clear, is not about trust. It's about building a shared understanding and knowledge, listening to board directors engage in productive struggle, engage in discourse about the strengths and the weaknesses of candidates. There is an emerging shared consensus through that deliberation and discourse. So I just want to clarify that this isn't about communicating a level of trust or distrust. This is just about building collective wisdom with everyone in the room, strengthening the evaluation process, and bringing a level of rigor to the approach before you make one of the most important decisions that you will be making this year, which is hiring your next superintendent of schools.

start time: 1076:11:40.000
end time: 1083:29:56.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Gotcha. And like. And I think for me, it's not necessarily not having that the whole. The whole process be. Be bifurcated with certain board members. I'm thinking just certain parts of it. So, like what Director Scott was talking about. Well, if we're going to give us the whole list of 25. Yeah, I'm sure some people are going to read the whole list of 25. But when we get to that 10 piece, and I'm not looking at Julia. Yeah, he's going to read the whole.

start time: 1083:30:28.000

start time: 1084:47:50.000
end time: 1093:33:26.000
confidence: 0.96
A: What I'm saying is, as we move from that 10 to that 6, at that 10 level, and I'm just using as an example, at that 10 level, I think that work can be broken up and shared amongst individual. I mean, in groups of board members to select that next group, that's going to be that six. And then at that sixth level, I think, yeah, we all should come together and talk about that when we get to that six level, to make it to that final two or three level and ultimately the next superintendent. But that's kind of where I was coming out from there.

start time: 1093:35:58.000
end time: 1094:49:58.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So, yeah, I. A couple different thoughts. I think the different parts of the process are important.

B: Right.

start time: 1094:55:10.000
end time: 1098:22:46.000
confidence: 0.94
F: When we're doing what I think this beginning part about getting our superintendent criteria. What do you call it? The next superintendent criteria. We all have to agree on that. The most important part of this process.

start time: 1098:23:58.000
end time: 1098:33:58.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Right. And.

start time: 1098:34:54.000
end time: 1098:53:42.000
confidence: 0.99
F: And we need to hash that out.

start time: 1098:54:06.000
end time: 1098:56:22.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Right.

start time: 1098:56:46.000
end time: 1108:58:26.000
confidence: 0.96
F: If there's disagreement about. I want to focus on this. I want to focus on that. Like, we've got to have agreement on that. And we can only do that as an entire board. I will just say bluntly in my experience, the process you laid out is very micromanaging by all seven board members. I mean, I will tell you, when I hire, I don't sit on the first two panels, right. And I'm the hiring manager. I wait. I have hiring panels. I get diverse folks in there to come in and, you know, stakeholders and people at the level and higher and below, and then they recommend the me3 candidates. I interview the final three candidates, and I've never thought about, you know, oh, man, what if there was someone in that top 15 that they missed.

start time: 1108:58:58.000
end time: 1109:00:34.000
confidence: 0.81
B: Right.

start time: 1109:00:42.000
end time: 1115:17:18.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Because I trust them. I trust, you know, the folks I'm putting on those panels to do that job. I, you know, I hear what you're saying, Steve, about how this can bring a board together. It could. I could also see how it could divide a board, right? So if we're looking at 10 candidates and someone says, these two are my favorite, they're absolutely my favorite. And the majority of the board says, I don't like those two at all.

start time: 1115:18:14.000
end time: 1115:36:50.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Oh, yeah, I'm not talking.

start time: 1116:06:30.000
end time: 1131:33:30.000
confidence: 0.95
F: We're not moving those people forward. I could imagine that board member who felt like they were the strongest candidate is going to go into those finalist interviews with the four or five that we have and is going to think, well, my favorite's back there. So I don't, I don't like number one. I don't like number two. Number three, number four. You know, there could be division there as well. And just to be blunt, if you hadn't spent a lot of time investing in those top candidates and you're just looking at the top four or five, those are the ones you're focused on. So I think that dynamic may work. The way you've laid it out, I could see it working a different way as well. Obviously, this is the whole board decision. I will just tell you. And if the whole board wants to review all 25, I won't be. I will review 10 if you send them to me. And I would narrow it down to three or four. I don't think we need to narrow it down to six because you can always go back, right. If three or four don't work, you can always go back, you know, to the well again. But, you know, if that's what the board wants to do, that's when they're. I would also be very comfortable with a subcommittee narrowing it down. I would be very comfortable with you narrowing anybody but me narrow.

end time: 1136:54:20.000
confidence: 0.95
F: If we've done our job, our job is upfront setting that criteria. Applying the criteria to be done by a lot of people. And then the intangibles are what happen at the very end. But I'm not sure we want to be dealing with those intangibles we're talking about. So 6, 7, 8, 10 candidates. Right? Then you're still talking about are they meeting the majority of that criteria.

confidence: 0.95
C: So I. I feel very strongly that the full board should. And people don't have to read the whole 25, but I think that they. Everybody should get the 10 the group is recommending. And if they want to look at the 25s, that's up to them. The reason I say that, so having gone through it twice, it does, I think actually. Actually also gone to university president searches. The same thing is like, actually, if you don't include people, I think it complicates people at the end. It complicates things at the end because what if you have somebody insisting, I want to see these two, Then you can have a conversation about, like, what is it that. About those two that you are really wanted to see? And what I find with this group is people listen to each other and it's like, either somebody realizes, like, yeah, I'm not that invested in those two, or other people, like, I see why you want to have that individual in there. I also think it, and I know this from talking to superintendents and presidents who've hired. It's really helpful to them because otherwise, really, you're just meeting somebody, potentially half. Half your board.

C: Well, I know what I'm saying. But the finalists. So I hired a university president that I met once. It was like, I don't know about this person. And like, it was a good gut feeling about it. Because the way it was set up is like, there was. We only got to meet the finalists. And to me, the value, it's not, hey, I don't trust somebody else is like, it's more. I value other people's point of view because, like, what if I get, like, really settled on this is the person and it's like, oh, But I heard something from Gary, pointed out, like, I.

start time: 1172:56:06.000
end time: 1191:33:42.000
confidence: 0.95
C: And to me, that's the bigger value of the discussion among the board about what is it you saw on that person that you think is going to be a great leader and why did you not even have that on your list? And I do think through the process, if we do things as a group, usually it's a process. It's amazing how at the end, the group. Actually, there's very little division, I mean, because we're talking through what our values are, the match. We thought about candidates, and I think we're influencing each other, and that's a great thing versus, I think, very helpful versus one person not being part of it. And, like, I'm not super invested in this candidate because I haven't spent very much time with them. I'm not sure, you know, the thing that wasn't sure about never got answered. So I. I feel very strongly that we all. All should do it. And I would. I would hope that we don't want to.

H: Hi there. I just. Sorry, I left for a minute, and I'm. I'm back. I think, Director Edwards, you were talking about the importance of the full board being involved, and I wanted to state that I agree with that. I think this is one of the most important aspects of the work that we do, really, that we're really supposed to do is very discreet. And this is one of the ones that's very important. And I hope I'm on topic, but that's what I would like to advocate for, is that the entire board be as engaged as possible, not. Not necessarily subgroups.

I: Yeah. And when. When Julia mentioned. It really has nothing to do with trust for me, anyway. It has to do with getting all the information. And it also has to do with, as Julia said, hearing what other people have to say. Because I respect everybody on this board for different things. Everybody really has a different take on things, different knowledge, different background, different way of looking at things. And I want to hear all that, not just, you know, I've looked at three, and I think, well, this is the best. And somebody else say, Eddie says, well, I think this one's the best, and I trust Eddie. So. So then I look kind of at those two, but I haven't really read all of them myself and really talked about them. And I just think it's really important because we all bring something different, and I think we should just all look at everything. Plus, this group has been doing this for years and is suggesting this is the best way. So somehow I think we should take that knowledge that we're paying for and use it.

F: It's worth clarifying. Nobody's suggesting the whole board shouldn't be involved in the hiring decision. Like the whole board's involved in the hiring. The only question is where the whole board comes in. Hank and the firm are suggesting we come in at 10. I'm suggesting we could come in at 4 or 5. We could also come in at 25. I mean, the same principle applies, right? So all these arguments about getting the whole board. We could get together and review 25 candidate, you know, interviews. Or maybe you get 50 candidates. We could come together at 50. All I'm saying. And it's not just a matter of saving time. It's just also a matter of, you know, we're paying a lot for a search firm to do this work. I mean, we could, as a board, do all of that as well. I think that's less efficient. I think it's. I actually trust the firm to do a better job than we will of applying the criteria we've done to the candidates. And then the whole board is. Is. Is absolutely involved in a hiring decision. So it's just. It's. It's really the only question here, I think, that we're talking about is, you know, are we sitting around for. For four hours talking about 10 candidates? Are we sitting around for two hours talking about five candidates?

But I kind of want to say I see both your points. I think I want to also hear what Steve has to say. But, you know, for a lot of us, this is our first time searching for a superintendent, so I think maybe it might be important just to have built in flexibility for, you know, for cases that people do want to participate more or not. But I also value a lot of us as a Board coming together and sharing the reasons why we have different.

J: Yeah, I just wanted to add a point of clarity to Director Scott's comments. Typically, we do not spend four hours in this late meeting. And candidly, the firm will bring to you tiered recommendations of that slate. We'll bring a tier one, tier two, and tier three. We'll take the 10. And we'll just sort of segment this in a way that helps. Given our review of the applicant files, given our preliminary interviews, given the reference call, given the ideal profile and some rigorous application of those criterion against all of that data input, we'll come to you with some recommendations. But often it's the deliberative process and different points of view that allows the board to say, human capital enterprises, we want to advance these four to six. Typically that happens within a two hour or less conversation.

A: Great, great. All right, so we got. We got past that. So the next thing that was a concern of mine is the transparency piece. And I'm just. I'm just say what I need to say. When we wait until the final candidate and then we present that to the whole public, it seems like we're working inside us work behind closed doors or working and keeping our community in the dark. And for this community at this time, I think transparency and openness is actually what we need to have with this process. And I know you guys have a different way of doing things, and I think I understand that. And so we can just have that type of conversation. I'm not saying that the. And I was gonna just give a whole bunch of statistics and stuff from folks that I know at Harvard and all that stuff, but I'm not going to go through all that. I'm just talking about what we need here that I see we need here for Portland, Oregon. I understand it has to be a level of confidentiality at certain point, and I'm all for that. I feel once we get down to that four to six round one piece, I think at that point we need to be open and as transparent as possible. And I want to know how we would do that and what you guys thought about that as well.

When we get down to like those last, those last few, I think we broadcast to the world tell everybody you shouldn't even got in this race if you didn't want get down to that point and then be like, well, I'm still, I don't want my other job to know or I don't want you here. I, I need somebody that's let ready to let the world know that I'm going to go to Portland and I'm going to transform everything. I can't wait to get there. This is about to be the best move that I ever made. This is where I want. I, I love the rain. We need that person that loves the rain like you said, like that'll turn people away. I want that person that is excited about the rain. So when we get down to it, I want to be able to let the whole community know this is where we're at. These are the ones that we're going for because everybody's going to have some buy in. I want them to be a part of the process. I want them to see what we're doing. I want them to be going online like it's March Madness looking at the interviews and checking it out. I don't know if they can, but March Madness is coming up and so it's on my mind.

A: And I know, and I know this, and I know this and I know there is a lot of concern when they talk about, you know, some highly qualified candidates may be reluctant to apply because if it's, if it's with a school district, with this, that is more transparent process and I know a lot of times it's concerned about privacy, confidentiality and things like that. But I think, you know, a search process can actually enhance the pull of candidate by attracting individuals who are committed to transparency. Accountability for Oregon. You know, we, we talking about accountability, we're talking about transparency and we've been talking about it. We said it a bunch of times yesterday at the meeting. But then we go into a process that's not, is almost counterproductive to what we've been saying this whole time about accountability and transparency. I think we attract, I think we can attract candidates because they have those same values. I think we attract those candidates because they have that same purpose of accountability and transparency piece. And I think it also will signal to candidates that school districts have values, openness, fairness, accountability. And we want people who share those values and who's willing to participate in that. And then I'll leave it at that for now. I think Michelle has the hand up.

confidence: 0.95
H: Yes. Sorry. I, I kind of feel both ways about the transparency piece because we do want to attract someone that's like going to lay it all on the table at the same time. If you have a job and you're working in a community, I mean, imagine like for Portland, we, I think the candidates sense of wanting to be private until at least maybe they're a finalist is a big deal. We, you know, when you start looking around and getting interviews, even if they're just informational, you signal to your home district that you're kind of looking around. And that might be, that might be a chilling effect for somebody that's really good, that kind of wants to just put their toe in the waters, you know, and see what's out there without notifying, you know, the rest of the nation and their district specifically that they're out looking.

F: I missed that clarifying question before you. You maybe get this. At what point did you recommend. Was it only the, the finalist? So was it only when the board has chosen the candidate that the name gets public? Or is it.

start time: 1376:15:02.000
end time: 1380:48:34.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah. Let me, if I may, and I want to be clear. Like, I mean, I put it out there. We do recommend what I'm about to share, and I hear great passion from your board chair and vice chair. And so we'll go either way. But I would like to take a moment, if I can, to just outline why we feel the way we do.

start time: 1380:50:02.000
end time: 1381:09:38.000

end time: 1391:56:02.000
confidence: 0.96
B: We should be passionate. Yeah, for sure. And I would say this is a decision I would love to not make tonight and make at your next meeting, if that's okay, because this might be a richer conversation. I promise to get you out in the next half hour, but as you will. But let me just share some thoughts. And again, my vested interest is a search that is going to work for you and is going to bring you a successful superintendent, a successful pool, a great pool, and a successful superintendent. Here are some things that you may or may not have thought about. And what do you know? I actually have a slide to go. Okay. So the first one, I just want to say.

start time: 1391:57:46.000
end time: 1392:14:10.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Never would have guessed that.

start time: 1392:14:50.000
end time: 1407:24:36.000
confidence: 0.98
B: You can argue, you can argue, you can just. I will just say our experience is very strong, that your pool will be impacted and just weigh that. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it this way, but do know that there are candidates that simply will not apply. To answer your question, Director Scott, there are candidates who will not apply. There are some candidates and some very talented candidates who will not go into a search where their name will be floated before a decision is made. In other words, they will only be in a search if their name becomes public. If they're the successful one, they don't want their name to be. Portland Public school has these three finalists because for the very reasons Director DePass said, then they have to go back to their district if they didn't get the job and explain why they don't want to be there. And again, I don't mean to argue the weight of whether that's the kind of person you want or not. I'm just saying there will be people that won't apply for this job if that's a decision.

start time: 1407:27:08.000
end time: 1411:52:00.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Have a quick question. So if that kind of person we're looking at hiring don't want to do that for their district, is that possibly that same superintendent would do that to us and won't let it, Won't let the public and everybody know or us know that they're applying for another job until they have one already lined up.

start time: 1412:10:20.000
end time: 1412:53:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Because that's the character of that person. So the answer to that, I don't.

start time: 1412:53:40.000
end time: 1413:20:00.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Think it's a characteristic for you.

start time: 1413:38:20.000
end time: 1415:09:02.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Can you answer the question? I just want to know, would we. Could we potentially have that same thing done to us as well?

start time: 1415:10:46.000
end time: 1416:50:50.000
confidence: 0.99
B: I think whoever you hire might very well be a person that doesn't want to go public when they are applying for a new job.

start time: 1416:55:50.000
end time: 1420:44:30.000
confidence: 0.89
D: Yeah, but you'll have already contacted their district in reference checking, so while it's not public and splashed out there, you will, you will. They'll. Their district will have to.

start time: 1420:45:10.000
end time: 1436:24:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: That's. I, I thank you for saying that. And I think that. I think maybe. Maybe what? Thank you. Because I didn't hear that piece, but maybe there's a piece which I would fully understand. You don't want to be caught, blindsided by your superintendent who says, hey, chair, I just took another job at another district like that. That feels horrible to you. I would say that the great, great, great. I think I want to say all of them, but I can't go through my Rolodex right now. Have shared with their board chair and their board leadership prior to the public announcement that they're going somewhere else. So that a board chair. I would say that is a character issue. If you don't tell your board chair and your vice chair that you've taken a new job and they read about it in the Oregonian the next day, that's a character issue. But in the searches that we do, even though it's confidential, we're expecting that person to share with their leadership privately. Hey, just want to let you know I am going to be named or I'm a finalist for another search. Anyway, let me just hit some points about why this might not be something you want to do. And again, whatever the board decides, we will support.

start time: 1436:37:50.000
end time: 1437:31:02.000

end time: 1440:41:26.000

start time: 1443:16:32.000
end time: 1447:49:04.000
confidence: 0.96
B: No, you don't. Go ahead. I think there are many members of communities who expect to know who the finalists are. I think they're. Because we live in an era where in many searches it is. So you will have people saying, wait a minute, how come Portland isn't announcing their superintendents? So you will have that. You will have that expectation.

start time: 1447:49:52.000
end time: 1451:48:58.000
confidence: 0.93
A: And then what? And then, I'm sorry, what do you do about leaks? So if we go through that process, then leaks come out. Then now we have to deal with a whole nother transparency and trust issue from the community because leaks has been out there and we haven't been transparent. But. I'm sorry, go ahead.

start time: 1451:49:54.000
end time: 1454:01:50.000
confidence: 0.89
G: I was going to say, I mean, bullet point number two is kind of one of my concerns. I'm curious what you're going to say about that. I mean, I can also see it backfire.

start time: 1454:08:50.000
end time: 1493:41:22.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So. So let's talk about number two. So in a public. Let's. Let's move forward and assume that you are announcing, let's say, finalists. I would really discourage you at the semifinalist at the six level for the reasons director Mapass said. Let's say that you've agreed that at the finalist level, your three finalists are announced publicly. You will get, as the vice chair said. I forget the words you used. You want March Madness, right? Everybody's going to be out looking. Everyone's going to be googling. Everyone's going. And they are going to be making their. They're going to be opining on your finalists based on some degree of knowledge, which sometimes is going to be relatively thin. For instance, you might have three interviews that are live streamed, and I might watch just one of them. Right. I'M Joe Public. I watch one with them and I'm like, that's the person. I'm going to make sure I fill out my comment card that says that's the person. The great majority of people who will weigh in in a public sort of way will have a very thin amount of information to go by. Sure, we'll give them the next superintendent criteria. They may use it, they may not use it, but they will make their decisions based on far less information than the body of knowledge that you're going to have or that a community panel is going to have. So I would say that what are you hearing from the public may or may not actually reflect when you look at the sort of the magnitude of the data. And you'll get lots and lots of data. Right. Hundreds and maybe thousands of people in Portland will let you know what they think. But what do you do with that data? Now that data is going to come. One of two things is going to happen. They're going to be a large amount of data that says Kristen's the right person. And then you're in a tough spot because your public has said she's charming, she's magnetic, she's wonderful, she's who we need. You can still pick somebody else at the end of the day, but that's going to make it a lot tougher for you as a board to go against the public that has fallen in love with this candidate. The other thing that can happen is, and this goes down to really number bullet point, number four is, let's say the other thing that happens and often happens, is you've got a whole bunch of public input and you've got like, they fall into different buckets, and it's not really clear where your public is. And so what do you do as a human being when you're faced, you've got these four finalists or three finalists. Who do you talk to? You talk to your spouse. You talk to your best friend. They're going to call you if you don't talk to them.

start time: 1493:41:46.000
end time: 1493:44:50.000
confidence: 0.82
A: Right.

start time: 1493:45:30.000
end time: 1518:16:16.000
confidence: 0.96
B: They're going to say, herman, I watched the interviews. It's gotta be so. And so. We end up getting input and taking input from the people that we trust most. Who are the people that look like us and who are the people that we spend time with. And to really elevate voices of people that are underheard means that we're not making our decisions based upon what our spouse and best friend and closest group of people tell us, but. But with a large amount of input of hundreds of Thousands of voices. You're a human being. Of course you're going to listen. You're going to at least attend to those people that are most close to you. If you were to have. On the other hand, I think we have three community panels that we identified in the contract. Each of them, 12 people that are a microcosm of Portland. So 36 people are going deep into this candidate. They're researching the candidate. They're looking through the application material. They are interviewing the candidate. They're debriefing and debating. And those 36 pieces of data come to you. Well, that's. I would say that's pretty rich stuff. And it's stuff that's not from your best friend. So it really is about Voice of the Community. So that's my impassioned argument. Why? For those four reasons. And I'm going to be quiet and listen to the board discuss with yourselves where you want to go with this. There is one item that I want to make sure we talk about before we leave today, which is back to planning for next Tuesday's engagement. So let's, if we can, maybe five minutes before seven, just make sure we have a plan for next Tuesday.

end time: 1518:33:40.000

A: Gotcha.

start time: 1518:42:00.000
end time: 1519:41:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: So, yeah, you don't have to decide this. This part tonight.

start time: 1519:42:40.000
end time: 1562:48:22.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, no, I'm just putting the stuff out here that I. That I feel. I think, you know, transparency builds trust within our community. That's something that we desperately need right now. And if we, I mean, I just don't see how we talk about it. But then our actions shows us the. Shows the real truth. If our action is, oh, we're going to be transparent, we want to be transparent. We want to be open with our community. That builds trust. Right. Knowing stakeholders and parents, teachers, feel they included in the process, they're more likely to support the final decision that we make because they feel that they're engaged in this education system. We're here in Portland. A lot of people have not felt that way. And if we just continue with the status quo of not doing that, but then saying we're transparent, I think we lose the little amount of trust that we can gain or start gaining by. By doing that. Also, I think when we have an open search process, it allows for inclusion of diverse perspectives and ideas. I think when we just limit it to 36 people, I mean, that's not. I don't see how that's a representation of our community. You know, you could have. Even if you have two black people to expect, that's not a real. We don't get the whole diaspora of who we are, for instance black people. We have different viewpoints, we have different thoughts. So if we're only having 36 people, we're missing out on thousands and thousands or hundreds of people that could at least have some kind of knowledge of what we're doing. And I think it also makes for better decision making. Right. When we're transparent, it fosters a better decision. Decision making processes, you know, when criteria happen, you know, they're clearly, they're open, communicated. Then us as a board, you know, make more informed decisions, you know, and the needs of our parties for our district. And it also has accountability issue. Right now we're hold accountable for the decision we made. We can't just say, well, we made these in behind closed doors decisions. Well, if that's the case and the superintendent comes and sucks, I could be like, well, you know what? I didn't want them in the first place. Right. That accountability is not there for us as a board. So people can come and say, hey, you said you like this dude and now he sucked. So that's on you. So we avoid accountability where here in Portland, especially pps, there is a great need of accountability. And so if we don't start at the top with us, then I think we just perpetuate the same stuff that's been going on, which is unaccountability, not really transparent, even though we talk about it. So that's, that's, that's my, that's my thing. And I won't say that he's actually.

C: So I will say that whoever we pick as a superintendent, we absolutely will be accountable. I mean we sit in a meeting and vote so there's. Nobody's going to say like, oh, that that was Eddie's candidate because we voted for them. And I mean, we, we'll be definitely accountable whatever process we use, because we sit in a public meeting and vote on it. And we vote on contract terms and have agreement on that. So there's, there's full accountability. And I don't think anybody will be able to say it wasn't my choice, it was some other board members.

confidence: 0.95
C: Talking to lots of candidates. It does narrow the pool. So we don't know what candidates we won't see who choose not to be in it for a whole host of reasons. And I mean, one thing that candidates have told me is like, if somebody is the sole support for their family and they're going in and they may not get the job, they're not. It's safer just not to apply for it and just to keep their job, their leadership position, they have. I think there is a way, and I think we did this with Guadalupe and also with Vicki and I think Carol had the same thing, is that when you have a finalist, you can't have more than 36. I mean, they're public. We had community forums. They actually went to the editorial board. I mean, the finalist day was editorial boards. They went. They did a community forum, they did stakeholder tables.

But we had a community forum and we had this with Vicki where there was actually two people on the community forum. We got immediate feedback. We sat in executive session, read through the spent two hours reading through all the community feedback. Then we made a decision. We came back into a public session and we voted on a camp.

I know for a lot of community members when Vicky was announced, they felt that they were not part of the process. They were not. They felt like they was not part of the process. I can go down the list and name the folks who had a problem with that, but I don't want to. I don't think we have to do that here. And so I'm just speaking on that piece. When communities don't feel like they're part of the process, they don't feel they're part of the institution.

A: Argue with the wrong person. Arguing with the wrong person. I'm just telling you what they told me. I'm just a messenger. I think qualified candidates are more likely to apply for a position when they know that the selection process is fair and transparent. I don't, I don't understand why. Because something is transparent and fair and open, why would that discourage someone from applying? And if we're talking about, you know, long term stability, when stakeholders are involved in a selection process, when, you know, people are involved with this process, it creates a stronger foundation for collaboration and continuing in leadership. We had a lot of issues with superintendents as far as stakeholders wanting to be committed to this district. And I don't know if that's, I don't know about the whole process, but I think if we, if everybody's involved, just like you're saying, we want the whole board involved in this solution from the beginning to end. Why wouldn't. We wanted something different with our community.

A: Oh, absolutely not. I loved how. And actually that was one of ones I thought was a great, a great example. Memphis had a, I felt, had a great day talking to some of the board members that was there. They thought that process was absolutely wonderful. The second part, I don't know about the first part, but the second part where they had transparency. They had. And it was even great for me because you were able to see, like their questions and you able to see how candidates answer the questions. And they had a couple rounds of that. They had community rounds. I thought that was great because the community, their top three picks, the community was part of. They liked those top three picks. So I thought that was a great way to do something. Absolutely. Now, if you know something different from Memphis than I do, let me know.

H: Yeah, I. This is a fascinating discussion. I was watching, of course, the Memphis Shelby discussion and process really closely. I have not talked to in depth with the other candidates that did not get picked. But this. This idea about, like the pool of people that we will get. And, And Julie, I appreciate you. You brought up, you know, what if it's a sole. You know, a superintendent is the sole provider having to be vulnerable and maybe not getting the job and applying. I mean, what a perfect sol. What a perfect scenario. But I do feel like we should keep it. First of all, I want to keep it to what our consultants think is the best process for the first tranche and for the second tranche. Yeah, maybe we do have a bit of confidential confidentiality around it. I feel like Portlanders are really engaged and are going to want to be involved in every discussion and also just want to share that I was part of a. That the community could be invited in for the final interviews in a way that they understand that they don't have a decision, but that they. They. But they're. They're listening in and they're invited in. And it was part of a Department of Transportation directorship where the. The final three candidates had community forums. Community was invited to witness their statements and what they thought they'd bring, but didn't have any decision making. And so that's a way of bringing people in that especially, you know, say, from the black community. And Gary, thank you for saying that all black people don't think alike. I really appreciate that, that it is so true, but unless you're part of a. The group, you don't know that. But I feel like there's a way to kind of do a hybrid. A hybrid between being transparent at certain points in the process and also keeping it. You know, we want to get the widest pool as possible. We want to get the best candidates, we want to attract the best candidates. And if maintaining confidentiality, at least until they've had a first interview is, Is the thing that gets us there, I would advocate for that. And then we talk about being transparent once we have a solid three candidates. Because I think if you're one of three finalists, you understand that there will be a public process and that your name will be floated. And also agree with Julie about the Memphis. It was, according to Memphis board members, it was, it was really messy and that's why it took so long. It took months. Their process wasn't well defined. They outed people really early and it just, it was a mess and I'd like us to not do that.

end time: 1761:33:58.000
confidence: 0.94
G: This reminds me a lot because, you know, I did a lot of work in a lot of the debate around, like, representative versus direct democracy, because, you know, one of the principles of representative democracy is that you vote for a group of people who represent and can become experts in the decision making process instead of having direct democracy, which, you know, had a lot of social experiments that failed. And one of the nightmare scenarios I'm worried about is that, you know, sometimes you have situations where someone interviews wonderfully may not be qualified, may have the wrong qualifications. They just may be very charming and very, you know, just, just very good at becoming popular. And oftentimes you need to pick the ones that are also qualified and have the skill set to do the job. And I'm worrying about a nightmare scenario where it could create a rift between the public and, and the board in the fact that like, maybe the popular one is not the one we select for exactly those reasons. And that's, you know, that would be a nightmare scenario would. Now that would create even more distrust. So I can kind of see both ways. And I really appreciate this discussion. I think this is very valuable. But I just want to add my piece that this is this very perfect example of all the debate around representative democracy. Yeah, that's. That's my two cents.

E: My last thoughts Quick, because I know we're trying to get out is. I thought we were talking about the last three, that once we got down to the last three, we would. We would announce not everything up before. And I want. I just made this comment, and I think this was back when Julia was talking about them doing the walk around to go meet everybody. And my thought was when she was saying that by that time, did they really care? Because they had already essentially had the job and a contract had been negotiated, and they were going around shaking hands and kissing babies. So to me, that's more of a political. I need to smile. I need to do. I need to do my dance. Because these are people that I'm going to be working with versus if I don't do this right, I don't get a chance. And so that was my. That was. And so I'm thinking that was a rap. When you were saying that. That I would make a mistake.

You thought there were going to be two. You're the sole finalist. You're going to meet all these people today. We've already negotiated a contract, but certainly I don't think we would say, like, no matter what happens today, we're still hiring you. That was not the deal. I mean, very much the board was like, this is like your interview with the community.

C: Here's an example. Prior to the search, prior to that, there was a. There was a sole candidate. And actually, the board members went down to Atlanta and toured around the school. It was all very public. It was all over the media. And then, because they didn't do the full background check before all that stuff came out, and they. Even though he was the sole finalist and Everybody expected him to be hired. He was not hired because something came out from the background check that terrible. Led them to not hire him.

And I do think that, like, kind of thinking of it as the barrier to application is. Is one thing I'm considering. And it brought that up for me just because I feel like confidential, confidentiality wise.

I actually came into it pretty opposed to the idea of releasing names for all the reasons that you mentioned. I think those are really good reasons on your slide. But, you know, your passion around sort of releasing names is also, you know, it's giving me pause. And I guess what I. And I'll just say a couple of things. And I know, Hank, we probably shouldn't be saying this in public, but I don't think it's going to surprise anybody. What also matters to me is, you know, we're not in a particularly strong position right now.

F: You know, coming out of a strike, dealing with the budget cuts we're dealing with. So there's a dynamic in a recruitment, any recruitment, you do, right. You know, you sort of start off, you're like, you know, prove to me you want to be here. But then pretty quickly when you narrow it down, it's like, let me convince you about. And I think in this recruitment, we just need to be realistic. There's going to be a lot of convincing.

start time: 1835:43:30.000
end time: 1835:47:30.000

end time: 1838:24:34.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So there's, you know, yeah, we want someone. I agree with you, Gary. We want someone who desperately wants to be here, but we also are going to need to be really selling all the positives, of which there are many.

start time: 1838:26:02.000
end time: 1838:37:54.000

B: Right. And.

start time: 1838:39:22.000

B: Right?

start time: 1839:11:06.000
end time: 1852:18:16.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Away public schools. And so that's a factor. And I mean, Julia said it right. We want the best superintendent. And I think we would all agree that if a close, closed process got us a superior superintendent, we would go with the closed process. And if we all knew with hindsight that a open process got a better superintendent, we would all agree on that. What we're doing here is playing a, you know, it's a game theory, right? Like which one of these processes will bring us the best person. And I'm wondering if there's not, I mean, Julia engaged in a process where they're going to release two names. Is there a huge difference between two and three? You talked about releasing, you know, the five or six, but maybe there's a problem. You know, maybe what we say here is when you become an absolute finalist and we are down to that, you know, that's the point when we make it public. And I don't want to make a decision tonight because I actually want to think personally.

start time: 1852:18:48.000

B: But.

start time: 1852:44:32.000
end time: 1858:33:22.000
confidence: 0.97
F: But I. I wondered if there's. If there's a middle ground we could get to that sort of meets it. And I want to be clear. You're right about our community. If we do a closed process, they will attack us, and that will hurt the superintendent getting started. No matter who we pick, we have to balance that against who we may lose. Right. So, you know, how do you. That's.

start time: 1858:34:26.000

start time: 1858:51:30.000
end time: 1873:10:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: And I think if you end up going with the public process, too, you have to be fully committed that if you. You don't bring anybody unless they're a viable contender forward. So if that means you get down to three people and you go there, there's really only one that you don't be disingenuous to candidates and. Because when you get down to. As a board, there's really only one. These other two they may fall in love with. And you already know there aren't people you can live with. So if you decide any bit of public, it could even be that you only bring one, because if it wasn't that one, you're going to go back out anyway. So it's kind of hard to play it all out to the end of how many, because you also don't know the quality of the candidates. And I wouldn't bring somebody back that's.
