C: All right. Good evening. Good evening, everyone. Good evening and welcome. This is going to be a combined special meeting and work session of the board of Education with a consent agenda for January 23, 2024 is officially called to order. The agenda for the meeting and additional materials being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the board and meeting tabs. The meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. Our superintendent Guerrero is going to be able to make it today as he is ill and taking a seat tonight will be the Chief of staff, Mr. Garcia. Yes. Yes. I want to remind everyone to please keep walkways and aisles clear and be mindful of those sitting behind you. And if you have signs, please keep them at chest level so the people behind you can see as well. We have a full agenda this evening and I know there is much anticipation on a very variety of topics that we have tonight. All right, so I want to begin tonight meeting by recognizing the significant impact of the winter storms that occurred last week. All of us here at PPS would like to express our heartfelt sympathies for the lives that were lost to all the families affected. Please know that you have our sincerest condolences and unwavering support. You are in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time as well. We have witnessed considerable damage to our homes, our properties and our schools with some of them experiencing various degrees of destruction. So I do want to take a time out just to thank our staff who went out to assess the work that was needed to start making repairs, clearing walkways, clearing sidewalks and just trying to take care of the buildings. And they did that day and night throughout this whole process. So I just want to give a thanks to them. All right. Also we have given that we have schools that have sustained significant damage and are not able to return to normal operations. I wanted to make sure that we focus on them. At the beginning of this board meeting. It wasn't on our agenda, but when we have important issues, those rise up to the top. So I'm going to ask Chief Garcia if he can give us updates on those schools and the updates and the procedures moving forward. Thank you.

A: First, we want to thank we are thankful that all but a handful of schools opened yesterday. This largely results from our hard working facilities and operations team who have made a considerable effort to ensure these schools were open for in person instruction. And thank you Chair for acknowledging their incredible work this last week. I also want to thank the Governor's Office, the City of Portland and Multnomah county who have partnered with us and supported us through these weather related challenges. We were incredibly grateful to the Governor's Office for sending additional state plumbers and staff to our impacted sites which allowed us to repair impacted schools even faster. Unfortunately, some of our schools did experience extensive damage. Unlike other schools, burst pipes and flooding.

A: Buildings, water damaged plaster, drywall and throughout and disrupted the asbestos when ceilings pipes burst. And as we know, the impacted schools are Markham Elementary, Robert Great Middle School and the Kelly Center Head Start. Unfortunately, the impact of these damages is severe at these schools which will require a prolonged closure Our focus right now is on bringing back students to in person learning again. Our current focus is to bring Markham, Robert Gray and Kelly Center Head Start students back to in person learning as soon as possible. There is a huge sense of urgency to make this happen. We agree with our parents and educators concern that online learning cannot replace in person learning. Although some limited asynchronous instruction is available this week, we see it as a short term stopgap measure rather than a long term solution. This is why a large PPS team is actively working on plans for alternative in person locations for these schools. Our focus has been twofold to relocate students to one of our existing school buildings or if necessary, relocate to a third party site. Of course, it isn't just it is more than just finding a new location with viable capacity. We have other critical considerations beyond physical space including transportation, nutrition services, technology and security. We've contacted neighborhood neighboring school districts, pcc, Portland Parks and Rec and others to find options for spaces to relocate students temporarily. However, given the various considerations, our current assessment leads us to believe the most viable path forward is to relocate students to other PPS buildings as opposed to relocating to a non school district site. This may require us to split the student body between buildings, transform non classrooms into classrooms, and make other adjustments to our other buildings. For example, we believe we've identified a path to bring back our students at Kelley Center Head Start and we hope to share more with this community in the next few days. Determining the best alternative option for our.

A: Likely take a few more days, but we plan to communicate daily with the school board and the impacted school communities about the latest. Again, I want to thank our community for your patience and for your understanding as we navigate these challenges. We're available to answer any questions you might have tonight, but please know that we might not have some of the answers. Joining me at the dais is our chief Operating officer, Dan Young, and our chief of schools, Dr. John Franco, who's joining virtually to help me answer any questions you might have.

start time: 120:48:50.000
end time: 129:28:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah, it's a good question. We've pursued a bunch of different potential options and we're still looking at additional or still looking at options. As Jonathan noted, we think the best path forward is to relocate students to existing other PPS sites. Right now we're doing capacity analysis and really coming up with exactly what that plan is, specifically which students would go where, how would we accommodate them. And so that's happening right now and we hope to share more specifics within the next day or two.

start time: 130:16:30.000
end time: 131:21:58.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Thanks. And I mean, we're talking like 900 students.

start time: 131:24:14.000
end time: 131:36:22.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Approximately.

start time: 131:37:26.000
end time: 172:13:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Approximately 900 students. Which I think it both highlights the importance of and the urgency of it, but also just the logistical challenge. Right. Of, you know, moving 900 students to different facilities is pretty significant. And I appreciate. I'm going to. I know you said it twice, Chief Garcia, that the focus is really on getting folks back at in person learning as well. One of the things that I know we all heard from a lot of the community today was concern that that might not be the case. And so just want to reiterate. That's your direction. I think that's. I'll look at my colleagues. That certainly would be my direction as an individual board member. I'm glad we were able to do a little bit of asynchronous this week as a stopgap, but it really needs to be a stopgap and I appreciate it. Sounds like the state has been providing some support and some other governments as well. I know one of the things that I will just say, like there should be no other government that's getting their buildings fixed prior to schools. And if you need us to throw any of our, you know, political weight around, whether it's the city or the county, those contractors should all be schools first. And I think those governments would agree if they were brought into that conversation. So we. I hope we're not competing in that, in that sense with maybe the Exception of some, you know, life and safety, public safety things. But schools need to be first in that. And so I would also say, in addition, I mean, obviously, your first priority is getting folks back. I would also say, I hope whatever tools you need, you have. And if the board needs to authorize any of those, we're happy to do so, whether it's, I mean, you have emergency procurement rules that are designed for exactly this type of situation. The other thing I just have to note, this is what ending fund balances are for. We often hear from the community, why do you have such an ending fund? This is it. The cost of getting these kids either into their temporary location or back into their permanent school should not be the issue right now. And again, hopefully we can get reimbursed for these costs. I know we have insurance for some of it. Fema, I hope, given the state of emergency, will also be able to cover some of those costs, but we'll worry about the cost accounting afterwards and focus on getting those folks back in at this point. And the other thing I just want to note is how quickly things are changing. So this is one of those stories. I, you know, I have a kid in schools, not in either of these, but I can feel the frustration of the parents in terms of what's happening. You know, I also just want to recognize the short period of time in terms of when we found out. It sounds like the extent, like a lot of Oregonians, it wasn't until the ice melted that we could really see the full extent of what happened. And you and your team, it sounds like you've been moving really as quickly as you can in the meantime, right?

start time: 172:18:10.000
end time: 187:04:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah, it's been very dynamic over the last 10, 10 days. And I think. And we've got staff who've worked, you know, 15, 16 consecutive days, very long days, when last week, you know, as the weather was developing and the impacts were becoming clear. You know, there was one point in time where we were looking at roughly 11 or 12 schools that we wouldn't be open the following day. So we had contractors, we had staff working in dozens of schools, you know, responding to emergencies and did a good job of getting a lot of them opened and ready. We have these handful that still have this significant damage. So our resources have gone from broad to more narrow. And now we're still putting all the resources that we can to get in the schools fixed as quickly as possible, but also looking at where those temporary locations are. So it's very dynamic. Things are moving very quickly, removing resources around daily. Where we need them. And then on just the point, on the resources, we are working with the.

A: Federal financial recovery, mostly through fema. So we are keeping tabs and expect that the federal government, given the emergency declarations that we would receive funding to address some of these issues.

start time: 191:43:00.000
end time: 199:57:26.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, and so I would just say, I mean, getting the kids, you know, in person as quickly as we can, getting the buildings fixed. And then I would say the longer term is, you know, after the buildings are fixed, they're back in figuring out, you know, what, if anything, was lost in that period of time. Time. And then what those students may need, whether it's additional academic support, social, emotional support, the other things, sort of those wraparound services, you know, and, and I want to be clear, these are the two schools most impacted, but there are some other schools, right. That, you know, also were delayed in reopening and have a lot of damage. So this is affecting the entire, the entire district to set.

A: Okay, perfect. So, and I do want to also acknowledge that what Director Scott said is that we also had Ainsworth and Forest Park. I think in the opening comments, I think they were missed. But Forest Park, Forest park was also in that piece and shout out to Ainsworth because they, not only the maintenance staff, but the admin staff too, were able to do some things.

confidence: 0.94
A: Us to open the building to have kids this week. And they started today. So asynchronous by nature is flexible. By no means is it ideal. The good thing with now is that at the secondary level in particular, Canvas is an lms. At the elementary level it is seesaw. So there's opportunities there for teachers to provide schedules, but then also to upload work and then also to provide feedback. And so what you'll find in the plans is there are daily opportunities for check ins and, you know, attendance is also a big piece. And so what you'll also find in some of the plans is that if students don't access some of those distinct social opportunities that teachers are individually calling to check in. It's different than synchronous. Synchronous, as we've all learned, like during COVID synchronous is a little bit different where there's set time, where meetings happen in conjunction with the teacher. So it's kind of like a class, except it's albeit much shorter, but the asynchronous is a little bit more flexible with uploading of lessons. The big challenge with asynchronous moving forward is obviously it's not in person type of instruction, but it's making sure that obviously devices and those types of things are in our kids hands. The staff had to go pick up materials from classrooms and those types of things, but then also to do an assessment of students to see okay, so if they don't have that and they can't access any of that but then what does that look like from a paper pencil type of perspective. And so and so we're still working through that those pieces this week. Any other questions?

start time: 250:35:40.000
end time: 290:42:50.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So Director Scott covered a lot of topics that I was going to ask about. I do want to just acknowledge and thank staff for prioritizing getting students back to in person learning as soon as possible. When I asked yesterday, immediate response was that's a priority and I'm glad to hear it. There's a sense of urgency. I had a chance to speak to some Markham parents today and I will just say the sense of urgency they feel for their students just given everything that else has happened this year and then previously Covid they're very concerned about the loss of in person learning time and that the virtual learning, whether it's asynchronous or synchronous is neither one of them is the same as being in a classroom. So I think three things. It sounds like your focus right now is on looking at relocating to other schools. And I would say you have a lot of people in the community who also have professional expertise. So I would tap them if that turns out to not work because we have a lot of people who want to help problem solve. And not only did I hear from working parents but also from others today of what else could be done. So hope we take our community up on them wanting to see those students back in the classroom. The other this is another issue was raised and this is somewhat been addressed but I hope we'll continue while we're acting with urgency. But also that making sure that students have the Chromebooks hotspots or whatever it is they need so that they can at least immediately start accessing that. So if it hasn't already happened, you know, trying to the sense from parents they don't want to miss any additional time. And then there was also a question that I'm curious about for students in special ed, what sort of services if, especially if they're relocated to other schools, would they be accessing this the services they need from their new school community or their other school community. So in a sense we also students in special ed have had just the challenges, either from virtual learning or through the strike or the week of winter weather had additional challenges. So I'm curious about and maybe this is a question for Dr. Franco.

start time: 290:49:50.000
end time: 306:42:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I'm actually going to invite Jay Buno, our chief of student support services to respond on the special ed. Good evening. So we have an intensive skills classroom at Markham which actually we did move to in person learning. We have it at Jackson right now. And so they started in person today. And so they have their teachers and their service providers in person. And we had amazing staff, our Marcum staff and central office support, transportation and facilities that just made that happen very quickly. And so as soon as we're able to identify a spot for our Marcum students, we will rejoin them with them. But because of what you described and the experiences with asynchronous or synchronous learning, we wanted them in person as soon as we can. So we found a location and made them in person very quickly.

start time: 306:43:40.000
end time: 311:34:52.000
confidence: 0.91
F: So if you don't mind, just follow quick follow up on that. So the students mark them are at Jackson, so elementary students at a middle school. So ideally they would be eventually co located at an elementary school which yeah.

start time: 311:35:56.000
end time: 320:22:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Jackson is the feeder school primarily for them and they have an ISE classroom also. And and so a lot of the equipment and other resources that they have would be similar. And so because of that we and they had space that could easily accommodate them very quickly. And because of the time frame it made sense and we could get them started quickly. And so that's why we selected that. But yes, we will want to join them with their Markham community as soon as we can.

start time: 320:43:20.000
end time: 325:17:36.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So one last question. Just still on special ed. So students who have IEPs either at Robert Gray or Markham that aren't in that classroom, how are they getting special ed services or how so right now.

start time: 325:18:48.000
end time: 334:51:32.000
confidence: 0.95
A: And as is with their experience, every day they are receiving services as part of the general education classroom. And so their experience right now looks the same as any student does. And so as we move forward and identify spaces for all students at those schools, we will look at if we would need to do anything additional for them as a result of missed learning or missed service and make that up if need be, depending upon amount of time they would of missed service.

start time: 334:53:16.000
end time: 343:31:50.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So Director De Bass, I just thank you for that presentation. I was really curious about what we're doing about resilience for you know, we can't do anything about the weather, but as the weather does get worse and worse and we experience the impacts of climate change, what are we doing to. It's hard to be resilient for tree falling on your building, but what are we doing to build resilience into our buildings? Particularly as we're going to have the bond discussion, potential bond, on the agenda tonight. So for future planning.

start time: 343:54:50.000
end time: 356:21:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, it's a good question. It's probably a longer conversation. I mean, the thing that instantly comes to mind is all our modernizations have at least a portion of their facility, their entire facility. If it's all new construction that is designed to seismic level category four, which means it's intended to, after a large earthquake, be immediately occupiable again. Now it doesn't mean all utilities will be available. That means that the structure is there. So we're building in components to buildings as we modernize. Also opportunities for other resiliency options, but that's the one that comes to mind particularly. We also of course have our climate crisis response policy, which as we implement that will add to those resiliency capabilities.

start time: 356:31:20.000
end time: 360:50:20.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Okay, so we're just a follow up question. We're thinking about. We're doing bearing utilities, for instance, or doing building performance measures that increase the resilience in weather events. Or are seismic events enough to cover.

start time: 361:00:40.000
end time: 361:23:12.000
confidence: 1.00
A: Weather events as well?

start time: 361:24:56.000
end time: 363:24:16.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I mean, if we build it to a seismic standard, does that also account for, you know, increased heat and increased winter storms?

start time: 363:24:48.000
end time: 377:31:50.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Like we just. Yeah, I think it's a broad and kind of a dynamic topic. And certainly if you build for seismic strengthening that doesn't also cover all manner of potential disasters. So I think there is some more conversation in what those trade offs are when you build in additional options within the buildings. And I would say that I just appreciate the board's commitment to our response to the climate crisis because the board policy clearly outlines a path for us to address this issue of resiliency. And so as our team continues its effort to, you know, meet the goals set out by the board, I think that is going to be a much more, you know, prominent conversation that we have at the board level, including potentially tonight as part of the discussions around the bond.

B: Good evening, Board Directors. My name is Christina Howard and I am the Interim Chief Academic Officer. Not a doctor yet. I am pleased to share the facilitation night with several others. Dr. Emily Glasgow, our Senior Director of Pre K5 Core Academics, Melissa Schachner, Director, K5 English Language Arts and Social Studies, and Darcy Soto, Director of Learning Acceleration. Tonight, we are here to share about our Early Literacy Success grant application. We are really focused on the early literacy portion tonight. And on February 6, just as chair Holland shared, we will be providing you with an update on K12 ELA curriculum implementation. And that is similar to our K12 math curriculum implementation update that we did on January 9th. For our agenda tonight, we are going to start with our why and our approach to advancing towards educational equity. Next, Emily will share a brief overview about Oregon's Early Literacy Success initiative and information about the Early Literacy Success Grant application. Melissa, Darcy and Emily will take us through each of the allowable expense categories and share what we are currently doing in PPS and how we propose to use the grant dollars within each category to build on what we are currently doing. Along the way, we will share rationale and data points in alignment with our decision making. We will close out the presentation with the overall budget proposal around the grant dollars and allow for any questions you you may have. Next slide, please. So, just similar to the math presentation, we always ground our presentations and our actions and our why and our roadmap to educational equity across the instruction and school communities division. We believe our adult action should prioritize the three instructional instructional framework, high quality instructional materials and teacher professional learning. We believe by prioritizing and narrowing our focus and actions to the three instructional priorities, we will shift our student outcomes and we will advance towards educational equity. Good evening. Thank you. In 2023, ODE, under Governor Kotech's leadership, launched a new statewide early literacy framework, articulating both a vision and a roadmap for multifaceted investments and research based best practices to build a solid literacy framework for our youngest learners Birth to 3rd grade Our Superintendent and others within our PPS community were instrumental in advocating for this statewide prioritization of early literacy. The framework identifies four key goals. First, an intensive focus on investments, resources, and best practices that lay a strong literacy foundation from birth to third grade within the scope of PPS programs. This means an intensive focus on investments that support pre K through third grade literacy as an investment in the foundations that set all of our students on a pathway to long term literacy success. Second, targeted supports and investments in historically marginalized communities with a focus on reducing early literacy disparities for students of color, English language learners, and students with disabilities Third, a focus on supports to families and communities as critical partners in the early literacy landscape and fourth, an expectation that all districts in Oregon align pre K through third grade instructional resources and classroom practices with the strong body of research that we refer to as the Science of Reading. We'll share more about what this means later in the presentation. In pursuit of these priorities, our state legislation has designated targeted grant funds to support school districts with the challenging critical work of aligning with the vision and roadmap described in the Early Literacy Framework. These district grants are non competitive, application based and renewable. They are strictly earmarked for district wide work that supports pre K through third grade educators and students. As Christina noted, there are specific allowable expenditure categories that we're going to walk through this evening. For every category, we are responsible for articulating our current state and a data based rationale for continuing or new investments. We will also be responsible for ongoing reporting to the state on these expenditures. Our initial application was due January 8th. Tonight's conversation is an opportunity for public comment and board discussion. Our hope is that you will vote to approve our application on February 6th. Following board approval, ODE will award our grant during this startup year. We are allowed to use grant funds to cover approved expenditures back to October 2023, and we're also allowed to roll funds from year one to year two of the biennium. Overall, the state has designated $90 million for these grants to Oregon districts. During the 2023-25 biennium of that larger pie, PPS has been designated approximately $6.7 million, split evenly across the two years of the biennium. This year and next, we expect to be able to reapply for funding each biennium. Given this jumpstart timeline, we anticipate that the bulk of our first biennium funds will be spent in year two of this cycle. The 2425 school year and we'll share a detailed budget at the end of the presentation. Before I pass to my colleagues to walk you through each category, I want to just pause to share a brief reflection. The process of preparing this application has been validating, hopeful, and exciting, different than how we started tonight's meeting. Great. This is good news. I'm extremely proud of the work PPS is already doing in alignment with the Oregon Early Literacy Framework and national best practices related to the science of reading. We're well on our way. These new investments are an incredible opportunity to continue on our current path, but supplement and accelerate both adult and student learning. To ensure that our investments are translating to the student outcomes articulated in our board goals specifically for Black and Native students. I strongly believe these investments are and will be transformational for our youngest students and therefore for our system at large. So I'm going to start by passing to Melissa Schockner, Our Director of K5 English Language Arts and Social Studies, and she's going to walk us through our first allowable expense categories. Good evening. So the first category that we allocate funds of this grant is for purchasing Research Aligned curriculum. This is a place where PPS is ahead of the game and already well aligned with state expectations. The image you see on this slide is called the Scarborough's Rope. It is one of the central graphics used in the Science of Reading research to describe how young children learn to read. It shows how in the primary grades, young children need explicit instruction in all the components of foundational skills and reading comprehension, background knowledge, vocabulary knowledge, language structure, verbal reasoning, literacy knowledge, phonological awareness, decoding and spelling, and sight recognition or Phonics since 2018. PPS has been working on purchasing and implementing curricular resources to align with this research and as of the fall of 2022, we have had fully aligned resources in all K5 classrooms. These resources include Wit and Wisdom, Geodes, Foundations, and Hegarty. This slide illustrates how these resources align with and support the science of reading research. So what does this look like in our classrooms? Let me give you an example of what you would see if you walked into a third grade classroom now and at the next board meeting when we share an overview of K12ELA curriculum implementation, we can go deeper. On a daily basis, two hours are focused on reading and writing. So in a wit and wisdom 90 minute lesson you will see students reviewing two different books to determine the advantages and disadvantages of space travel to support their opinion essay Answering the questions Would you like to have been an astronaut on The Apollo space mission. They also learn about the importance of varieties of varieties of sentence complexity and review each of others writing drafts giving specific feedback about sentence complexity. This lesson addresses all the language comprehension strands of the Scarborough's wrote that you see at the top of the graphic in the foundations 30 minute lesson. You'll see pairs of students writing a core word and adding a prefix and discussing how it changes the meaning of the word. They'd write the word respect and add the prefect dis. Next, students now would have to practice all their cursive. They have all practiced all their cursive lower case letters and the teacher would dictate a few letters for them to practice. This lesson addresses decoding and basic handwriting skills to practice. Finally, in their day, there is an additional 30 minutes day called the win block. What I need in this win block is a time for students to get exactly what they need to accelerate their learning, which may be in reading or in math. With this grant, we'll be able to further develop curriculum alignment by extending explicit phonemic awareness instruction to our pre K classrooms with the addition of the Hegarty curriculum. The second category question before you move on. Sure.

end time: 632:44:04.000
confidence: 0.93
C: And then when you mentioned some of the stuff. I know we're going to go more deep into it on the 6th, but I didn't really hear you talk about the culturally relevant curriculum or material as well. Would that be talked more about on the 6th?

C: Okay.

start time: 633:10:20.000
end time: 639:54:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: But I will say culturally relevant is what teachers make of the curriculum. I'm going to echo the same thing my partner Chase Wood said. Culturally relevant is what teachers do for curriculum. It's the relationships you build with students. It's not a checklist. It's not curriculum. It's what teachers do with the curriculum that makes it culturally relevant.

start time: 640:02:30.000
end time: 641:32:30.000
confidence: 0.93
C: So will our teachers get trained on how to. How to incorporate that into their lessons?

G: Yes.

start time: 641:41:50.000
end time: 643:45:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Okay. We have a board member who would like an example of what that looks like.

start time: 643:47:50.000
end time: 662:56:12.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I'm sorry, I could speak for myself, but I kind of whispered that. Yeah, it would help me to get an understanding of what that means. Not the culturally relevant piece, but what. What is an example of how a teacher translates the space books that you just brought forward? How does that look to present that in a culturally relevant. Sure. I think one of the things that we get caught up on is that culture is not just about race. Culture is about many things. And I think we can go deeper next time. But culture is about thinking of yourself in many different ways. So in this unit they're talking about space. So would you like to be an astronaut is the question. Would you like to go out into space? Would you like to be an engineer? So it's opening up a whole possibility of different careers that students could be. And so that's a really great, great thought experiment the students get to have in third grade. So that's an example about how they get to explore. And so it's inquiry based based on what students interests are and that's culturally responsive. Getting to know your students.

start time: 662:57:56.000
end time: 664:20:12.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Thanks. I know. And I know we're going to go a lot more into it on this on the 6th too. So thanks.

start time: 664:22:36.000
end time: 770:06:12.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Yeah, you're welcome. All right, so the second category that we can allocate funds for in this grant is prefer for professional development coaching. Our current state analysis reveals that we're also on track in this category. All of our K5 teachers have been given the opportunity to be trained in our research based core curricular resources. Our school based coaches and school leaders guide our educators in professional learning cycles and classroom coaching to support deeper internalization and implementation of these resources. And we have invested time and resources since 2020 in supporting educators through the Letters Professional Learning Program. Letters is an intensive 160 hour professional learning experience that helps educators understand the science of reading research. In PPS, we have had 642 educators begin this training and as of January this year, 144 educators have completed this two year program and 369 educators have completed the first year of the program. Using grant funds from the Governor's Office, we partnered with MESD and other districts in Multnomah county this past year to study the impacts of investing in letters. That independent study is linked here for your review. But to summarize, we learned important lessons that are driving our planning for use of these grant funds. First, we learned that it's important for educators to learn the science of reading research. However, they likely do not need 160 hours of training and in reality this time commitment is not feasible for most educators. Second, we learned that professional learning around the research is most impactful when it is done in the context of a learning cohort and supported by coaching that helps educators make the connection between the research and their curricular resources. Based on our lessons learned, we are prioritizing the following extended or continued investments with the new grant funds in this category, Pre K will need additional PD to understand the phonological awareness and how to use the New Hegerty Curriculum we are also seeking an external partner to help us develop a year long compressed Science of Reading professional learning experience experience that educators can complete as a school team during contractual time. This experience would include basic understandings of the components of science or reading, phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluence, comprehension and coaching and professional learning around how educators can connect this research knowledge to the curricular resources they use in the classroom every day. With this grant we will offer year long intensive PD for approximately 20 schools per year to ensure educators and administrators have this basic knowledge and can apply it using our current curriculum. Our goal will be to ensure that all K5 schools have this opportunity within the next three years. In the meantime, we will also train all our school based instructional coaches so that every school has a resident expert in this area. Lastly, we know that teachers need time to internalize lessons and adjust lessons to support the students in front of them. We also know that Whitman Wisdom is a particularly complex curriculum that requires an ongoing unpacking and internalization and we also use this grant to provide release time for grade level teams to do this work with their school based coaches. Darcy, you want to do the third category? Delighted. Good evening. In expense category three, we're going to shift to talking about summer learning opportunities which is one of the required investments of the grant funds. So we've included both our Early Kindergarten Transition Program and our Summer Acceleration Program in the Early Literacy Success Grant proposal. Our Early Kindergarten Transition Program has been a partnership and investment in the district for over a decade. Each summer the program supports over 200 priority students successful transition to kindergarten at 18 of our highest needs schools. And so as part of the literacy grant funds, we'll be using those funds to maintain that investment and to make some program refinements to improve the literacy aspect of instruction in that EKT program. So we're really excited about that. And Summer Acceleration Academy is our four week academic program in the summer that is focused on providing students who are performing below benchmark in literacy with a successful on ramp to the fall through explicit targeted reading instruction as well as high engagement mathematics and STEM instruction in the summer of 2023. Last summer we served 2,278 students at 17 sites across the district. Those last year was funded by Esser and Braided funds with the Student Investment Account and supporting students in first through third grade. Those were the highest rates of participation and need in Summer Acceleration Academy. So we have some really promising data on a study that was used in 2022 with the curriculum that we used in 2022 and 2023 that demonstrated that our students in rising first and second grade in that curriculum experienced statistically significant gains over the summer in foundational skills. We're really proud of that work and really excited to continue to move it forward this upcoming summer. We're going to continue to use that curriculum as well as making some additional changes to the day to add in additional literacy instruction, time and support staff so that all students who are attending get the level of support they need in literacy with daily differentiated instruction, co teaching and small group instruction. And then we're going to move on to our last category, which is high dosage tumoring.

end time: 824:36:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And we're continuing to use that. Okay. Yep. Just moving on to high dosage tutoring. I'll be brief. Which is another required component of the grant application and also an area where we have already begun to best time and resources and where we have also seen some exciting preliminary results. We started in 202122 using Esser funds to launch high dosage tutoring using research informed best practices for third, fourth and fifth grade students in foundational skills during after school tutoring and continued that investment last year and expanded the impact to 22 schools with some promising results for those students again in grades three, four and five. And then had planned a broader implementation this fall to begin in early November. That would have provided an eight week cycle prior to today's date. But unfortunately, with the extended school closure and subsequent budget issues, that's on pause for the moment. But with the funds from the Early Literacy Success Grant, we'll be able to continue that work in starting in the spring of 2024 and beyond into the next school years. And we're currently developing resources for our earlier elementary students in first and second grade that will align well with our adopted curriculum and also allow us to scale that program to maximize the use of funds.

end time: 835:10:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: For everybody. Because I swear we've had presentations all fall that have talked about high dosage tutoring being offered to students. And this is maybe not your question, but like all the other presenters we've had has talked about this as a key strategy that we've had for catching up students. So I'm just curious. This is the first time I've heard that it was paused. Is it just a segment of the program paused or like all of it paused?

start time: 835:33:50.000
end time: 838:44:12.000
confidence: 0.96
B: It is a key strategy that we've implemented the past two years and was planned to begin following fall assessments to identify students this fall. So it has not yet occurred this year.

start time: 841:02:00.000
end time: 842:27:44.000

F: So there's been no high dose to tutoring this year.

end time: 860:16:50.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Correct. We have plans to pick that back up based on. Right. So it's a. Yet it's not a. It's because of the. Everything that has happened. Right. We had to reassess our budgetary decisions. And I will say high dosage tutoring is actually in a. It's a required, not just an allowable expenditure under this grant. So we have to pick it back up, and we intend to this spring with these funds.

start time: 860:29:20.000
end time: 865:48:20.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So I'm glad to hear that because often when we've asked, like, what are the strategies for our students who needed acceleration coming out of COVID One of the key strategies that have been cited that we're using is high dosage tutoring. So maybe I missed it, but I'm surprised we haven't been doing it this year.

start time: 865:54:40.000
end time: 874:19:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah. We have aligned those timelines with assessment timelines. Right. So that we can identify students for high dosage tutoring opportunities. And so that fall window would have closed in early October and then working to identify students. And the plan was to put that in place starting November 1st. And then just needing to take, obviously, a pause on that because we use our, you know, licensed staff and we have schools. Children in school for tutoring.

start time: 874:29:00.000
end time: 878:26:06.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So, for example, some. Sorry, one last question. So, for example, we approve this at the next meeting. When will students start getting high dosage tutoring? After the next maps testing period, or are you saying for next year?

start time: 878:28:38.000

B: Yes.

start time: 879:55:58.000

F: And you'll use the maps assessment of who could benefit the most in what particular area map.

start time: 881:51:10.000
end time: 892:32:32.000
confidence: 0.96
B: We've used map reading assessment, and we have now map fluency this year that we will also use to identify our earlier learners for high dosage tutoring and the timeline of how many weeks of high dosage tutoring we'll be able to get in before the end of the school year will just depend on a little bit on getting staffing going. But the plan is ready. It's been ready since the fall, and we're just hoping to implement as soon as we can get funding. So we have two more slides for you. I know Dr. Director Green has been very patient. Can you sit through two more. Do you need to do questions now? You got it. Okay. All right, I'm watching you.

B: We want to talk about the last allowable expense category and then just do a quick overview of the budget, and then we're ready for whatever questions you have. So the last allowable expense category is hiring that you might need to do to back up these various priorities that we're spending on the grant allows for hiring a very specific FTE roles in support of the articulated priorities largely for coaching, intervention and tutoring. Our current state analysis in this area revealed that we've already made a significant and relevant investment in professional development and coaching by placing school based instructional coaches in all K5 schools. However, it should be noted that in our current model these coaches are generalists. They're not curriculum specialists in that they support educators with implementation of all core curriculum across all core content areas in all grades. We also currently have 38 FTE across our K5 schools designated for direct student intervention. These school based positions are currently funded through a variety of sources. Our MTSS team provides some central guidance and support for these positions and continues to see opportunity for increased clarity, guidance and professional learning in this area. In terms of central support, we currently have one administrator, Melissa, our director of K5ELA and social studies, overseeing ELA work across our 60 elementary schools. Our analysis led us to prioritize the following extensions to support continued and deeper work in this area. We plan to create approximately six additional school based curriculum specific coaching positions. These would be early Literacy coaches. This cadre of coaches would be supported by our central office team and they would work with the 20 schools engaged in our year long Science of Reading Professional Learning sequence to help K3 educators translate their learning on research to classroom practice by providing in field coaching. The need for this extra layer of support is in alignment with the outcomes of the letter study discussed earlier by Melissa. We'll add seven additional school based student facing ELA interventionists supported and allocated by the MTSS department to ensure that our schools with the highest database need for early literacy intervention are equipped with highly trained interventionists. And we'll add just one central Early Literacy Specialist position to work with Melissa. The primary responsibility of this person will be to guide and support the 20 schools engaged in the year long Science of Reading professional learning experience and the cadre of early literacy coaches who are supporting educators in these schools. Schools so if we now flip to the actual budget, you have attached a much more detailed two year budget worksheet. This is sort of a high level summary of the biennium spending on this slide. You can see that we've prioritized investments in continued learning and development around tier 1 or core early Literacy instruction. This is the teaching and learning that occurs every day for two hours in every kindergarten through third grade classroom and every day integrated across the day in our pre K classrooms. These investments including the extension of our Phonological Awareness curriculum to Pre K, the year long Science of Reading Professional Learning Sequence, funds to support educators with unpacking and planning their wit and wisdom modules, and a small cadre of early literacy coaches supported by one central early literacy specialist. Those investments comprise 48% of our investments in the first biennium. Those are tier one investments. At the same time, we also know that there are students currently in our pre K through third grade classrooms who are already in need of intervention and acceleration. Therefore, we are also investing a significant amount of funds in this first biennium to extended learning and intervention. These investments, which include additional school based early literacy interventionists, continuation of both Early Kindergarten Summer Transition and our Summer Acceleration Academies, ongoing high dosage tutoring comprise 47% of our investments in the first biennium. Given the jumpstart timeline, the bulk of our funding will be spent during the second year of the biennium, the 2425 school year. With the exception of things like high dosage tutoring that we'd be able to get off the ground right away as soon as these funds are released. So that brings us to the end of our presentation. We welcome questions and discussion and we hope that you will vote to approve this application on February 6th so that we can embark on our next steps of our early literacy transformation in pps. Thank you for your patience with us.

D: I will. In light of time and because this is just a presentation about the grant itself, I want to approve the grant. It's not that I don't want us to get the money, but all of my questions are going to be around that I will be sending out will be around. In light of the comment that I kept hearing tonight, the tone of to continue on our current path that we know we're doing this stuff to continue on our current path, I just want to state that our current path is not working. It sucks. Our kids can't read and we're not talking about that. We're not talking about the reality that if we continue on our current path, then we're going to continue to have a bunch of black kids that can't read. They're good students and I love to have this child in class, but they can't read. So stop telling us that our child is good and that they're great and they can't read. And so every question that I have that I'm going to send out that I would hope you be prepared to answer on the 6th is going to be around what are we going to do? What are we Intentionally doing to not continue on our current path, but to actually get our kids reading. Because you said in one of the things that all K5 teachers, and I quote, have been given the opportunity to be trained. So to me, words are important. Words are actually extremely powerful. They're some of the most powerful things that we have. You've been given the opportunity, but did they take it? And so if they didn't take it, then they just got the opportunity, then they're part of the problem. And I want to go on record as saying, as much as I love everybody here, I don't have a problem cutting you if you're part of the problem. I don't have a problem saying it's been real. I love you, I think you're great, but you have to go because if you're not going to do what we're paying you to do, I don't want you, period. And it's, I mean, it's not that I don't like, like you. I just don't want you here with my kids. And so I'm, I just. Please understand that every one of my questions are going to be very targeted about what we're doing with our black kids. And I have a very high, a very unapologetic black agenda. And I say that all the time. And I. So I want to be very, very, very clear that although I'm not going to ask all my questions tonight because of time, I will be sending them forth and I want to know what we're doing to destroy the current path, establish a new path that's going to work for black kids. And that's what I want to. I want to see.

confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah, we're looking forward to them. No, I. That's great. We appreciate the press. It's the right press. It's the right question to be asking. And I guess one thing I just want to say quickly is the path we're on today started last year. So this actually is a new path. And so I just want to keep saying that to you guys. Like we didn't have this full alignment of resources until 2022, meaning that we don't have any third graders who have come pre K through third grade with this full continuum of early literacy aligned instruction. And so I just want to keep reminding people of that, that we're looking at a very lagging data set when we look at third grade data, when really we've started something very new at the early learner's end around literacy right now. And so we will continue, obviously, we're excited to see your questions. We'll dig into them. We'll be ready on the 6th to give more information. And I do want to just keep reminding us we are on a new path, and I think that's exciting.

B: Absolutely.

start time: 1031:24:00.000
end time: 1049:29:30.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Can we agree that if we're waiting to third grade, then we've already created a problem that we need to be. We said we were giving money to. To programs that were doing pre K work, but did we qualify whether or not they actually got us closer to the mark? Because I don't want to just keep giving money to people simply because that's the old hat. And we always give money to these people. I don't really care who we give the money to. I just care that they're teaching my kids how to read. So I'm not just going to keep giving you money because I don't like you like that. I want our kids to read. And if a stranger, somebody that I don't know, someone that, you know, that we don't have all these deep relationships with, if they feel, if they're more enticed or more like got a bigger push to teach our kids to read so they can prove themselves, so that they can prove their worth versus I always get this money. So I built my budget on it based on I always get it. And I ain't really got to do no work for it. I want to fire everybody, you know, so. But I'm gonna stop.

start time: 1052:53:42.000
end time: 1062:46:26.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah, I read that it can extend into 4th and 5th grade. So in year one, there's a very small allowable expense to extend into 4th and fifth grade. So year one is now in year two, that gets even smaller. So we have designated a small percentage of this budget, which you can see in the detailed budget worksheet, to fourth and fifth grade. And that comes in the form of the science of reading professional learning. If they're in that school cadre by the end of the first biennium, that's going to expire. And these funds will only be for pre K through third grade, beyond the first biennium. Okay.

end time: 1080:09:10.000
confidence: 0.92
F: I've got some. So I have some questions around how this, it's a little bit similar to Director Green's but how this is like integrated with our other investments that we're making. So let's just take the science of reading. So we have a, we have the coalition of the willing that 143 educators who are fully trained and we in the budget looks like there's going to be 20 more schools, all schools trained.

start time: 1080:24:10.000
end time: 1085:24:12.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So what we're looking at. So what the mini training? Yeah, the 143 is the folks who went through the 160 hour full endorsement level letters training. Folks can still do that through MESD if that's still something they want to pursue. But we're looking to try to get all 60 schools, all educators, through a compressed version in the next three years.

start time: 1085:25:56.000
end time: 1086:00:00.000
confidence: 0.91
F: So all educators of the 20 schools.

start time: 1086:07:00.000
end time: 1086:44:00.000
confidence: 1.00
B: 60 over three years would be our goal.

start time: 1086:57:40.000
end time: 1087:52:28.000
confidence: 0.93
F: And so the last 20 are. They don't need it.

start time: 1087:53:24.000
end time: 1088:59:56.000
confidence: 0.91
B: There are 60. There are 60 elementary schools. So we're talking about elementary schools. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

start time: 1089:00:28.000
end time: 1089:23:12.000
confidence: 0.90
F: Okay. So. So by the time this is all.

start time: 1089:23:36.000
end time: 1089:49:04.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Through, that would be our goal, the.

start time: 1089:49:12.000
end time: 1091:09:52.000
confidence: 0.95
F: 2 million, the whole goal. So there's not. You can choose to do it or.

start time: 1091:11:36.000
end time: 1092:17:40.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Choose not to do it with your support. That's our goal.

start time: 1092:42:00.000
end time: 1098:08:10.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Then I had a question just about the pre K curriculum. So the reason why we're paying for that curriculum is because our bond, our 2020 bond, is supposed to cover all the curriculum, all subjects, all grades. But we didn't include money for pre K. Is that why it's in here?

start time: 1098:23:50.000
end time: 1112:32:22.000
confidence: 0.97
B: That's a good question. I don't know if you want to answer that. I mean we have a pre K curriculum. It's called Tools of the Mind. It's a full day integrated curriculum. And we've been doing a lot of analysis on which literacy components of that curriculum align well with our current science of reading aligned approach in kindergarten and beyond. And what we found is there's a lot in our curriculum that already works. And then what's missing is this really strong phonological awareness part that Heggerty offers. Heggerty is 10 minutes a day. It's a very, it's a small addition. And this grant felt like the right place to locate that funding because, you know, as you know, in a time of diminishing resources, we're trying to use allowable expenses for what they're allowed for so that we can, you know, free up other expenses for other things. But I think when you look at the detailed budget, you'll see it's a pretty small expense. We can look into the bond question for you too and get back to you.

start time: 1112:34:06.000
end time: 1127:51:26.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Great. So the question about the Summer Acceleration Academy, which, having visited the last couple summers, seeing students getting lots of instruction and looking at the data to see that it's helping kids. I'm curious about the slide where it talks about 22, 2,278 students at 17 sites. And then it says maintaining funding for Summer Acceleration Academy for identified first and third grade students at nine sites. So is there going to be or is this for the upcoming budget? Is there going to be. Will there be funding for the other students that aren't included? This. Is this just the specific funding for this grant, but we're still going to maintain the supports for the other students because we know lots of other students need it and would benefit from it.

start time: 1127:52:38.000
end time: 1132:39:30.000
confidence: 0.96
B: That's part of our budget conversations coming up. So those are. We're in that work right now. And for tonight's purposes, we're talking about the allowable expenses on the grant and the required expenses. Right. This is a required expense as well as high dosage tutor in the other areas that we spoke about.

start time: 1132:51:10.000
end time: 1142:04:40.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Yeah, I guess I'll just put a pin in the conversation until we get to the budget because it seems like, yes, this is for the grant, but we also want to have a holistic strategy because there's kids in all of our students in all of our schools who need this need high dosage tutoring. So like I say about grant, I'm with Director Green again, I'm going to be supportive of it, but I also want to make sure that we're just not doing a piecemeal or portion of our students for programs that have demonstrated results.

start time: 1142:25:40.000
end time: 1152:44:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, I'll say we do hope to have as robust a summer program as the budget allows. And this portion is just for those grades because it's an allowable expense. These sites we have identified 10. I think there's just an error on this slide, identified 10 hub sites. So they're not. That's not specific to certain schools, but rather those neighboring schools, as we've done the past two years, three years, that this will be the fourth year of the program. And we do anticipate having fewer hub sites, but still serving a large number of students at neighboring schools of each of those sites.

E: Very good. Thank you, Marina. Dan. Thank you, board chair and board directors. As you all know, obviously back in December, the board passed a resolution to reassess plans to modernize Jefferson High School. And in that resolution, there was a revised plan that would keep students and staff largely on the Jefferson campus during construction, design the school for a targeted student enrollment of 1700, demolish the 1909 Jefferson Building, seek to conform to PPS's high school ed specs area program and not include co location of the cbse Tubman or other unaffiliated entities to the Jefferson campus. So since then, the project team has worked with the city of Portland and their staff to get more information about land use requirements specifically so the city has provided information about two potential pathways for demolishing the 1909 building. The first would be to request to delist the property from the Piedmont Conservation District. And the second would be to request a demolition permit specifically for the 1909 building. So the project team is now working to put together information for a formal early assistance conference with the city in mid February. And that's the first required step to either of those pathways. We've also been working pretty much nonstop with the design and construction teams to review site layouts and keep student that keep students on site at Jefferson during construction. So our design and construction teams and the OSM team and stakeholder groups in the district are considering what buildings, either existing or new, will need to be provided to students with academic, athletic and community programs during construction. So we intend to. Staff intends to bring a draft, present a draft information to the Facilities and operations committee on March 20, and that will be followed by a board presentation on April 2nd. And this information is anticipated to include a rough cost estimate for the revised plan. So that's kind of a high level overview of where we are right now. But certainly we'd love to receive any questions from you.

B: But there's different.

start time: 1225:31:02.000
end time: 1228:23:24.000
confidence: 0.95
E: There's a higher bar for that in terms of what is presented and who it's presented to. And the type of land use process. It's called a type three process.

start time: 1228:24:52.000
end time: 1228:41:48.000
confidence: 0.78
B: A type three review.

start time: 1228:44:04.000
end time: 1229:41:20.000
confidence: 0.99
E: Exactly. So there's a higher bar there, essentially.

start time: 1229:57:40.000
end time: 1232:37:48.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So does the path forward, in terms of the clearer path forward, is that delisting the property? Because I've actually seen an example of.

start time: 1232:40:04.000
end time: 1233:22:00.000
confidence: 1.00
A: This not too long ago.

start time: 1233:44:30.000
end time: 1234:16:50.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Is that a clearer path for us?

start time: 1234:21:50.000
end time: 1240:57:46.000
confidence: 0.96
E: I think that was sort of our initial impulse as well. I think there's some details included in each of those pathways that we have to really work with the city to understand because there's different implications with each of those pathways. But I think that's certainly our first instinct is to really pursue that in some ways, potentially more structural, straightforward approach.

start time: 1240:58:58.000
end time: 1248:41:56.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Okay. And then are we going to, for the delisting, have to go through a historic preservation review? The delisting is a type 2. It's type 2, yeah. So it does not need to go through that additional layer. It's a slightly different pathway. And so I think what we're discussing with the city is what are the best ways to move that forward? Until we get, I think, some indication from them as to which way they're.

start time: 1248:42:28.000
end time: 1249:43:16.000
confidence: 0.99
E: Leaning, we'd like to have some understanding.

start time: 1249:43:48.000
end time: 1250:30:28.000
confidence: 1.00
B: From the city as to what they think is the best path forward.

start time: 1250:31:24.000
end time: 1250:54:40.000
confidence: 0.99
A: We're still finding that out.

start time: 1251:01:00.000
end time: 1257:53:24.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And while we're figuring that out, we're basically moving forward essentially with both or finding ways to move forward with both. I would be really interested in just being briefed or updated as we get more information about that land use process. Certainly. I think the early assistance meeting is really critical for us. Has that been scheduled already? It has been scheduled. Great.

confidence: 0.97
D: I want to appreciate you guys for hearing what the community was asking and moving in that direction. And you also said that you guys have been working non stop, essentially nonstop since that time, plowing forward. I guess the question that I would like to ask is how much community involvement, when you say community, like the stakeholders, how involved have the community members of that area been involved in that process every step of the way? Do we have a listing of what community stakeholders we have carried with us to make sure that even if entire groups, but maybe representatives from those community, those community events can come so that when we do end up where we think we're going to end up, that it doesn't turn into another situation where it was like y'all essentially told us what you had done versus carrying us or bringing us along the way and we did this. And so I'm trying to create. See how. Make it.

start time: 1276:41:26.000
end time: 1276:45:18.000

G: Sure.

start time: 1276:46:14.000
end time: 1280:39:50.000
confidence: 0.97
D: I guess I would say I want to make sure that we're creating a we conversation and not an us and them conversation. Because I don't think with this particular situation there can be us and them. It has to be a we or it's going to fail.

start time: 1281:13:46.000
end time: 1283:01:46.000

B: At this point, our biggest concern is understanding which of the existing buildings might.

start time: 1283:02:58.000
end time: 1284:35:32.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Allow us to maintain programs during construction and which won't.

end time: 1286:05:24.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And also the same with our athletic field. So we're really looking very internally in.

end time: 1286:26:44.000

start time: 1286:26:52.000
end time: 1286:56:52.000

start time: 1287:32:20.000
end time: 1289:05:40.000
confidence: 0.99
B: And we need to understand what the capacity is for the different buildings and what that might mean in terms of.

start time: 1289:06:20.000
end time: 1291:28:04.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Phasing, moving different parts of the construction around. So at this point in time, it's.

start time: 1291:28:52.000
end time: 1292:28:04.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Really a reassessment of the existing buildings.

start time: 1292:30:12.000
end time: 1292:59:32.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Not just 1909, but there's a number.

start time: 1292:59:56.000
end time: 1293:41:08.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Of other buildings on the site to.

start time: 1293:42:04.000
end time: 1294:18:40.000
confidence: 1.00
E: Understand what the capacity is for those.

start time: 1294:29:00.000
end time: 1295:02:12.000
confidence: 0.99
B: And understanding what that might mean in.

start time: 1295:02:36.000
end time: 1295:46:44.000
confidence: 1.00
E: Terms of where we put different things.

start time: 1295:49:32.000
end time: 1297:10:12.000
confidence: 0.96
B: There's a lot of sort of background work that needs to occur before we.

start time: 1297:10:36.000
end time: 1298:20:00.000
confidence: 0.99
E: Can present any kind of information about that.

start time: 1298:27:50.000
end time: 1326:46:34.000
confidence: 0.96
D: And that's why I think I would challenge us to say that we need to involve the community in the background work. Because if they understood that we were looking at this building and why we were looking at that building and why it was necessary for us to look at this versus looking at that they understand why we're doing it, then it's easier to be. Because to feel a part of the process, to feel heard, because I actually had a part in it. So to me, this is just. Just me. I'm one guy. I can't speak for all the black community. I can't even speak for all of my family. But when we. When we create tables, when we create tables and say that we're doing this because we're trying to figure out what's best and we exclude people, then we're. We're leaving a voice, we're leaving a thought, we're leaving an opportunity out of the equation. I want to challenge us to say in every step of the way, whether it's the background, the middle, or the foreground, there needs to be somebody or some representation from the community there so that the community can own this from the beginning to the end, and not just this is what they gave us to deal with. So I'm going to challenge us to say, get the community involved in the process. If all we're doing is looking at the rooms to say we're just trying to figure out his word, that's great. Let them sit in the room and just let them hear and let them listen. I think we need to have the community involved in every aspect of it, or I'm gonna say it again. This will fail. It's going to come back on us, and it's going to be the same thing that we heard the last time. You did not listen to me. You did not give me a voice. So I'm a challenge everybody at the table, and I'm a challenge everybody over here. Let's get out of our own way.

start time: 1326:48:02.000
end time: 1326:50:32.000
confidence: 0.48
A: Let's.

start time: 1326:50:46.000
end time: 1346:18:10.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Let's get out of what I feel or what I think. No one cares. Let's bring the community involved, let's get them, make them a part of the process, and let's build something new together. And I think that's the only way it's gonna work. Because even if we. When we do it that way, I feel. I feel I'm using I statements. I feel that when we do it that way, it allows the community to own the process. The other way does not. So I'mma push you, Ms. Marina, to say, I know we said it. It's the background noise. Before we get to the foreground, I want to be a part of the background. And I believe if we took a vote, they would say they want to be a part of the background. So let's figure out, in my opinion, I know I can't just say for everybody, but we need to make them a part of the background. And if there's something that I need to do or people that I need to talk to on this end of the table to say, hey, who? How do we get them involved in the background? Then I'll go talk to all those people. I'll rally up three more votes. I won't rally up seven. I'll rally up three more votes to say we want them to be a part of the background. And then we'll have another special meeting and we'll say make them a part of the background. But I think that's what we need to do. But that's just my opinion.

end time: 1366:40:00.000
confidence: 0.97
F: First of all, I want to thank Chair Hollins for adding this to the agenda. I think looking at the 2020 bond, this is one of the ones that we absolutely need to get right. This was the heart part of the bond and the largest investment within the bond. So I really appreciate you adding it to the agenda. I appreciate the update. Keeping our focus on moving it forward, I think is going to keep moving it forward because we can do all the other $800 million worth of things in the bond, but if we don't do this, we will not be successful. So just question about the two pass. Are those city approvals or is like the council approval or city appointed entities that approve it and then is it appealable or both of them.

start time: 1366:53:00.000
end time: 1367:26:12.000
confidence: 0.98
A: They are both through city entities.

start time: 1367:27:16.000
end time: 1368:16:04.000
confidence: 0.88
E: They're both appealable. They're both appealable all the way to Luba.

start time: 1368:16:52.000
end time: 1376:20:14.000
confidence: 0.94
F: To Luba. Okay. Which potentially is a longer process. So we. I would suggest we try and figure out which one has the least possibility of getting referred to appeal to Luba and then on the site layout. So just make sure. I understand. You will bring proposed site layout layouts and a proposed new design to the March Facility and Operations Committee meeting.

B: Yes.

start time: 1376:41:20.000
end time: 1378:21:28.000
confidence: 0.93

start time: 1378:23:04.000
end time: 1378:34:48.000
confidence: 0.97
A: That's right.

start time: 1378:37:04.000
end time: 1388:18:20.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Okay. And then it would come to the board. The board would provide approval. We'd have to get approval from the city on one of these listings. But then the project could move ahead. I know that made it sound easy, but I mean, that's essentially the design would be required, done. And then the other piece is more the political piece. But in theory, if all goes well on the one of the two paths, we could have an approval of the project, of the new design by April.

start time: 1388:52:40.000
end time: 1389:32:16.000

The organization is developing plans to redevelop Portland Lower Albina area, including the home to the Dr. Matthew Profitt Education Center. Tonight's presentation comes almost three years after the PPS School Board unanimously approved Resolution 6303 to support the redevelopment of the 94 acres of Lower Albino. This area was once housed to thousands of black residents who were forcibly displaced during decades of urban renewal. So join us tonight. We have avt. Oh, shucky. Now here we go. Yes. Yes.

And before I start, I just want to thank everybody who is sitting behind me. We know this is no small commitment on your time. So you have our word that next time we invite you to join us at a school board meeting, we will provide dinner across the street at our office. So you can hold us to that.

So before we start, you know, at the Albina Vision Trust we have a practice of starting all of our meetings, particularly our big public meetings with grounding from our elders. And so tonight I'd like to invite Ms. Sharon Gary Smith, who serves on our board and whose family home is on Dixon to provide us that welcome. And because we believe in intergenerational perspectives, I'm also going to ask JT to come here to provide a welcome before we jump into the presentation.

This is the second time maybe in the last 20 years that I've entered this building because it's sitting on my parents land. My parents, my community. All of the members of the audience, many of whom lived in a thriving, joyful, well ordered, striving and thriving community that was Lower Albina.

D: The Donnas and the Dennises and the Stennises and the Pats and all of those. The brothers who looked out for me because I was oldest daughter of a family of four little black girls. My daddy, a Tuskegee man, Frederick Douglass, Gary Jr. And my mother, the audacious Bobby Lou Moseley, Gary, who showed up and showed out at the school district, not just for her daughters, but for all of the children in the neighborhood. We nurtured and we grew and we believed. And everybody that's behind me only in this moment, everyone from the community, holla. This is home base. So thank you for allowing us to welcome you back into our home space and hopefully this moment, this opportunity to listen, to be engaged, be informed, to be instructed on what it means to make big decisions that are good for more than a few. Perhaps we leave here tonight allowing a very vision, a dream that an audacious smart as all get out young woman from the community imagined, articulated and put into place. And we know when you put good things in the universe, they spin around and catch others. And although she's soft spoken, she's a badass. And we're here because she never let up. She never gave up. Rukia Adams, she spread like bees spread from fruit to pollen. And we're here because we can imagine you joining us in turning asphalt and cinder blocks into a community of community cultural. The joy of having to be welcomed come on back home. And I hope that your decision making without pause will be about conscience and conscientiousness, about returning fallow ground so it can grow again for this city, this community and every one of us that loves being here. Thank you and welcome everyone again.

G: Okay? So we join you tonight as proud graduates of Portland Public Schools. We also consider ourselves survivors of Portland Public Schools, and we are moved to this work now as developers, because we have dedicated ourselves to make sure that this is not true for future generations of black Portlanders. We do not want their success to be in spite of Portland Public Schools. We want it to be because of. We don't want to give up our capacity to dream big and do big. And so everything tonight sounds like it's about buildings and spaces, but it is about the well being of students, families, and the next generation of Portland public school students. We know that connection to place is the transformational investment for sustained collective outcomes in education. Our neighborhoods are containers for investment that reflect back whether we are cared for, whether our lives matter at all. And so we remember that on May 25, 2021, exactly on the one year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd. Portland Public Schools, Multnomah county and the Albina Vision Trust came together at our last hearing to cement the critical first step in our partnership to safeguard the future of Lower Albina through the right of first offer and right of first refusal. As we look back at that moment, we remember that there was not a single dry eye in that zoom room. Many of us had to turn our cameras off because we couldn't contain the level of emotion. This is because it marked the beginning of a pivotal trajectory. Director DePass, you reminded us in that meeting that you would use your authority, as then the only black member of the Portland Public School Schools board, to build on the legacy of five generations of black Portlanders. We believe you and trust you will hold to this promise. Director Scott, you conveyed to us then and many times since your belief that government can chew and walk at the same time, that your experience across multiple jurisdictions will be critical leadership that you will continue to bring to this board. We believe and trust you will continue to provide that. And Director Brim Edwards, you moved us deeply in 2021 with your recounting of your childhood in your K to 8 schools, watching children be bused to your neighborhood schools and realizing that there is a story of two Portlands, one that JT has so clearly talked about. And you committed then to not one action, but a continuum of actions to build one connected Portland. Those were your words then. And we trust and believe that you will hold true to building one connected Portland. And so after 2021, you gave us a mandate to do three things. One, you told us to gather the community. And the image on the screen reflects renderings from a process that has since engaged thousands of Portlanders to help us develop what a child centered neighborhood looks like. We know that we need to create the kind of spaces where everyone can keep eyes on the kids, where multi generational living is part of it, and where education spills out of the classrooms into everything that is built here. This is what the Albina Vision Trust seeks to build at this current site. Number two, you told us to go gather the capital. We did that. We have become excellent conveners and facilitators and have since brought over $70 million in new investments to Lower Albina, including through the development of Albino One, which breaks ground, which will welcome. Which broke ground last year and will bring 94 new families to the district in 2025, just two blocks away. This is the first time we're welcoming families here. In four decades. And because of the North Northeast preference policy, most of these will be families that have historic ties to the neighborhood. And number three, you told us to gather the plans. You said Portland Public Schools needs to study its options more but has no funding to do so. So we did that. We secured a Metro grant, threw those dollars over the wall so that you could conduct an independent Phase two study to assess your current building and look at options. You spent two years conducting this independent, thorough study, which we'll speak to today. So after following your wisdom in these three critical steps, we've come back to say it's time for you to act. And we enter this room trusting that what you do will match what you say. And with that, I would like to introduce Mike Wilkerson, who will walk us through some of the findings of the Phase two study as we head into our presentation. Thank you.

A: Thank you, Board Chair Directors. Thank you for your time this afternoon or this evening. My name is Mike Wilkerson. I'm the Director of Analytics at Echo Northwest, and I've had the distinct pleasure of working with AVT for a number of years now. I think just to acknowledge what I'm about to say is hopefully interesting, but certainly nowhere near as important as anything that Ms. Sharon or JT or Winter has just shared. So with that, I'll jump into, I think, what is largely going to be around talking about the unique market opportunity that face us as us today. But before doing that, I think it's important to ground that opportunity in a brief discussion and understanding of the financial reality of the status quo today, and particularly as that relates to the capital and operations funding requirements for, for the district. So first, in terms of capital, I think just to acknowledge, this has not been studied extensively in any recent history. And so there is a wide range of uncertainty. And that wide range of uncertainty is presented to you on the screen here, which is to say in a phase one study looking at deferred maintenance of this facility a number of years ago estimated that at about 14 million. Since that time, no real extensive work has been done looking at that. But an acknowledgement has been made in phase one and Phase two that any deferred maintenance could trigger a seismic requirement for retrofit. And again, those dollars haven't been specifically studied. What we did is we engage industry stakeholders who have expertise in seismic retrofit and said, for a building of this type in today's conditions, what would that roughly cost? And that range, again is wide because until you get into the bones, you don't Fully understand what that is. And again, that range could be from 40 million to $80 million. So, again, depending on what we're talking about here, there's a large range of uncertainty. But I think in addition to that capital unknown capital risk, there's also a risk to operations. And that is to say, in an unplanned unknown event, the likelihood is, again, it would trigger a seismic requirement which would require vacating this facility for an unknown period of time. And that causes a disruption to both operations and the ability to deliver service to the district. So I think those are the challenges. And in summary, again, the status quo risk is significant but unknown. And importantly, it's unplanned for. And so I think, again, the risk here is for the District is the ability to consistently deliver service and provide resiliency. And the current status quo is not allowing for that opportunity. So that's when we turn to the next slide, please, where we can talk about what the current market opportunity is. Next slide, please. Thank you. Which is primarily around decreased market prices. So the current interest rate environment, particularly for debt on commercial real estate, and the current high vacancy rates in commercial office buildings downtown have created a unique opportunity where acquisition costs can be 30% or more less than they were a number of years ago. And that is a unique opportunity. Why is that a unique opportunity? Well, the number of buildings that are suitable, so at least 125,000 square feet is likely to grow in the future as vacancy rates continue to rise, particularly in downtown. And why vacancy rates matter? Vacancy rates matter because, one, they impact the value of the building. But two, if you have to relocate a large number of tenants, that is challenging and costly. And so really, it's about buildings that have suitable locations, suitable characteristics, and have generally low levels of occupancy are those unique opportunities. And so while valuations are down, the market hasn't really decreased leasing rates for a number of reasons. And so what that suggests is the opportunity today is really centered on acquisition and acquisition for owner occupancy rather than for speculative development. This is a short window of time, particularly when we're looking at high quality office buildings because of the high vacancy rates and interest rate environment. I'm not here to suggest that this is the bottom of the market. That is, nobody knows. But what we see today is building consensus amongst economists, including the state economic adopted forecast, that we are likely headed towards a soft landing. What that means, effectively, is the Federal Reserve has likely stopped raising interest rates and will enter a period of time where they're going to Start decreasing interest rates. When that happens, how quickly that happens, we don't know. But what we know is this is a closing window of opportunity that starts today and ends in the near term. Next slide, please. And so what is that unique market opportunity? The map on the last chart showed 82 buildings within the city that meet only the minimum square footage of size. We understand that size alone is not the only criteria for evaluation. As part of this, when we look at the distribution, what we see is the vast majority of those buildings are on the west side of the river. Of the 10 that are on the east side, roughly half of those are designed for medical office or government, are much too large or have strong vacancy, and therefore we don't see any immediately candidates for acquisition. But on the west side, we do see of the 70 or so buildings, some are too large, some are brand new, some have high levels of vacancy, but there are at least 14 options that look suitable. And again, not to suggest that size is the only criteria. I think what this is suggesting is further study is needed. And what the due diligence period will allow us to do is look at other priorities. Transit, public safety, public space, and certainly suitability of fit. And that that due diligence period is really what is needed. Additional studies looking at scenarios aren't capable of providing the specific data that you would need to make a decision. So around cost timeline and specifically looking at things like warehouse or other central facilities that are needed. And so that due diligence phase is really where you're able to get the needed specific data to make a decision decision.

start time: 1819:32:10.000
end time: 1876:33:20.000
confidence: 0.96
G: So I want to jump in here to add that this due diligence period is part of the set of actions that we're asking you to do. So the pivotal change here is that we are asking you to commit to relocate and then there will be a time period for due diligence. Director Hollins, I promised you that we would show you our homework in terms of looking at properties on both sides of the river. And you can see see here that it's pretty clear already. We're always happy to look at more that it's not just the compelling economic case for the west side, it's practical. So in addition to square footage, we added a lens of additional criteria based on what we heard was important to you. So we looked at locations that have parking on site, parking that had gathering spaces for meetings like this, and that were transit accessible. And so when you factor in those criteria, it's even fewer options. And yet they are all on the west side. And so we will present those to you. Assuming that you say yes, we'll relocate. Let's enter the due diligence period. But I'd like to pivot here to talk a little bit more about the proposal itself. Next slide please. So while Carly will walk us through the various options, there are a few important top line messages that are clear to communicate. One is that we know there are no easy sources of funding for maintaining Central Admin. Right. Voters don't want to put this on a bond for buildings for administrators. That just doesn't do well. So we recognize that. And we also recognize that it would be more responsible to move forward with what is already a cost neutral option. So what we will share with you tonight is that we'd like to form a public private partnership with Albina Vision Trust to move forward with a cost neutral relocation wherein we facilitate the acquisition position of a high quality downtown office. And this last point is really critical. We are not asking you for a concessionary transaction. This is a market rate transaction. The value of the building acquired will match or exceed the value of this site. And I don't know that you would ever find another anybody else who comes to you saying, we don't want any of your money, we just want you to do the right thing. And in the process, and in the process, we will solve your problem in terms of the financial liability while sharing tremendous benefit with the broader community. And so as, as part of this, we know that the right of first offer defined the WHO avt. But we need to move now from the IF to the conditions that will allow us to make this final. And so with that, I'm going to ask Carly to walk you through the analysis of various options to show how we get to a cost neutral scenario.

B: Thank you, Wynter. I'm Carly Harrison, the Director of Real Estate at Albina Vision Trust. You can go to the next slide. So what we at AVT are proposing is a cost neutral option to pps. And we want to show how our proposal compares to the best alternatives that PPS has concluded from both the phase one and the phase two studies that were completed. So we'll start with the status quo. What if PPS stays in the PEC site? The cost of the status quo, as Mike mentioned, is not zero. PPS really only has three options that kind of vary between them. If they choose to stay, option A and B will look familiar as the numbers that Mike alluded to. And they show the cost of choosing to do nothing and being forced to react to system or structural failures. And option C is really the full renovation of the PEC site. I'll note the 14 million, as Mike said, is is only if deferred maintenance and critical system upgrades are addressed and doesn't address the seismic. And so we know that that can add significantly. These numbers don't also factor in the five years of construction cost escalation that we've seen since that original 14 million was estimated. So I think that's a very low end and we're fairly sure that the best case scenario wouldn't be the situation that we're all in. So lastly, if PPS chooses to intentionally and fully renovate the peculiar, including a full seismic upgrade, Option C shows that the total net cost would be 220 million and that was actually one of the most costly options that were studied and concluded. So the partnership with ABT showing a net cost of zero is actually savings to PPS over the status quo of at least 14 million and upwards to another tens and tens of millions of dollars. But to quote the Phase one directly, any investment in the building will not increase the value of the Dr. Profit site because the value is in the land. And so any money invested in this building by anybody is actually throwing money away. And I think that's really important here. So what if PPS relocates and how does partnership with AVT compare to those best alternatives? You can go to the next slide. The Phase two study evaluated many different alternatives for relocation and these three right here are the best ones. I'll note that these numbers show the net cost of PPS after already applying the sales proceeds from the site, and they focus on the cost of relocating the office only, not the warehouse. The warehouse will be very important and will certainly be addressed in the early next steps with pps, but it's not in this analysis because its inclusion just adds the same amount of cost to every single option. Therefore, it's really the difference that stays the same between all of these options before you so the best options were D construct a new office building, E acquire an existing office building and F lease office space instead of owning it. Option D assumed a new headquarters would be built on land already owned by pps, which is saving in land costs, but it still came out to be A net cost PPS of $123 million. Option E assumed the purchase and build out of the Exchange building in downtown Portland, which happens to be one of the 14 options in our slide, and this came at a price tag of negative $35 million. And lastly option F compared Leasing office space instead of owning it, specifically the Liberty Center. While the initial sales proceeds were positive, in this scenario, PPS would end up having an annual rent payment starting at about $4.5 million, escalating at 3%, really, in perpetuity for as long as you needed to have office space.

G: So.

start time: 1942:55:48.000
end time: 1953:38:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And you wouldn't have an asset to show for it. So when you take the net present value, as the study did, of those lease payments forever. And really, we just looked at 99 years alone, the net cost to PPS for this option is over $100 million. So as you can see, and as concluded in the phase two study, there was no scenario where selling the PEC site fully covered the cost to build, buy or lease another option. But by acting on the current market now in partnership with avt, we can cover the full cost for your relocation. And this partnership does so much more, which I'll pass to Wynter to elaborate on. Thank you.

G: Next slide please. So our commitment is to making sure that by giving you the opportunity to act today, you will not be bonding for a failing building tomorrow. And when you ask us what does this have to do with our core mission of educating children, I want to point you to all of those numbers that you saw in the red. These are investments you could instead be making in neighborhood schools. Which is why we are proud to have the support of so many, including the teachers union, Portland association of Teachers, who recognize that moving forward with this relocation frees up bandwidth in neighborhood in classroom investments. Additionally, I want to point you to next. Well, before we go to the next slide, actually, I just want to point out that in this image, the street grid you see here is actually where Portland Public Schools stands today. So you can see the homes in the neighborhood that was replaced here. But Kara, if we could go to the next slide. So in addition to the cost neutral relocation, there are a number of benefits that come to with a partnership with ABT that cannot be easily monetized, but that are equally important. So we know that bringing more than 1,000 units of housing here will be a key part of stabilizing enrollment in neighborhood schools. And we see this as a critical part of the Jefferson modernization and complementary to the more than half a billion dollars of investments you are already making in the Albinhead district. Those investments in buildings and schools need to be complemented with housing that brings our people back into the district. And so not only will you maximize your investment, we also recognize that as you saw in the image before, which had about 350 homes. Portland Public Schools, as a dear mentor recently observed, is the largest squatter in the city of Portland. You are sitting on what should be more than 1,000 units of housing. We don't think that is acceptable, and we think that that should be factored into the cost of staying put. Additionally, we know that these kinds of transactions are incredibly complex. Complex. And as you see on the slide before you, there are a number of added benefits. We seek to be as flexible with you as possible. What we want is commitment and to get to a collaborative timeline. You would not have that kind of flexibility with another private buyer. We know, too, that your internal teams are at capacity. They have shared this with us. We've heard, heard this from you. And so we are prepared to bring resources to help with that. We will bring teams of professionals that can help us move forward in this transaction, including what Carly referenced in terms of the warehouse function. We know that that's a critical component. We have commitment from Port of Portland Metro and others to be collaborative stakeholders in helping resolve those issues. So those kinds of additional public partners are exactly the ones that we are best positioned to bring to the table so that we address the problems in a sequential way that makes sense and moves us forward beyond the analysis. As Mike said, we will never be able to get to real decisions until we get out of the hypothetical scenarios that are offered as part of planning exercises into the context of real deal structure. And so, next slide, please. And so said differently, there are a few other reasons we've heard you ask why now? And in addition to the fact that this is 50 years overdue, we'll start with today. We know that the real estate market will have a short window. What the graphic shows here is that, you know, while the value of the this land can increase later in a stronger market, the cost of relocation will also increase. And so the window for a cost neutral relocation is now. We know too, that there are private and public partners ready to mobilize both capital and technical support so that we can move forward with the redevelopment of housing and community here. And that the biggest question is whether or not Portland Public Schools is serious, committed, and on what timeline. And so those are the questions we seek to answer today. And finally, as you consider various bond proposals which we know are on your agenda later today, we see this as an opportunity for you to demonstrate sound fiscal leadership. You have the opportunity to solve a problem at no general cost to you. What better way to show voters that you are serious about how you maintain your capital assets? And so, next slide, please. So here are the proposed next steps we have. The work session is today. We'd like to come Back to you February 6th with a resolution for your consideration that authorizes the preparation for the sale of the profit site. Within 30 days of that, we'd like to work with your teams to create a 30 day work plan and after that six to nine months so that we can identify and commit to a new headquarters site. Of course, this would be done collaboratively with all of you and your teams. We just want to help solve the problem and from there we know that there will be a significant due diligence period and of course the tenant improvements you'll need to make and the relocation. We expect that that could take anywhere from 18 to 36 months. But we would work on that exact timeline with you. The critical ask today is one to is to a date for a resolution and to move forward with something that looks like this. So next slide please. So in closing we're reminded that the time is now, the place is here and the people are ready. And because we always have to include culture into everything we do, we are honored that Grammy award winning artist Esperanza Spalding actually wrote an original song for this hearing. And so we're going to play one minute of that song and as Kara as you would press play, we're going to invite everybody, everybody in the audience, you know, mama or I'm sorry, Senator Gordley is on the call. She's in the Zoom Room and she reminds us that what we have not lost here is the capacity to create a beloved community. And so in that spirit, as we listen to one minute of the song from Esperanza, we're going to encourage you to greet your neighbors and say hello before we head into Q and A. Thank you.

I also want to appreciate the presentation, the thoroughness of the present presentation, how you left no stone uncovered. I want to appreciate that. I want to appreciate the reality that you pulled. You were very intentional and methodical about the heartstrings that you were pulling on. Like you, you, you shared no expense. This was, this was very intentional. So I want to make sure that I highlight that my heartstring was pulled and I didn't even grow up here. And so I want to make sure that that is noted. And again, I'm await to see how some of this other stuff around the rest of the dais goes. But I just want to take a moment to pause and to say thank you for bringing us back to. It's not about simply saving buildings as much as we have a larger obligation to build and save communities and very intentionally about the black community. So I want to make sure that I intentionally pause to reflect and say thank you for that. So in the midst of you calling me a squatter, you also reminded me of my obligation to play a role in making sure that the things that we do today are intentional about building a better future tomorrow for the young people and might I add, the young black people that are going to be in it. So thank you.

I know when we develop, we think about a building and a space. Have we looked at travel miles of people that would work in Central Admin? Do we know where people are coming from?

A: In terms of making ease of access? It's just a question, Director DePass. I can answer that. Some of the initial studies have looked at the impacts of transportation, although I will suggest that it was at a very high level. Obviously, if we were to move in this direction, the due diligence would be to further examine Transportation, parking and other those elements that are important to any office space.

G: Thank you, Director DePass. And on your travel question, you know, the river is such a barrier that it feels worlds away as JT spoke to, which is why we need to cross it. But I want to remind everybody that the options for the most part are five minutes from here. Right. And so everything we're looking at will be accessible to transit. We'll have on site parking and easy access to the freeways. And so I don't know that travels, that the miles traveled will be a big difference differentiator. But it's also important to remember that the heart of the Portland public school system are the neighborhood schools, not the central admin building.

F: Sure. Thank you. And jt, you're very compelling. But I'm an East sider and it's. The river is a huge barrier. And I think, you know, when I think about it, for our families.

F: Live on the east side, the majority, most of them do, I do think it is, I think a mindset of it's. And it's the other side of the river and it's hard if you're from here. And that's part of who you are. Like making that sort of leap across the river and what it represents because it's more the place of where commerce happens versus I think the east side has a very different feel to it. So since I was on the board almost 20 years ago, I feel like I've been looking at this project for almost 20 years and the deferred maintenance has always been there. The desire for a higher and better use of this land. And I think of all the proposals that have been made to date. So if I compare this to baseball, I mean, so much more compelling, so much more compelling. And so I love the vision. And in the 20 years we've looked at it, I think this is like the best vision and it's the right fitting for the place. So from my perspective, this is something I want to make work. I do know from looking at it for 20 years and also from my just work professionally in sort of space planning and real estate, doing work around the world, that it's really important that you make sure when you're relocating or designing a new building or retrofitting that you're looking at what the functions are that you're moving. And from my perspective, I want to be really thoughtful about the functions that are here. I think it's less complicated than 20 years ago because we used to have the largest commercial kitchen on the West Coast, I think on L3 or whatever floor that was way down that you went on the third grade. I know you went on this JT the third grade tour of the PPS kitchen. So we don't have that now, but we have a lot of other functions. And then how do we thoughtfully do that? I think if we were moving just administrators, it would be for me a pretty easy call. I think it's just more complex and I want to make sure that I do my due diligence that the functions that really are in service, we can call it admin, but they're actually in service. They're in service to our families and our schools that we make sure that we have places where they land and they land in a cost neutral way. So I like the compelling vision. I love the cost neutrality of it, because I absolutely think for me, we need to make this something that doesn't cost. Because as we talked earlier tonight, our resources are scarce and we want them to be laser focused on our students. So for me, I want to be able to understand fully that we can the functions that serve our families and our students and our schools have a function place in which they'll still be efficient and effectively able to serve them. Because even though this is a sad, sad excuse for a building, it does provide services to our schools and our students. So I'll understand how each of those functions, besides just the office functions work because to me that's sort of the more complicated side of it versus just the admin. So I'm, from my perspective, I want to make it work and I want to make sure that we've done our due diligence from my perspective as we due diligence as a board member, that we find a way that we can still maintain those services that are important to our families and also make, I mean, many families come to this building, whether it's not just for Board meetings, but just daily and things that their students need and we need our, wherever we are located, continue to be a welcoming place for families. And so that's sort of my other big criteria. And I will say right now downtown is not a very welcoming place to families. And that makes that sad for me to say as a person from Portland, because we had a beautiful town downtown. It's not so beautiful hold right now. And the crime rates and everything else that's happening downtown, I mean, that's something that we have to factor into it. And yes, PPS could be a large employer and make a difference, but also we need to make sure that our families feel like comfortable and safe and can access the headquarters because lots of things here are really important for our families. So those are just my like high level thoughts. And I can do a very deep dive on the functionality and of the space planning that I'd want to see and work it out. But in my mind I can see how it could work out, but I also want to see like just how the details of how it actually would work out.

G: Thank you for those comments, Director Edwards. Brim Edwards, you know, we know that when, when you are committed to seeing something happen, it does. And so we don't take it lightly when you say you want to see this happen. You know, as far as the warehouse function, that is a critical part of this, but there's been a chicken and egg sort of situation here, right? Until the district says, yes, we will relocate our office functions, there's little incentive or ability to figure out the warehouse functions in a real context as opposed to hypothetical planning context. Which is why what we're asking you to do is answer the first part of the question which I'm hearing, you know, you're supportive of, which is, yes, let's relocate the office function and within the due diligence period, make sure we can understand and have appropriate solutions for the warehouse function. So we are cognizant of both, but we need a decision on one to enable the partnerships and solutions, frankly, for the second. And I know JT wants to jump in here on east side, west side.

confidence: 0.96
C: And just to tag onto what Wynter is saying about the functionality question, solving that first question, answering that first question will actually allow you to optimize the location of your separated functions. Right? Whereas everything right now is clustered into one area. You described it as a place downtown, as a place where commerce happens. This headquarters is currently located in a place where nothing happens. So I don't really see any reason for us not being able to think a little bit more critically about what it would look like, like to actively.

C: To serve as a barrier. I was blessed and fortunate, as you well know, to be able to experience life on both sides of this river. Growing up. I grew up three blocks away from Jefferson High School. I lived there my whole entire life. Most of my life was actually concentrated there. I played sports there, as Gary well knows. I played for the Whitaker Warriors. That was my football team. I learned how to play basketball at.

C: Like, this is my side of the river. But I benefited tremendously from being able to cross the water and be exposed to commerce, be exposed to business people, be exposed to families and communities that lived up in hills that I didn't even know existed in my city. There's tremendous benefit to fluidity of existence and exposure. And I don't think that that's something that we should so willingly, I guess, brush off the table here.

E: I'll be quick. Thanks. Thank you for the presentation. It was great. And I mean, I'll just say right off the bat, I hate the this building. And I've always hated this building. I had to work in the Portland building for about 15 years. I thought that was the worst government building, pre Portland building. And then I came here and I realized this one's even worse. What's been really interesting to me is learning over the last few years about sort of not just the history about Alpine Division and what you're aiming for. And again, the whole context has given me a much bigger reason to hate this building. Right. And a much better reason to think about what to do about it. I had a lot of questions, but you've answered almost all of them, so I don't know if I have that many more. I'll echo what a few other folks have said. I mean, I think making sure it's accessible and there's parking and is going to be really important. And meeting space because Gary said he loves it when two or three hundred people come. I'm okay with it. I mean, I wouldn't mind if it was only 30 or 40, but I mean, it's fine. I think the framing about the cost of maintaining is really important. And so that's a good framing for any sort of infrastructure, capital conversation and one that often gets left out. So I just really appreciate that. That's what you brought to the table was, you know, it's not cost neutral to stay here. It's actually very expensive to stay here, and that puts a little bit of a different spin on this. So, you know, I think there are some outstanding questions. I really appreciate that the next step is due diligence moving forward, and. But I'm also really excited there's an opportunity here to right a historical wrong. And I don't know, I'm sort of honored to be in a position on a board that might be able to do that. So thanks for bringing this to us.

So I'm just going to start talking, and then y'all are going to help me figure out where I'm supposed to go. So I guess what I'm looking at, because I've been listening to everything that we've been talking about. I'm trying to take into consideration the presentation that was just done, and I'm trying to understand and wrap my head around process.

D: Okay. So if, again, understanding process for me, I think I've had some conversations with some of you before, and I said my concern was not what, you know, if we moved or not. I am a creature of habit. If I say it today, it still has to be true tomorrow. And I said that I would bring it up if it didn't come up. And so this is me doing exactly what I said I'm going to do, because the way you get me is to bring my word back. So if there's a person in here that takes notes, just bring my words back. The process, the issue was the process. It was like, move. I haven't even told you I want to move, you know, And I think that was the step that needed to happen first, that we actually say, and we say out loud and we have a consensus to say yes, we want to move. Now that we've said yes, we want to move even though it's not a vote. This is just a direction type situation. This is just. Are we interested? I think then we have to. Are we ready for the resolution? Like, is that going to be a voting resolution on the 6th? So on the 6th, when they come. Because she has, as I'm hearing it, and I could be wrong. I could be wrong. It wouldn't be the first time. But what has been presented is that she is proposing that they would bring to the February 6th board meeting a possible resolution that we would in turn look at review. It would have been worked with our team. And then at that February 6th meeting, we would be voting yes or no on accepting and adopting the resolution. And then depending on how that vote went, then we would get into these other pieces. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, is that the same consensus around the table that we're all sitting here with the understanding that on February 6th, we're going to be voting one way or another on a resolution that says we're either moving or we're not. So essentially, you poop or get off the pot type. I think that's what they're trying to tell us. You either poop or get off the pot. Which is fair. That's fair. Because if we're going to, you know, I'm saying if we're not going to do it, why just stay here thinking about it, right? You know, figure out what we're going to do so that you can figure out what you're trying to. What you need to do is what I feel like is being said. But I just want to make sure that from a. From a process perspective, that the rest of the rest of my colleagues, that we are all on the same page. On February 6th, are we gonna be voting? Is. I mean, and if we're not, then are we gonna tell them to do something different? That's what I. Cause she said February. And so that's why I'm throwing it out there. I can tell time.

A: And so, given the direction of this conversation, what I imagine would happen over the next two or three weeks prior to February 6th is to review, assess any resolution that AVT is proposing, you.

end time: 2469:19:26.000

end time: 2472:39:26.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Where we're going, what is it that we need, and you know, how quickly can we do that. So there's a lot of work that our staff would have to do, but I think over the next two weeks.

start time: 2472:40:38.000
end time: 2474:01:50.000
confidence: 0.97
D: It'S really about, I think, solidifying the.

start time: 2474:02:30.000
end time: 2476:00:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Board'S collective voice through a resolution, which again, we would work in tandem to.

D: Co create and share it with you.

start time: 2477:33:20.000
end time: 2494:41:20.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Okay, so I'm just, I'm hearing from everyone, just kind of, kind of want to wrap everything up. What I'm hearing that we have a consensus that yes, we would definitely look at relocating from this building as soon as possible. What I would like to say, and I'll put it on the record now that, you know, I think from this point on, we need to be, we can work towards a resolution. Not going to guarantee it's going to be February 6th, but we will work towards a resolution that could include the process of what that looks like, what the joint venture looks like, what the due diligence process looks like, like, and we can start really getting into those next phases. So I'll just put that out there now. That is, I definitely think the move or this next steps is working towards that resolution that gets us where we're trying to get to. Any. Any objections?

start time: 2494:51:00.000
end time: 2495:01:00.000
confidence: 0.93
F: So.

start time: 2495:03:00.000
end time: 2495:18:04.000
confidence: 0.84
C: Oh, that objection.

start time: 2495:18:52.000
end time: 2517:39:50.000
confidence: 0.96
F: No, it's not, it's not an objection. Sorry, you had, I was going to. Starting to speak before you. Any objections. So. One thing I know from our work on the board is we do our best work when we also have thoughtful deliberation about it. So I think conceptually we've agreed we're interested in moving. I think coming to a meeting where we haven't had an intervening public discussion and then having a vote on something is not what I would recommend. I would not recommend having a resolution brought to the board where all the work happens behind the scenes and there's not board discussion. I feel like I always benefit from hearing from my colleagues. And since we're a public body, we have to meet in public. And my preference would be for the board chair to bring forward a resolution that we can have a discussion about that we work actually at a session, have A work session on. At a meeting versus something just gets posted up, or that there's, you know, serial public meetings happening among board members to make sure that we're all okay with it, which I don't think is great practice.

start time: 2519:15:00.000
end time: 2520:53:48.000
confidence: 0.96
B: What you mean a meeting with just us or another public meeting or what?

start time: 2520:54:44.000
end time: 2532:41:20.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Well, we don't have anything before us, and I think it's a pretty significant. So I, you know, just looking at the numbers, hundreds of millions and being able to make sure that we have the functionality that we need to operate a school district and. And from a financial standpoint, for example, say our due diligence shows that it's not cost neutral. What does the board think about that? Are we willing to put money in the bond? Are we, you know, we still want to move forward, or are we willing to use some of our other resources? And, you know, I think those are things that we should talk about, but.

start time: 2532:42:00.000
end time: 2533:19:40.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Talk about at a regular board meeting.

start time: 2533:26:00.000
end time: 2534:35:00.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Because we have to be in public, right? Well, that's generally best practice.

start time: 2535:12:40.000
end time: 2536:58:08.000
confidence: 0.90
C: It'll be that or a work session. Okay. So moving forward, we will go ahead.

start time: 2537:00:24.000
end time: 2550:47:30.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Director Hollins, I'd like to offer, you know, we will clear our February to make sure we have all the sessions necessary. So maybe the next best step is to bring a resolution for discussion on February 6, and then to have the vote happen a week later or something like that. So we're open to whatever set of steps you think most appropriate, so long as we're working towards the passage of a resolution in February. And, you know, in the timeline that you had ahead of you, a number of questions can only be answered in the due diligence period. So the resolution is not the transaction itself. It just says, yes, we'd like to move forward in due diligence towards a transaction.

start time: 2551:02:30.000
end time: 2559:26:00.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I think that's a great point. And it was actually. You said it a lot better. I was trying to formulate it, but you did. I think the point about seeing the resolution is really important, but the resolution is about we want to take this next step and then we're going to engage in some due diligence, which case some of these other issues might come out. So I guess I just. I feel like we had a really good discussion tonight, and we've gotten a lot of questions answered. So, I mean, I will just say, personally, yeah, I want to see the resolution. So as soon as that's ready, that's great. If that's ready for the February 6th meeting and we can discuss it then, I think that's a Perfect timeline.

start time: 2559:27:20.000
end time: 2562:51:50.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah, I'm with Director Scott on that. I feel like we had some discussion tonight that we move this forward without delay, that we allow ourselves the opportunity to have a discussion.

start time: 2563:33:30.000
end time: 2563:50:42.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Next at our.

start time: 2563:51:06.000
end time: 2564:35:10.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Next meeting, but not to add another meeting. Please.

start time: 2565:09:30.000
end time: 2569:01:32.000
confidence: 0.97
F: One more meeting. We already have another meeting. And I would just say I don't think it's good practice. We don't have a resolution in front of us. So while we've had a good discussion and we had a presentation, we haven't had a discussion about what is the. Like what is the.

start time: 2569:01:56.000
end time: 2569:05:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: What.

start time: 2569:05:40.000
end time: 2570:48:40.000
confidence: 0.97
F: What are we voting for and the trade offs. The trade offs. And so.

start time: 2571:13:40.000
end time: 2576:27:30.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah, so gotcha. So let's move on. So what we do is we will get with AVT and start looking at the resolution and getting those pieces, and then we can come back with the board once we kind of got something together, and then we can kind of move forward from there.

start time: 2576:37:50.000
end time: 2601:53:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: How do we make sure that the. How do we make sure that our staff has a. An understanding that we. We want them to be working with that staff so that we can figure out, like, what this looks like? Because I think it should be. Shouldn't it be worked with it in conjunction. Like. Like, say this is important. Us. Like, how do I say to Jonathan, who's sitting over there representing the superintendent, that this is extremely important to us and something that's imperative that we want to make sure that this gets some attention. Necessary understanding that I can't direct staff. And so I would never. I would never presume to direct staff, but I want to speak to the person that I'm supposed to be able to direct and say this is important, so let's make it a priority and figure out time shift schedules, do whatever we need to do so that we can get some people sitting down with those people over there so that together they can bring something back so that there's no discomfort on this side of feeling like we have not done our due diligence and we haven't been intentional and that we've been sitting around waiting for somebody else to do all the heavy lifting for us, but that we have. We're showing a. An invested interest that we want to know just as much as they do as to whether or not this is going to work for us, and we're going to be very intentional about figuring it out in the most timeliest fashion possible.

start time: 2602:05:30.000
end time: 2612:02:50.000
confidence: 0.97
A: So. Vice Chair Green, appreciate the question you have. This board has been providing this type of direction for the last three years. And I think, as we heard aloud and clear Today ABT is ready to move to the next phase. And I, based on this conversation today, I think, you know, staff will regroup and connect with ABT on how we move forward given today's conversation. But again, I want to reiterate that this is been a commitment by this school board for the last three years since May of 2021.

start time: 2612:59:50.000
end time: 2627:00:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Just really briefly, if I could brief like 30 seconds. So my, my only gentle push here would be that y'all have in fact had time to review this information. You guys had, if I'm not mistaken, correct me if I'm wrong, a work session last week where you reviewed the fates phase two study that you commissioned and that Echo Northwest partnered on with you on. So the, the numbers aren't going to change in the coming weeks. It's the same information that's just been presented to you today. You should have access to this deck. You will also have continued access to the end of this deck, which very clearly outlines what we propose and likely what will take the form of a resolution. It's not going to be anything new that we're putting forth on the 6th. We will be putting forth exactly what we told you we put forth today. So just for the record.

start time: 2627:36:10.000
end time: 2641:29:38.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So since we can't talk about executive session, I'll just say from what I saw from the phase one and phase two, it was, for me, it wasn't the due diligence I would need to be comfortable moving ahead and it's just my analysis of it. So I do want to see what the actual, like what we'd actually be committing to and the type of due diligence. So I didn't see a plan in which the functions that happen in this building that serve our students could be rep would be replicated at a cost neutral basis. And that's what I would need to be able to see. Because I mean, I think, I believe that's what happened, but that's not what I saw in the phase one or phase two report and the answers to my questions. And I can only speak for myself because obviously I can't discuss what happened in the executive session.

start time: 2641:31:14.000
end time: 2644:23:14.000
confidence: 0.97
A: And I think all of that, those questions that you're raising are going to be addressed, I think in the due diligence work moving forward.

start time: 2644:26:02.000
end time: 2655:32:30.000
confidence: 0.96
G: That's right, and you are correct, Director Broom Edwards, but the reason that there was not a cost neutral finding in earlier stages is because the market did not look like this. And so those studies that were commissioned that took years had outdated information by the time that information was delivered. To you. Which is exactly why we're asking for action towards relocation with due diligence. That gets us to a transaction. Because then we won't be dealing in hypothetical scenarios. We'll be dealing with the market and variables as they exist today.

confidence: 0.96
B: I can get closer. Is that better? Okay. As Jonathan mentioned, we are gearing up for the 2024 short legislative session. The legislature will be convening from February 5th to March 10th. Our state, the state has a two year budget cycle. And so during this short session, the state will be meeting for 35 days to handle emergencies and to rebalance the state budget. As I've sent some materials to you all previewing some of the big issues that will be brought forth to the legislature. This session is going to mostly be focused on housing, housing production and behavioral health and addiction issues. The governor has put forth about a $600 million investment package that will cover housing production and rental assistance costs for Oregonians. She's also seeking funding for the employment related daycare program as well as $50 million in one time funding for summer learning. Given where we are in the two year budget cycle, there's not as much funding available at the state level until the state meets again in 2025 to approve the next two year budget for the biennium. So we're anticipating that there will be limited funding available for non housing related requests. So that's the context we're coming into as we prepare for the session. I'm bringing forward five priorities for you to review the this evening. And we will plan to approve the legislative agenda at the Feb. 6 meeting. The first three priorities are funding requests for the state. As I mentioned before, the governor is bringing forward a $50 million package for summer 2024 programs. As you've passed the budget for this year, we've already set aside funding for summer learning programs. This would allow PPS to get about 2.5 million more from the state and then we could redirect the funding we've already set aside for summer learning programs. It also gives us the opportunity to ask the state to really step in and make this a priority. This is one time funding for the only the one year. So we'll continue to advocate for the state to commit to this as an ongoing priority. Our second short session funding request is $22 million for early intervention and early childhood special education services. These are programs that provide required services to youth who are 0 to 5 during the pandemic. Referrals through this program plummeted because teachers and and physicians weren't able to see students in person to refer them to the program. And so the state has sort of a decreased number on which to develop the budget. So we're asking for this $22 million to shore up this program. And then our last funding request is $6 million for regional inclusive services. This is a program that works in collaboration with local school districts, early intervention, early childhood services, special ed programs, families and community agencies to provide specialized educational support for children who experience low incidence disabilities. An additional investment of $6 million will make sure that these programs are able to provide the full level of services and supports to students. And then our final two are policy priorities that don't that have minimal funding attached. The first is a youth collaborative that would be established at the state level. It's similar to our district student council. So it would give high school students across the state the opportunity to influence and learn about education policymaking. I know that our DSC is very supportive of this bill. I've gotten a lot of positive feedback from them. Then our last policy priority is to expand the community eligibility provision. So two things have happened in relation to this school nutrition services program. The state is now able to provide Medicaid certificate direct certification data to apply for this program. So as a result, we have more students now who are eligible for the CEP. And USDA passed a federal rule that increases the threshold from 25% to 40%. So district wide, right now we have about 33% of students who meet that CEP threshold. So if we were to get the state to recognize this rule, we would actually be able to implement CEP district wide, which would be great. And ODE has indicated that they do have a surplus of funding for cep. So we're not asking for an additional investment at this time. We would continue to make sure that they're fully funding that, but it would mean that we could serve breakfast and lunch to our students at all our schools. So really, really awesome priority. And those are the ones that I have recommended to you all. I know that you may have some additional success suggestions or questions for our agenda and welcome that.

end time: 2798:40:00.000
confidence: 0.97
A: And Lisa, before we open it up, I just want to make sure the board or this is clear. All legislative bills for the short session have already been written. So there isn't ability to submit a new bill.

start time: 2798:46:20.000
end time: 2804:35:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: That is correct. There. There are deadlines ahead of the session to for legislators to introduce bills. There are ways that we can amend bills or bring forward funding requests. But it is very challenging given the how close we are to the session starting.

start time: 2804:53:20.000
end time: 2805:27:52.000
confidence: 1.00
A: I have a quick question about the.

start time: 2805:28:16.000
end time: 2807:28:50.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Very top bullet, the 50 million in statewide funding. Is that for the entire state? And then PPS would get 2.5. Yes, that's good.

start time: 2807:29:20.000
end time: 2807:34:22.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Correct.

start time: 2807:35:26.000
end time: 2808:00:10.000
confidence: 1.00
B: 50 million for the state.

start time: 2809:05:10.000
end time: 2836:28:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: I have a proposed addition to the agenda to add and the language is around school funding and I'll read what I'm proposing and then provide the framing around it, which I've, I mean I've shared it with everybody already. An additional 5051 million in state school fund grant to PPS for 202425 to mitigate the reductions in the 202425 budget and the impact on teaching positions that classroom supports. And while there is a focus on housing, I think we also have an obligation to state what it is we need and they can choose not to fund it. There was a lot of discussion between legislators and the district about costs that they felt we should take on. And they also pointedly said that they gave us what we asked for. So I think we should ask for what we need and then they know what as they head into session and we head into our budget season, they'll know what we need in order to stop cuts. Because the other thing is often in the past we've had legislators ask us not to cut things and I think we should give them an opportunity not to have to come here and ask us not to cut things that they could have prevented they us from cutting if they gave us an appropriation.

start time: 2836:46:30.000
end time: 2870:43:50.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I am 100% in favor of that. I'm going to just because I think it's important to get it into the record. I'm not going to Read the entire thing. But the letter we received from 16 legislators during the strike. We were surprised to hear accusations that the Oregon Legislature did not adequately fund schools this past legislative session. They went on to talk about how they were excited to be able to fulfill the request of $10.3 billion that the superintendent asked for. And they knew and we knew, and everybody should know that the $10.3 billion ask was done because they told us not to ask for anything more. And the governor asked us not to ask for anything more. Legislative leadership asked us not to ask anymore. They said, the best you're going to get is $10.3 million. We asked for that. They turned around, threw it in our face. So Director Mehmed was being very diplomatic. I'm not going to be. I will. And I said at the time after that letter came out that we will never, ever again be in the position of not asking for everything we need. So, absolutely, we need to ask for this $51 million to avoid the cuts, because Director Bermudres is right, we are going to have to make significant cuts as a result of the strike settlement. And these same legislators who didn't fund us the first time, who told us to agree to it, are going to come back and say, why are you cutting these classroom spots? Why are you cutting these other things? So we need to go down and not, you know, don't bring me down, bring Director Brem Edwards, who can be more diplomatic, but to explain the need so that when they don't fund it, and I don't think there's a high likelihood that they will, but, you know, it would be nice if our parents mobilized and our teachers mobilized to go down and put some pressure on. But if it doesn't get funded because it's not a priority, we can turn around and point and say, well, you know, we gave you an opportunity to do exactly what, what you told us in this letter you want to do. So I think it's very important that we ask for everything we need always. And I want to be clear, when they say you're not going to get 51 million, maybe you can get 10. The request is 51 million always. And it's going to be QAM next cycle. And it's always going to be the maximum amount because they've shown us that they can't be trusted. And I'm still fiery about this.

C: So speaking on that, and I'm in total agreeance with my colleagues about that. When we talk about mobilization all the piece. Is there a way we can start mobilizing our communities and our families and things like that to go down. Excuse me. To advocate for the stuff for. For the things that we need as well. Is that something we can come up with? Form, you know, and I want to work on that if we can some way or shape or form to where we can actually have our people go down and advocate for what we need.

B: Thanks, Chair Hollins. That's a great question. I've been in touch with a number of people, PTA leaders and other parents who are really interested in advocating. I've been sharing some information. I do have an advocacy toolkit on our government relations page. So there are definitely ways that they can engage independently or as a pta. And I'll continue to share updates with those groups as well. But we can absolutely organize, you know, a more cohesive day of action. I think it's if. If that's something the board wants to do, we can coordinate with our parents. We can bring board directors down to the Capitol. Last year, we had a great student day of action with our district student council. That went really well. So it's definitely something we've done before and. And can continue to plan for. For this session and for the long session as well.

I'm definitely going to bring Director Scott down as well. That's okay. That's okay. We go get that damage together. But I want to make sure that we are seized on the opportunity to let them put their money where their mouth is.

F: So just maybe in the light of Chair Holland's comments, I do think it would be good for us to take our legislative agenda and share it with the delegation, like, as soon as possible. I know we have to vote. Maybe we could send them the. This is the draft that we're intending to pass next week. Just because every day that goes, we're getting closer to session. I know, like, for the county, we met with all of Multnomah county legislators and like, here's what our agenda is. And so they're really clear from, at least from the county, what the. What the agenda is. And I think we could go likewise, have a really strong statement collectively. But Sooner than rather than later. I also initially circulated another potential amendment. ABT has their 25 apparently a 25 million ask and we had talked about potentially adding a $500,000 ask for the due diligence. I don't know if there's an interest in adding it to the legislative agenda or having informal conversations about it.

confidence: 0.92
F: It's my understanding that they're AVT is going to be making. They have a significant financial loss for cap capital from, from the state and in our conversations and the recommendations from staff is that we need to do some due diligence. We don't have really any capital funds to pay that for. So we could make an accompanying ask if you're support if they are supporting the large capital contribution to abt that this would be allow us to actually facilitate the capital spend. And I circulate some language. I could read it.

E: Two quick things to ask about. One, I know with our, with our levy cap, we've had some conversations around strategy and I think the idea is that in the short session it's going to be very, very hard to get the levy cap raised. And I don't disagree with that analysis. I kind of want to come back though to the same conversation around funding. Are we. And we haven't decided as a board, we're going to have to decide pretty quickly, but it's going to kind of be simultaneous. Like are we going out for a renewal or are we going out for an increase? What are. Are we doing? Are we in danger at all though if we, if we don't, even if we don't think it's going to get passed if we don't put it on as an official ask, are we in danger of then, you know, having particularly if our community's frustrated that maybe we can't raise the levy and having the legislature come back and said you didn't ask us to raise this cap. And so I just again sort of in the spirit of this, is it worth throwing that on the agenda? Just as a hey, reminder, we asked this last year, last session, didn't get it. We're going to ask for it again in the short session and then if we don't get it, we'll be back in the long session, even if it's not something we put a lot of resources behind.

start time: 2967:25:40.000
end time: 2991:59:24.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah, thanks for the question, Director Scott. I've been having some conversations with legislators prior to the session. We even had a bill ready to go this session. And I think, like what you said, the landscape is not great for us passing a, a big enough increase to the cap that would really preserve our, our funding in the long term. So I think we want to really go back to the drawing board and look at other solutions that we can bring forward and work on collaboratively, collaboratively with the legislature to identify. So I think my concern is that we want to give ourselves a little more time to work on that policy and have, have longer term conversations with electeds about it. We can still request an informational hearing on the issue and continue to raise this as something they're going to have to address in the long term. There are a lot of conversations happening about the state of public education funding happening. There's a study bill that Senator Denbrough is introducing that's going to require the Legislative Policy and Research Office to study how the state funds the public education and look at the quality education model. And then there's the governor's work groups. So I think there's space in those areas where we can bring forward our issue and they can sort of look at the local option levy in conjunction with these other public education issues.

start time: 2992:00:52.000
end time: 3009:08:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: And I would just ask if we're not going to formally put it on, that we just again, as you said in these other ways bring. And then actually you touched on the second one. I just, I really, I want to make sure we're tracking very closely, particularly the QAM reform things. Denbrough made some comments publicly during the teacher strike about wanting to go back and revisit qam. And it wasn't in a positive way. It was in a let's revisit this so that we don't continue to get embarrassed as a legislature way. So I'm very concerned, I mean about, you know, the studies of that. Are there they really designed to sort of say, hey, what's truly qem? What would it take for a quality education? Or are they designed to take away what has become a political headache for the legislature? So I will just Appreciate for the board could get updates on that as it moves forward and really carefully parse that language, what they're looking for. And then my last issue, I would just say my understanding is there may be some bills introduced this short session around collective bargaining and collective bargaining for teachers. And I would appreciate if the board could just be kept in the loop on what those bills are and what they, what they, what they would do. We can have, if they are introduced, we can have a conversation about that.

start time: 3009:08:50.000
end time: 3017:00:10.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So, yeah, thanks, Director Scott. I'm happy to provide regular updates. I'm planning to provide weekly updates throughout the session as well as, you know, more frequent ones related to bills we might want to testify on or advocate more in depth on. So you can look out for more information. We are expecting to see the whole universe of short session bills made public available in the next couple weeks. So there will be a lot more information that I can share.

start time: 3017:57:10.000
end time: 3054:48:22.000
confidence: 0.95
F: I think there's one way to capture some of the issues you raise. And also the other issue I think that we should be visible on or have a point of view on is around the funding formula. And I mean, it looks like they're going to have some limited changes. I mean, at least the one on removing the percentage cap on students eligible for special education is a positive one. I do think we should flag just how we, how we set up our legislative agenda. They should be by categories and I think we should have a funding formula category so that as the conversation is moving on these issues that Lisa has the authority to like weigh in and advocate on things, but also so that we sort of put a stake in the ground. So I mean, this is a pretty limited list. I will say that, like the county had like six pages. This is a pretty limited list. And I think we could add something related to QEM that that's under the school funding and then also under the funding formula that our advocacy that like larger urban districts that have higher costs of doing business which aren't recognized get recognized. But then again, it's like putting a placeholder in the conversation. So it's not just like, oh, we're going to make these funding format changes and PPS doesn't have a point of view. It's like, yeah, we think there should be a larger conversation and we think there should be some other elements added or, or weighted in different ways to address some of our cost of doing business from being an area. So those would be. I don't know if you could come up with language, but it's more sharing our point of view, knowing that there's going to be a discussion about it without it being like we support this specific legislation. And I think you should come up with something on qem because I think they're going to come up with a study and I think we, we are going to want to have a point of view of something more than a point of view of what the study outcome will be. And that's something that will be for debate because they may be like we're going to study QAM and we can advocate for here's what we think as you're studying it, that you should look.

F: Yeah, yeah, exactly. But I think that could beef it up a little bit and we could also have placeholders that we set aside up for the the next legislative session when they're probably going to go deep on those issues.

B: Thank you, Director Bermer. I'm happy to circulate some language to the board before our next meeting for you all to review. And you know, I think that's a great point. There's a lot of other policies we can weigh in on throughout the session.

end time: 3076:09:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Sure. Chair Holland so based on prior board discussions, the next general obligation bond is anticipated to be presented to voters this upcoming November 2024. In order to refer a GO bond package or an obligation a general obligation bond package, the district must determine the.

start time: 3076:09:50.000

D: Amount of the GO bond, the financial.

start time: 3076:48:46.000
end time: 3153:36:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Plan and the scope of projects. A GO bond referral must be made no later than mid August. With high level direction, staff would will work further scope refinement review. But with a high level direction, staff will work further to scope out refinement review, review this with the Bond Accountability Committee and of course get critical community input. So we hope that tonight we can begin to get a sense of the board's priorities and parameters. We know that preparing a bond package is very common, complex and that we need to move quickly to be sure we have a thorough and thoughtful process by this summer. So with that, I'm turning it over to our coo, Dan Young. Thank you. I was going to say some of those things, so I know we're running a little behind schedule. So my hope is to jump right into the meat of this topic and make our discussion as conversational as possible. As I mentioned before, it's a broad topic and there's no like one obvious kind of entry point into it. So I don't want to talk too much tonight, rather just we'll do a quick overview and then get into your questions and thoughts and comments. As you know, staff have been preparing for a potential general obligation bond vote in November of 2024. In your packets meeting packets tonight, there are four documents that I believe everyone has had some time to review. There's a staff report that attempts to provide some background and context to bond planning consultants, conceptual bond scope of work and high level cost ranges. Sample bond Finance Financing options There are more. That is just a handful of them. It's not an exhaustive list. That's a large topic in and of itself and a document with four sample bond packages that includes some pros and cons for each. As Jonathan noted, tonight's goal is to get board feedback on the primary bond development question. What is the right bond principal amount, how should the bond be financed and what projects should be included? So our hope is that the Board can provide some guidance and general direction on each of these topics so we can then further refine the information and the options and return to the Board with additional detail for further discussion. I will also note that there's a fourth important question is that answering or confirming that November 2024 is the right, right time to request a general obligation bond from voters. I will note tonight we have some folks that can help answer some of the Board's questions, including the Piper Sandler team, which is PPS's financial advisors. Carol and David are here and Lauren might be online. Maybe not. She's in different time zone. She might be in bed as well as various staff as well. A couple real quick important takeaways though. There are many PPS's capital needs are very big. The district has over 100 buildings over 9 million square feet. About 2/3 of the facilities are considered in poor or critical condition and the deferred maintenance backlog exceeds $1 billion. That number does not include planned capital renewal facility improvements such as at least athletics, seismic upgrades, ADA improvements or the ERP implementation. Nor does it include costs of modernization projects such as Jefferson, Cleveland Wells or Tubman and others. So the needs are big. There's the summary regarding financing. There are a lot of different potential financing options, but all come with trade offs. Tonight's materials include that financing matrix that attempts to highlight some of the dependencies between variables such as levy rate, interest costs, duration of the debt, and then the impacts to future bond revenue capacity. Understanding those options, those trade offs are important part of bond planning. With that, I'll pause and ask if there are any initial questions or thoughts. Okay. Hearing none. The goal tonight is to get some people. I'm coming to the end, but I do have some prompts in case we got here. Here's. We'll try some of these problems. So regarding scope of work, we can start there. When you look at the sample projects or the sample options, is there any projects or scopes of work that. That jump out to you is like that should definitely be in or that should definitely be out? I think there's some that we've heard, but it'd be good to hear from the board in this context.

start time: 3155:42:56.000
end time: 3157:03:12.000
confidence: 0.98
A: So those are two different. Correct. And there's also this one where it says conceptual budgets.

start time: 3157:19:28.000
end time: 3160:04:02.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And down the left side is. Is kind of categorized different potential scopes of work. And then there's a cost range. I know there's a lot of documents. There's a lot of footnotes and everything else.

start time: 3160:05:06.000
end time: 3160:54:10.000
confidence: 0.98

start time: 3160:55:30.000
end time: 3164:04:30.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Right. And then the sample bond options document looks to provide some sample groupings and then kind of highlight the pros and cons of those.

start time: 3165:45:40.000
end time: 3172:08:40.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Decarbonization. It just has a tbd, I thought, and I guess it's tbd. So maybe this is what it is. But when we're for example, doing modernizations that like part of the decarbonization is the new building is more carbon neutral or has less carbon. Is. Is that what you're thinking or are you thinking other.

start time: 3172:36:30.000
end time: 3174:40:22.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah, it's a great question because you know, the documents make looks like everything like fits perfectly into a category. And it's not quite that simple.

start time: 3174:41:26.000
end time: 3176:01:26.000
confidence: 0.91
F: It's kind of like seismic because it's like, okay, the biggest size projects we do are the modernizations.

start time: 3176:03:18.000
end time: 3188:15:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Exactly. So with some scopes of work like modernizations, they're going to have a decarbonization component to it. Roofs are going to have, you know, they're going to increase energy efficiency. Those are going to have a decarbonization component to it. It. So there definitely is overlap. And we like projects that check multiple boxes. That line item is there is. We're currently developing a decarbonization plan that is specific to the climate crisis response policy and the goals, the 2030-2040 goals. It will likely have some scope of work that doesn't fit into other categories. An example might be that I don't know yet is like adding significant solar. Right. And so that would be something that we would Put into this category, if that makes sense.

A: Right. So is there anything in there? And, and the samples have, you know, some components as well and the memo is long. But. But are there for example specific modernization projects that you would think certainly should be in there or are there other scopes of work that you might say, considering we know we can't take care of everything in one bike. Deprioritize another scope of work?

F: So you know, if possible we could go for the higher bond. Then you can do both. But then we have to raise our taxes, which probably people don't want. So. Or do the long range one. No, the long range one doesn't even do that. Anyway, there's no right answer. But I think we do have to.

Principal amount that retains the current levy rate and the projects within it. So that generates it looks like, well, 1.5 billion enough revenue.

F: Well, it's B1 on the sample bond finds. So I'm looking at raising enough money, retaining the levy rate and raising enough money. So I'll give you my sort of categories that I'm interested in. Absolutely. The last two high schools, that's been a promise to the community. The ADA work since we're 50 years plus years since it passed. So the continuation of that work that we started last time would give you an. It would give staff an increment, not an insignificant amount. But for money for deferred maintenance and then erp. And whatever the next phase of the ERP work and also the Tubman project. And I think you could do that within the 1.5 billion. The trade off may be that you. It says potential Next Bond 2040, which is significantly further out. But what I would like to offer to other people, because if you look at, oh, if we increase the levy rate, we actually could, you know, do more projects. But just because we go out for a bond and have retain the rate and raise a significant amount of money, doesn't mean we have to wait to 2040. If we did decide. Well, if the future board decided they wanted to go out and raise another increment of money, you could always choose the option of raising the rates. So that, that's where just my first sort of take on where I would be as a priority standpoint.

end time: 3342:18:10.000
confidence: 0.96
F: To allow you to pursue additional capital projects into the future. This graph goes all the way out to 2049, I believe, which means that you have a lot of capacity after this next year to levy additional taxes for additional indebtedness. How you choose to fill those steps really gets back to what Dan was saying of trade offs between getting significant amounts now which will fill in those drops to a lesser or greater degree, or waiting or some balance between those 2.

end time: 3356:09:30.000

F: To fill the next drop. So rather than having drops every four years, which is what this graph indicates, it would give you a longer period of time which allows you to raise more money right now.

start time: 3356:23:50.000
end time: 3377:16:20.000
confidence: 0.95
E: And thank you. And so it's helpful because. And we're also talking about different lengths of debt. And again just, I mean we know this, but those different lengths of debt, obviously the faster you pay it off, the less interest you pay and the longer you pay it off, the more. And so just to compare B1 which raises $1.5 billion, but as $575 million of interest, it's 20 year debt. And with a 16 year drop meaning and what that just so I make sure I understand, I'm following. So we're going to issue 20 year bonds and then 16 years later, about 2040, like you just said, there's a drop and we could go out again. If you go all the way down to D1, this also raises $1.5 billion but we'd be issuing 24 year debt. So longer debt, significantly more interest rate, $950 million of interest versus 575. But you would be able to go back out earlier in 2032. And why is that? If you're is the reason. So you're issuing longer debt, but it's in order to create that eight year drop, does that mean you're structuring it to pay more of it off up front? No, it must mean the opposite.

start time: 3377:17:40.000
end time: 3377:37:24.000
confidence: 0.90

end time: 3381:29:56.000

start time: 3390:12:30.000
end time: 3392:32:10.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Right. Let me ask a different way. Are all of the debt issuances the level debt over the term of the debt, or do you think of structuring some of them.

end time: 3393:50:10.000

G: Terminology.

start time: 3393:58:30.000
end time: 3396:09:12.000
confidence: 0.94
F: When we refer to a level levy, what we're talking about is a levy rate.

end time: 3396:47:36.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I'm actually asking about the bonds you're issuing.

G: Correct.

end time: 3406:38:28.000
confidence: 0.95
F: I just want to make sure we're talking the same language. Level debt in our world means having annual debt service, principal and interest payments that is structured like your mortgage, where the dollars would be the same every year because we have assessed value that grows over time. If you issue true level debt, you would actually see a levy rate that declines. Is that what you meant?

start time: 3406:41:24.000
end time: 3406:48:52.000

B: Yeah.

start time: 3406:49:56.000
end time: 3408:04:20.000
confidence: 0.93

start time: 3408:05:40.000
end time: 3408:43:56.000
confidence: 0.93

G: Based upon the levy rate maximum that you are comfortable estimating, assume some period.

start time: 3411:24:20.000
end time: 3412:26:40.000

F: Of level levy, not level debt.

start time: 3412:56:20.000
end time: 3423:33:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Let me try one more time because I feel like I maybe I'm not as good when we're issued. I mean, when we issue the bonds, right, we, we have a choice. Do we issue them at sort of we're going to make the same principle and interest payment for the next 20 years. We also could say we're going to do interest only payments for the first five or ten years. Not recommended, but you could do that with sort of huge escalating payments at the end. Or you could do a really aggressive payment up front. Right. That sort of decreases over time. I was just curious, are all of these using the same assumptions or do you also play a little bit with the way you structure the debt repayment, which again, sometimes pays it off later, sometimes pays it off sooner.

start time: 3423:39:20.000
end time: 3423:53:20.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Got it.

start time: 3423:55:20.000
end time: 3428:10:40.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Okay. All of these built in the same set of assumptions about repayment of debt in accordance with an assumed growth rate in your assessed value of 3% per year.

start time: 3428:11:20.000
end time: 3444:15:04.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Okay, great. And then last question is a little bit more meta about sort of best practice because I've been as I'm looking through these scenarios, governments tend not to issue debt over 20 years. We can, we don't like to. There are different principles around this. And on the one hand, interest rates go up the longer the debt. And I was actually surprised to learn when I got here that most of our debt from the previous bonds 2013, 2017 was shorter term debt much shorter than the life of the asset. And that I believe the 2020 bonds were longer. Like were they 20 year bonds that we sold for 2020, but they were longer than what we had done in the past. I don't need to know the specifics. My question is more sort of principally like the reason you issue debt that matches the life or doesn't exceed the life of your asset. But if you have a, if you're building a 50 year building, it's perfectly appropriate to do 20 year debt because of it generational of equity.

start time: 3444:15:52.000
end time: 3444:18:32.000
confidence: 0.82
B: Right.

start time: 3444:18:56.000
end time: 3455:54:30.000
confidence: 0.98
E: And you're spreading the cost of that out to the people who are going to benefit from it. But it also seems to be restricting like our flexibility around, you know, because it's taking longer to pay off. And so we've essentially that other graph you had, we've stacked so much up that 2013, 17, 2020, if we go out with a 2024 bond at $1.5 million, we might just be sitting on that for the next 16 years. And I'm just, I guess the question I'm asking is from a best practice perspective, should we be trying to pay this debt off more quickly, issuing shorter term debt, is it fine to be doing this? Are there things we should be doing differently in terms of the structuring?

start time: 3456:37:30.000
end time: 3458:30:00.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Okay, a lot of questions there. So let me see if I can unpack that.

E: I'll finish in 60 seconds. The high schools are an absolute must have for me. It's a promise we made to the district and I just. Those communities will abandon us if we abandon them. So that is just something. And I'm honest, I don't think we'll be able to pass a bond if we don't. And I will campaign against it if we don't include the finishing up the high schools. So just wanted, I'm only one board member but I want to make it clear where I am on that. And I think, you know, I think what I, what I, we need to make a decision about where we go for this. What I also want to see is a long term, and I say long term, I mean 20 or 30 years. What we saw coming out of the strike was, you know, and what we're seeing now with our fragile, you know, infrastructure that, you know, crumbles with some ice is, you know, this disinvestment for decades. And we have started this great process and I want to be part of a board that continues it and whether that means, you know, increases for eight years from now. But we need to, we need to figure out how we replace all of our infrastructure and modernize all of our infrastructure. And it's going to take decades. But when we say decades, decades go by faster than we think. Right. And when we don't do anything, we find ourselves decades down the road without having done anything. So this next bond is really important. What comes after that's really important too. And I would love to see what's that plan for moving on to the middle schools and moving on to the great elementary schools. Even if it's a 50 year plan. Metro does some 50 year visioning, the school board can do some 50 year visioning as well and figure out finishing high schools, moving on, doing all the other. I totally agree with some of the ADA and safety stuff as well. So.

end time: 3630:14:20.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Okay, I guess I'll go next. I'm looking at either B1 or B2, of course, I think I'm looking at the, the 1.5. I wish it could be 5, 5 billion. I made that recommendation, but I guess no one took me up on that. When I look at some of the modernizations and I understand the passion for some of the high schools, for all the high schools to get done, but when I look at situations like that we have right now where we have elementary schools that's going to be down for 30 days, middle schools that's going to be down for 30 days is doing both high schools right now. Where we at as a need for our school district now rather than looking at those because like for instance, if we have this storm another five years, well, we might have two high Schools. But then those same middle schools have this same issue or problem because we prioritize in our high schools. So I just think, I think we should take another look at, at that. As far as, you know, what our, what are our real needs is versus, you know, I'm not, I'm not going to say wants, but you know, when we look at our, our kids and what do they need right now? Do our do, like for instance, do Markham need a new Ida B. Wells? Do you know, our middle school need a new Ida B. Wells right now? So I would just kind of look at that. If we can look at those schools that are, that can harm our kids right now. Not that you can't come back and do the high school. Some of the high schools are later. So just a thought. I am. And I'm just, I'm kind of confused. So when we look at sample 1, 2, 3 and 4, those are ones that are correlated to the 1.5. So like sample 4 correlated to 1.5. I'm looking at the conceptual bond budgets.

start time: 3630:24:00.000
end time: 3633:53:28.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Yeah. If you look at the bottom bolded row, there's the total dollar amount. So sample 1 and 2, total 850 million samples 3 and 4.1.

start time: 3633:54:24.000
end time: 3633:59:52.000
confidence: 0.57
B: Okay.

start time: 3634:00:56.000
end time: 3643:35:44.000
confidence: 0.95
A: And just FYI on those numbers, the 850 million first came from when we were talking about financing options, we asked a, I guess a two like, like if we did 12 years at leverage, what would that number be? Roughly $850 million. So we matched a couple samples to that number and then we said, well, let's give a bigger option. The 1.5 is just a bigger option. I wouldn't focus too much on that. I think the feedback would be good here is kind of smaller versus bigger or super big. If there's a $5 billion desire out there, but not too much on the exact jumbo.

start time: 3643:38:02.000
end time: 3649:04:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: The jumbo. When I look at the facilities improvements, deferred maintenance on those, is that 700 million to 1 billion. And how much of that has been done in the previous bonds?

start time: 3649:23:40.000
end time: 3671:51:36.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So the 700 million to 1 billion is the district completed a facility condition assessment a few years ago and that looked at not all scopes of work, but a lot of critical building scopes of work. And it's high level rapid visual inspection. We estimate current to up to current with work that's already been completed is it would take about $700 million over the next 10 years to address all of the deferred maintenance items that were identified back in 2020. Excuse me, it'd be a billion dollars to address all of them. 700 million. If we spent that much, that would take the overall district condition from FCI facility condition index, which is just a ratio from poor to fair. That is just. Deferred maintenance noted in 2020 does not include additional capital renewal. Any other, such as any other maintenance that has gone into the critical state over the last three or four years or just annual capital renewal needs. So those are additive. We don't have hard numbers on that. The memo talks about. Those are also big numbers. But we realize at some point in time the numbers are so big we're not putting too much more analysis into it.

end time: 3680:48:38.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Outdoor spaces for here are like play spaces, covered play structures, playgrounds, deep haven parking lots, those sort of things. Whereas athletics is specific to the athletic fields or the athletic. Outdoor athletics.

C: Well, I just didn't know what the. It's really a hard time. I just don't feel what's the difference. And I hear the ERP is something that we really need to do. So I would be in, I would want that in there. That's, I think that's kind of where my, my priorities are. I wasn't here to make promises to the community. I don't think boards should be making promises for future boards to have to uphold. That's just my own personal thoughts. So I'm not. Like I said, I'm not. If we can look at some of our most neediest schools, I'm okay with, you know, maybe doing one high school.

start time: 3696:40:50.000

C: Yeah, middle school, elementary school. Well, we got them whether we want to believe it or not. I guess I just look at what's happening right now and look like, you know, we got great high schools, but then how did I help our kids that mark them right now?

start time: 3702:29:16.000
end time: 3702:58:44.000

E: I need to say on behalf of particularly my zone, Ida B. Wells, I mean these, these communities have waited. They have waited and they have funded these bonds, they have supported these bonds. What we did, Roosevelt, what we did, Lincoln, what we did, Grant, what we've now are doing, Jefferson. And they funded and waited. And so honestly going back and saying, hey, you've waited a decade and we kept telling you, but it's a new board and new people. And so we're changing our minds. Those people will actively oppose the next bond because again, we weren't here. There's nobody bound this board to make the promise. But that doesn't mean that, that, you know, promise wasn't made. And so we need to make a decision. Do we uphold that promise or do we change course? And then there are real consequences from changing course.

start time: 3716:51:44.000
end time: 3718:18:16.000
confidence: 0.93

end time: 3728:43:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: That's just where I'm at. You know, I'm just looking at our needs versus our wants. I know we want to do our high schools, but our kids might need something else. And I just don't want us to just focus on the wants versus and overlook the needs that might happen. Even though, yes, there was promises made that they would get their high schools. You know, if I need a heart transplant versus one to redo my nose. Yeah, I might want to redo my nose and it's great. And I made a promise to myself to make my nose.

A: I do have a quick question in terms of deferred maintenance, you know, that's kind of where my, A lot of my concerns are because deferred maintenance just gets more expensive the more you defer it. Right. Part of the. How much of it. Of this deferred maintenance may be wiped out. I mean, if we're Talking about a 50 year plan, you know, in terms of like, in terms of scope of the order of operations.

end time: 4227:24:30.000
confidence: 0.94
A: We were getting our high schools first because they serve our largest populations. And that wipes, hopefully wipes out temporarily some of the deferred maintenance. Right. But as we move down to middle school, elementary school, does, does some of that, I mean, has that, I guess, has that been factored into some of the cost estimates or in terms of like, you know, pros and cons? In terms of, I guess it's late and I've been driving all day, so my work's not good right now. So I'm sorry, but I don't know if that came out cross so clear. Yeah, I think so certainly when we do modernization work, you know, if we replace the school, that takes care of that deferred maintenance and the more modernization work that you can get to that chips away at the deferred maintenance. Just something that I'll kind of leave the script but like let's say we were able to modernize all the district in 10 years or whatever, the district is going to want to get to a place. And I think this is where Director Scott's kind of 50 year plan is of, of not just addressing deferred maintenance, hopefully that's a small number, but actual having funds set aside for capital renewal. So you're actually planning. Right now we're largely deferred maintenance is fixing broken things we want in things that have been broken for a long time. When you, you have the deferred maintenance that the district has. We'd like to get into a path where we're modernizing, we're addressing the deferred maintenance and then we're actually setting capital side for capital renewal and planning for those things before they become critical building systems and we have, you know, plumbing failures, electrical system failures, et cetera. Oh yeah, great, thank you.

E: So I mean the presidential election year traditionally has been the time it's a favorable electorate, it's a little bit easier of a campaign to run. It also gets frankly it's a little bit further down the ballot. So I think there's real advantages there. So I would like to keep it there with the caveat of I think seeing what happens with our levy in May will be key. And if something weird and shocking happens with our levy in May, we may need to rethink November. But I mean it's tough to run two campaigns in a year. But I also feel like if we put it off, I'm confident in you we've got the danger of putting it off and going in a May election or a November off year election, which gets more challenging.
