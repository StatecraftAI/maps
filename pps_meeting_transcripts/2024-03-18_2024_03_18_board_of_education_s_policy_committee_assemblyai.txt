A: Okay, I think we're ready to start Policy committee meeting of March 18th. I'm going to start the way we happen to be in this room. Not for any particular reason other than the other rooms aren't available. I'm just saying that. Not because it's something different or the content of the meeting, but also, I guess so it's easier to hear the tape. So I'm going to start the meeting the way that we always start committee meetings, not necessarily the way that we start our board meetings with. And I'm just going to go the front row. Roseanne, can you start with just introductions?

I'm the student representative. Is that just me or could you hear Frankie, can you speak up a little bit? Can't hear you. Yeah, let me get closer to my computer. Hi, I'm Frankie Silverstein and I'm the student representative. Great. That's much, much better. Anything we can do to. Okay, so we're going to start today with public comment. And then we have three policies on today's agenda. And then also we have noting that we have one policy that has been referred to a first reading but hasn't yet had its first reading, but will on April 2nd, and that's the diploma requirements. So with that, Roseanne, do we have people signed up for public comment?

F: Okay. My name is John Greshow and I work with the War Resistors League here in Portland. The United States is a very militarized country. Our government spends well over half of its annual budget on all things military. By contrast, it spends roughly 3 to 5% of the budget on education. The US has approximately 800 military bases all over the planet. And a might makes right foreign policy, which supports regular bombings and drone strikes in the name of an extralegal war on terror. Many of our citizens have a romanticized view of the military and of war. And our public schools are more militarized than in most developed nations because of Pentagon programs such as JROTC, starbase and military recruiter access promoted by Congress and Tied to federal funding. The US Is a country plagued by violence, with mass shootings happening day after day and year after year, as I'm sure you're well aware. Yet we refuse to take the steps necessary to stop the violence. JROTC only contributes to this excessive militarism and violence which I'm describing. Picture kids walking high school hallways in military uniform, doing military drill on the school athletic fields, honing their skills at the in school firing range. I don't know about you, but I find these images very disturbing and very un. Portland.

C: And we have two kids still remaining at Fabian in third and fifth grade. We're proud to say that we've been in the Fabian community for over a decade. Fabian is a Pre K through 8th grade school nestled in the northeast neighborhood near the old Concordia University, now University of Oregon. We have the largest boundary of any PPS elementary school with kiddos attending our school from as far as Hayden Meadows Island. And we have seven buses that bring kids into our school community. Sometimes the kids who ride these buses are sitting in traffic for over an hour each way. Our school is a Title 1 school. 80% of our kids qualify for free or reduced lunch, 30% speak English as a second language, and our school's minority enrollment is 75%. We value and celebrate the diversity and rich culture within our community. And our principal, Dr. Williams, along with her dedicated staff, pour their hearts into serving our kiddos every day. Unfortunately, despite dedicated staff efforts, our kids are falling behind. At Fabian, only 10% of our kiddos scored at or above the proficient level of math, and 26% scored at or above the proficient level of reading. The kids at our school, they need support. Like I mentioned, my family has been a part of this community for over 10 years and now more than ever, they need support. We need counselors, we need. We need trauma support, we need ESL support. And we. We just got notification that nine of our full time staff will be cut next year. Which is why I urge you to please consider reforming the foundation funding so that we can have equitable funding for all schools and not just the schools that have the money for the extra funding and to make the extra money on that. Thanks.

G: My name is Melissa Blount. B L O U N T I'm a PPS parent and I've been the librarian at George Middle school, a Title 1 school in North Portland for seven years. Our student demographics are 51% direct certification and only 23% of our students met reading benchmarks last spring. Spring compared to another PPS school with a robust foundation with only 7% direct certification where 78% of students met benchmark, that school's foundation said they need to fundraise to make their library services whole. I am being reduced to halftime. The George Library will be closed half the week or more next year. As things stand currently, I may also have to discontinue our after school OBOD program. A library isn't just a book, a room with books. It's a classroom and a community space. Without adequate staffing, our students lose access to that learning environment and all of the tools that come with teacher librarians and library assistants. Please hear me loud and clear. When PPS makes significant budget cuts, as it has many, many times since the passage of Measure 5, no school is left unscathed. We all feel it and my students and others at low SES schools feel it the most. If parents in a wealthy community are able to insert their private money fund a full time librarian, what do those parents know or care about? The vast majority of PPS schools that cannot, who are in less of a position of privilege to advocate for their kids and whose schools also face cuts of necessary positions? Please do not wonder why more people from my school community have not come out to speak about something so complex and that has been hidden from them for decades. Those parents also have unique challenges that many PPS families do not. I am here today for my community. But please don't discount the many other voices from schools spanning all SES statuses that have come before me for so many years and ask you to reform this policy. This reform effort is not about guaranteeing that a certain amount will be privately raised. It is about the spirit of policy to guide citizens to act equitably, communally and not solely in their own self interest. It is about updating an outdated policy. Thank you for your time.

A: Thank you. Is that all Rosanna's at all? Okay. Great coming and sharing your perspectives today with us. We are and I would just ask so just our normal Even though we're in the boardroom, our normal process is people have a chance to comment in our committee meetings, during the public comment and then the rest of the discussion is for staff and board members I just want to make that clear unless specifically somebody asks a question. But. Okay, so we're going to start on the policy. 7.1 0.020 the district it was the individual school or program fundraising. It's now the district wide advocacy and fundraising policy. And the materials that we have for this meeting we have one title of funding of school based staff that just kind of gives the current state and then an options menu that we've been through in previous meetings. We also have a June 17, 2022 memo that covers the. There's been numerous community engagement but this particular involves two roundtables that were held and then also a principal survey that happened. So that information is posted as well. In addition, there was discussion at the last meeting around this document that we called a matrix. And this was in some ways a response to some of your questions Director Sylvan about what the other models were and how they distributed money. And in some ways I think it was primarily focused on how they distributed the money. But in some ways we've resolved that by. It's going to be decided. It will be decided but before the school year in which the fundraising happens. So it's not decided in the policy.

start time: 208:58:30.000
end time: 209:35:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So decided by whom?

start time: 209:54:30.000
end time: 221:24:20.000
confidence: 0.92
A: If you look at. Let me just find a. Okay. One thing we meant to put. I meant to put numbers in to make it easier, but I didn't. Let's see, it is in. It'd be the third paragraph, not counting the first leave paragraph. Fundraising for staff and contracted so it's formula for the funding to school should be developed in advance of the school year. So again people know before they start fundraising by a parent advisory committee shared to school administrators for feedback and recommendation to the board of education for its approval.

start time: 221:51:20.000
end time: 222:57:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So decided every year in advance of the fundraising.

start time: 224:36:40.000
end time: 279:09:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: And so I'm going to just cover off just the differences between the matrix you saw last time and. And this one just for the record. So the main takeaways from the matrix just looking at other larger districts or districts in the region is PPS is the only district that allows individual school communities to fund staff positions at a particular school. It also notes some of these other districts that have where they have extra funding besides just the state school fund, whether they have a local option, a bond, just so you can get a sense of what are the resources available. Obviously we all know that Portland has a local option, a school bond and art tax. And then it also lays out just the number of students enrolled, the median household income. So I want to call attention to two things we took out the column that was titled per student fundraising because it was hard to get an accurate comparison of what actually per student went to staffing. So we just. It wasn't the point of the matrix. The real point of the matrix was to just is really probably the right hand column to talk which lays out what other districts do. So like PPS allows individual fundraising at individual schools. Lagos Lego for example, they raise money district wide for FTE and every school benefits. But it's not. You can't raise it for this particular school. You know, Hillsboro doesn't allow. Their foundation, does not fund school based staff. Westland Wilsonville. So I'm going to talk a little bit about Westernville. I'm sorry, not Westland Wilsonville, Tiger Tualton. So last meeting there was a discussion about the amount of money they had which was in their this reported which is $2.7 million. It's important to note that and I want to thank Robin and then I also had a conversation with Tom Tiger Tualatin School district is the majority of that $2 million is a. It appears to be an in kind contribution around food. They do raise money as a district wide foundation for. To pay for fte. But essentially all the schools in Tiger Tarleton get the same amount. So the amount they raise, they're called their school grants. It's the same for every school no matter what the level is. There's one school that gets slightly less and it sounds like it's a new school. So the vast majority, as you can see, get an increment that they can use for FTE and they specifically raise for that purpose. But it would be misleading or not accurate to say that the 2.7 is available for staffing because it's not for staffing.

start time: 279:14:40.000
end time: 283:02:16.000
confidence: 0.96
B: It's kind of strange the way it's stated. Every school in the district gets the same amount of FTE based on how much is raised. Raised by each school or raised total.

start time: 283:03:28.000
end time: 284:26:48.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Raised total. So it all goes into a central pot and then they divide it by the number of schools.

start time: 284:29:44.000
end time: 286:41:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Okay. So seems like they shouldn't have to say based on how much is raised. Just kind of is weird.

start time: 286:50:00.000
end time: 307:07:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Okay. You know Patti, you're made for this committee because we've always had editors and I'm not one of them. It's the Greek tradition of Rita Moore and Ailey Lowry. So we can make that correction. But essentially it's the same whatever amount they raise. Yes, exactly. Like I say, there's just one exception. It sounds. Yes, exactly. Oh, I can see what you're. I got it. Yes, we'll correct that. So that's one correction I need to make. And then I want to also note that for the fund for Portland schools, the total for the. So that we have roughly an apples to apples, which is what we were trying to do, that the amount for equity grants and district wide initiatives is 1.3 million, not the lower amount because just as we're counting carry forwards for other districts because that's allowed on the 990s, which is the basis for a lot of the information that includes the carryover for pps.

start time: 307:43:20.000
end time: 312:54:18.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I'm thinking another thing that would be interesting would be, you know, what's your lowest amount that a school raises and the highest amount or their incomes. Is there a broad range in those districts of schools or they're all pretty much the same, any amount they could raise?

start time: 312:55:54.000
end time: 316:04:04.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, I mean it's a good question. I'll see if I can find it. Because they raise it district wide. I'm not sure it's people's donations are attached to their individual school. School.

start time: 316:06:52.000
end time: 318:58:28.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Well they probably aren't but it gives you a good idea of if you distribute it equally. Well let's see, let me see.

start time: 319:00:44.000
end time: 320:08:36.000
confidence: 0.86
A: Because it's all coming into one pot.

start time: 320:09:48.000
end time: 323:43:30.000
confidence: 0.92
B: And so say one school. So going to one pot but one school raises 50,000, the other school raises 2,000 and then it's distributed equal.

start time: 323:49:10.000
end time: 324:54:50.000
confidence: 0.97
A: It's their central foundation raises the money.

start time: 325:05:10.000
end time: 326:09:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Okay, so you don't know at all what it came from each school?

start time: 326:25:10.000
end time: 332:31:00.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I can check but my guess is for example looks like Michelle Hillsborough or Beaverton. So Beaverton, they don't use it to pay for staff but like they raise money district wide and they have these telethons like that basically when the fund calls. And so it's not necessarily based on here's the chunk of money that comes from.

start time: 332:48:00.000
end time: 333:15:40.000
confidence: 0.72
B: It's all individuals.

start time: 335:17:04.000
end time: 336:40:20.000
confidence: 0.89
D: Okay, that's a good question. I think that's what the median income is shown though, isn't it?

start time: 337:04:00.000
end time: 342:42:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, I mean some of these districts, you see Portland Falls at the lower end of the metro ones. But definitely, I mean, I guess, I think if you put some of the other districts in the state we'd in the middle or the upper.

start time: 343:41:40.000
end time: 345:48:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: And then at least the one it said it's distributed equally to each district school. We don't know about all the schools, how they do it.

start time: 345:55:10.000
end time: 360:31:38.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Well that's Tiger Tualatin and then Lake Oswego. Every school benefits, but they, and they don't allow. You can't raise money. And like I wanted to go to this specific school, but frankly most of the other foundations don't pay for fte. They pay for usually like school based grants versus specifically paying for fte. I mean I'm pretty familiar with the Hillsborough and the Beaverton models just from my time working in Washington county and contributing. And their foundation raises money from local businesses into the district wide foundation and then distributed generally through grants that people.

end time: 439:33:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Okay, so that's that chart. Robin, did you have anything you wanted to add? Okay. Okay, so there's been a lot of discussion over the last six years about this and we have two options. The last several meetings I tried to create a second option which was more like this year when we had some extra money and that leveled things off. But I'm going to ask today that we move forward with option one, which I'm just going to walk through the key components. First, sets up an inclusive district wide foundation designated by the Board of Education that will serve as the district wide advocacy and fundraising entity. So very much similar to the Portland Schools foundation. When it was started that it had a large advocacy component, it was right after measure five. And then second, that effective July 1, 2024, donations for staff positions may be collected only by a designated district wide foundation and a single combined fund account. What that means is all the funds that were raised that have been raised this year for staff for next year in, in theory and I think in practice by June 30, they have to pay for next year's funds. So next year there still would be foundation paid for staff, but starting July 1st of this year, the fundraising. So essentially last year's fund, this year's fundraising will play out into next year. So this is really starting the fundraise, starting the fundraising cycle on July 1st. But we will still, when you look at next year's staffing allocations, see schools that have FTE paid for with foundation staff because of the reforms that happened, that they now have to pay for the staff by the June 30th. Correct. And then the section also talks about the point, Patti, that we talked about earlier, that there's a formula and how that's set up and when it's set up so that people know in advance how it's going to be distributed. And I think it's, you know, it could be contemplated that you could have a multi year formula set if they want, if they wanted to and then there are some. There's some language that's in parentheses. And we had a discussion with staff about whether this should be in the policy or it should be in the resolution. But we left for right now we leave it in the policy just to be absolutely crystal clear. And it's this point that funds that are currently raised the expectation is that they can be expended in the 24, 25 and just so nobody thinks all of a sudden there's this cliff or they raised a lot of money and now they can't use it like because they were relying on the existing policy. But technically it probably better not to have it in the policy. It should more likely be in the resolution. But really want to be. Don't want anybody to think like all of a sudden like the money they raised isn't going to be used. There's also then a registration reporting and this move from an option two there's a requirement. This is more of an encourage model. And the reason why it's no longer a requirement is that they're no longer able in this new model able to buy staff. And so we encourage them to register with their contact information. Ideally, if we think about wanting to have a robust district wide advocacy.

confidence: 0.95
A: Be the district wide foundation is like the convening place for both advocacy but also fundraising and that they'd want to be part of that network of advocacy as a district. And then we'll receive an annual report at the end of the district's fiscal year showing this foundation's donations, expenditures and major projects which we currently get from the fund. And then the points about the entities that the other requirements these haven't changed since we discussed them at previous committee meetings. And these were ones many of them that came originally from the fund as recommendations how to make our fundraising activities more inclusive versus exclusive. There's some other provisions around just sort of threshold for contracted staff and what their requirement is. There is an addition that says in extraordinary circumstances the superintendent in consultation with the Board of Education may accept community based donations to fund staff. And we don't. There's not a an example of this but we also don't want to rule it out that if some benefactor who maybe graduated from a PPS high school wanted to make a contribution, a significant contribution that would fund staff. I'm going to use Benson as an example to fund staff that it could be considered like a one. Like if it was a one time gift or if it was like. Like I wanted just to go to the high Schools we didn't want to say, like we would never consider an extraordinary generous gift versus having individual school communities just raising money for their own schools.

D: That was one of my questions was about that exact clause and wondering what could go wrong. And also just, is this a workaround? I just was wondering if there were other examples. I mean, we've had people ask if they could have donate and name a stadium or you know, after them.

start time: 480:16:42.000

start time: 480:44:10.000
end time: 486:34:00.000
confidence: 0.93
D: I'm wondering if there's another. You don't want to discourage someone from making a generous donation. But I think, I thought that the role of this punishment policy was so that we would prohibit the funding of staff. But this is an exception that I'm just wondering which schools and where's that going to show up?

start time: 486:43:00.000
end time: 489:38:40.000
confidence: 0.86
A: This is more focused on like an individual, like one large individual donation versus like school based fundraise raising.

start time: 490:00:20.000
end time: 497:23:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah, I'm just, I'm wondering though we do have individuals that would be able to make large contributions to the school of their choice. I'm thinking of someone at Jefferson specifically, but not every school has a benefactor like that. And so I'm just wondering how this might play out and if this would be a workaround for schools that do have more of those individuals that have higher incomes that could make a $50,000, $100,000 donation and it would be helping them out.

start time: 498:26:20.000
end time: 505:29:26.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I say I couldn't think of an individual example, a person where it's happened. So. But then again, I'm also thinking in your particular example, would we want to tell that individual like that we wouldn't want that donation or would we want to maybe have a.

start time: 505:30:38.000
end time: 509:12:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: We do want your donation. Thank you for your generosity. And our policy requires that we could don't fund staff, however, it could fund other activities, programming. You know, it goes into the bucket with everyone else's donation.

end time: 512:24:28.000
confidence: 0.90
E: Doesn't mean if we have funding for capital from one school, that would mean it would free up capital to work on. Money is easier to.

start time: 512:26:44.000
end time: 517:31:40.000

A: Here's one thing, it's definitely not a workaround. Believe me, after six years, and I'm not putting something together to create a workaround, we could take it out. And frankly, if somebody came forward and said, I have an extraordinary large gift, you can always suspend a policy to accept it.

start time: 517:32:20.000

confidence: 0.97
D: I mean, so why wouldn't we put it that way? Because I'm looking at unintended consequences. I always like to look at what could go wrong, who's this workaround designed to benefit. And some of those questions, if that were to happen and somebody had a very generous gift, we would thank them and tell them that we stand firmly on our policy. We developed this over years with input from lots of community members.

A: What I'm going to suggest is that we take it out and we can have the discussion. If we decide we want to put it back in, we could always put it back in. Or I say there's nothing to stop any future board from. If somebody says, I have $50 million I want to give to all the elementary schools, not the high schools, but all the elementary schools, you know, my guess is the board will be like, we'll suspend the policy for this particular thing.

E: No, no, because I mean, like, your reasons you brought up were pretty valid, too. Like, I'm kind of like on both sides. Like, I understand. I am a little also sketchy about funding staff just because that can lead to inequities, which is why I was like, well, I guess my question is if someone came with $50 million and said, hey, I want to donate $50 million to Benson, it doesn't have to be four staff. It could be. Or whatever. Could they still do that? Because it's not for staff.

A: Is that the consensus? I'd like to strike it because I don't want it to be perceived as a loophole. This is more just what if randomly somebody wanted to give us money. Like would we want to turn it down. But I do know that there are pathways. Even if our policy says that or it's a conversation with the donor of like you might want to give it not to this particular school for this staff. Here's what our policy requires. And so maybe they do something different.

I know the other one was required and yeah, you answered that this was encouraged because it's no longer a school based funding ED staff. Right.

start time: 623:31:50.000
end time: 631:05:00.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I mean there was pushback from the PTAs and some of the booster clubs and individual foundations about the district requiring them to do things. And I don't know what we get from require versus encourage and then show them the value of being part of a larger foundation.

I mean I would hope that it would be viewed as having extra resources and connections to other school community.

So I'd like to recommend moving this to the full board for first reading since the committee supportive of moving out with a recommendation for first reading.

confidence: 0.94
A: Okay, great. All right, so the next meeting is April 2nd. If we can have it on the agenda for a first reading, that'd be great. All right, on to the next item on the agenda. We have a proposed policy from recommended or brought to the committee. As everybody can. Just so people know, everybody can bring a policy for consideration. This was brought by Director Green and I believe he also has some business in or in the student Success committee as well. So this particular policy that Director Green has recommended. 6.2 0.043 makes. Sorry, just a couple changes to this policy that it essentially adds that there's other provisions relating to the military. And this would add a permission or may establish that a high school principal may establish a Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program that aligns with PPS academic standards and policies and administrative directors in consultation with an approval of the superintendent. So this isn't approving a Junior Reserve Officer training program in particular, but it says that a principal. It provides the process by which, if a principal wanted to do that, the process by which they would do that. And then I know in your committee there's a lot of discussion about the actual programmatic piece of it. In addition, I want to note that at the last committee meeting, there were questions from committee members about things like alignment with CTE standards, career opportunities, academic integration, leadership development, college and career readiness, community engagement, equity inclusion, resource allocation, monitoring and evaluation, and last licensure. And at the time, what's Chris Breda's official title? Is he. Oh, there he is.

H: I'm here. Well, and full transparency. I have a 5 month old next to me, so you're going to hear probably two people talking.

start time: 711:40:00.000
end time: 713:16:20.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Okay, well, thanks for being here. I was prepared to present for you.

H: I got it. I didn't want you to have to. Steve for me, so I'm here.

start time: 715:11:30.000
end time: 727:35:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So I was just. The frame up is we asked some particular questions at the last meeting. I really appreciate that, even with you being out, that you got right after it and talked to some of the districts in the state. And we have a document that I believe has been posted that provides some general themes without really connecting them to individual districts. But I really appreciate you doing that. Do you want to present the main themes that you heard back based on those topic areas or do you want to provide a summary of your research?

start time: 727:40:50.000
end time: 753:20:00.000
confidence: 0.96
H: I'm happy to. Okay, so in the, in the document there is a. There's sort of two parts to it. So the first part is the sort of considerations that CTE would make for the addition of any new program, regardless of its sort of career cluster area. And so those are the things that Director Brim Edwards was sort of pointing to before about how does it align with CTE standards, what are the career opportunities, so on and so forth. So there are sort of 10 buckets that we, you know, would consider if we were going to move a CTE program forward. The second piece is that I was asked to reach out to folks both at the state level and nationally. So I reached out to two districts, both locally and nationally, like I mentioned, who have JROTC programs just to sort of get the high level themes. And you know, I think, I think my approach generally to this, to this process was to be as unbiased as possible. Really just wanted to get a sense of. Yeah, thank you. To get a sense of what is happening in those districts that have jrotc. And so the sort of themes that emerged. The first one is that both district chair and there was a, that there was a lack of local control because the JROTC programs are run by the. Hold on, hold on.

D: He's so cute.

start time: 757:41:00.000
end time: 767:13:00.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Thank you. So, yeah, the first one is that both districts sort of express expressed concerns and challenges that the fact that there's no sort of local control, the military sort of has full control over who the teacher is. They go through the vetting process. And so ultimately they're hired by the military. The programs are funded by the military. They both use language like the number of strings attached to the relationship because really it's not sort of Managed by the district. It's managed by the military partner.

start time: 767:32:00.000
end time: 767:41:12.000
confidence: 0.87
E: Second.

start time: 767:42:56.000
end time: 814:14:20.000
confidence: 0.96
H: They, they both talked about the challenges in maintaining the program. The requirement of the teacher coming into this position would be 15 years of military experience. And so both expressed some challenges with, with finding the right sort of teachers to do that. The teachers still go through the same licensure process in Oregon for CTE that they would, you know, regardless of the career that they come from. But there is that sort of additional caveat, which is the 15 years of military experience being required. And one of the districts mentioned that they were having a hard time finding a second qualified instructor since COVID So they really have been like, they have one instructor who has been there for a long time, and they've been having a really hard time sort of aligning with the military on the second instructor. There is a difference between the two districts. One has it as a CTE program under the career sort of cluster area of national security, and the other one doesn't because their state law does not allow them to have JROTC part of cte. So I sort of talked about some of the differences there. They both talked about the sort of importance of the community engagement and service pieces that JROTC does. They both pointed to the positive impact they had on students and the community, that they spent considerable time performing community service activities. And then, you know, and they both sort of emphasized the importance of the leadership skills that were being developed as part of the programs. Another challenge that emerged was just adapting the military structure high school setting, right, because we're talking about 15 to 18 year old students effectively. And so the requirement of having someone that needs to be 15 plus years of service makes it so. There's a relatively significant gap between that person's sort of like professional career and their time in school. And so there, there was some, some, you know, some dissonance between, between the expectations of what high school is like and sort of what the military time was like. And then the last one, they both pointed just to some outcome data. Students are successful in those programs. You know, in the programs that are cte, they sort of match the outcome data that sort of points to graduation rates being higher for students who complete CTE pathways. And so they both pointed to that as well. Students are successful and there are lots of students enrolled in those programs. And so there's no sort of concern about them going away or dwindling. So yeah, students are participating and they're being successful.

start time: 815:44:00.000
end time: 816:29:44.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And being successful in the.

start time: 816:29:52.000
end time: 832:56:20.000
confidence: 0.93
H: Rest of the process, graduating certainly at a higher rate. And the program that's in Oregon, the CTE program, they were very intentional about making sure that it wasn't just sort of military focused. And so their sort of advisory committee that advises the JROTC program also includes law enforcement, emergency services, FBI, sort of like a more robust collection of folks that are, that are in the sort of, you know, law enforcement and you know, national security space that it wasn't just focused on like this being a pipeline to the military. So they structured it intentionally to be that way. So it was, you know, a little bit more broad based. And the students that, you know, the skills that they were learning essentially in those programs could be, could be sort of translated or transferred to other fields in the same sort of umbrella cluster.

end time: 868:00:20.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I don't have any questions, but I just want to make a comment about. I'm not in favor at all of having a policy that allows a pathway for this program to happen in Portland at all. I'm patently opposed to it. I've talked to lots of people, various people, some that have been in the military and including just today at lunchtime with a PPS grad who's quite a bit older than I am. Believe it or not. What he said was focus on providing other pathways. Culinary, electrical, medical, dental, construction trades, auto mechanic. Green jobs sector is growing. You know, renewables, battery storage, aquaponics, solar installations, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and some of those other paths, pathways besides a militaristic pathway. I know that you're talking about it in the success, student success. And I do understand that there are some statistics that show that kids that are involved in this program do have better attendance and higher grades. I'm concerned that Portlanders are sitting ducks basically being recruited by the military. And I'm just philosophically opposed to doing that recruitment in our schools from our community. I think for the students that are interested in the military, they will find the military like my dad did after he graduated from school here in Portland. I really am opposed to having the presence in schools.

start time: 868:06:00.000
end time: 873:12:46.000
confidence: 0.94
B: From what I understood it a previous student success meeting, that they'll start with the military providing the teacher and then you need to provide one yourself later to either supplement it or not take over. But didn't you understand that too, Eddie?

start time: 873:14:38.000
end time: 874:18:54.000
confidence: 0.87
E: Yeah, I said I don't know if it's replacing the teacher or the funding goes away.

start time: 874:21:42.000
end time: 881:12:52.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Yeah, maybe the funding went away. I don't know. And so that would mean, of course, you're taking some fte away from another type of teacher if you continue the program, if you continue with the rotc. And I need more information on that. But that came up as something that would be taking away a teacher for another class.

start time: 881:15:56.000
end time: 887:31:18.000
confidence: 0.96
D: That's important. And also I thought the program required their teachers, not. Not our teachers. In other words, they're not even certified teachers. And I mean, is this. Are we trying to solve for attendance or are we trying to solve for achievement gap or. I think that's what are we trying to solve for or is it just a menu of options?

start time: 887:32:54.000
end time: 892:10:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I'm going to channel Director Green, who unfortunately is out of town. I mean, this is my opinion. But what are you trying to solve for? I think he wants to solve for. This is a career pathway that should. Students should have access to.

start time: 892:42:00.000
end time: 894:39:40.000
confidence: 0.98

D: It really worries me where it would be offered, and it feels very untested. It feels like we should do better about offering other members menu items of things that are interesting. Stem, you know, if we start to look at the jobs of the future, you know, the military, we should be training our kids in STEM activities that support the green sector, where they will have jobs in the future and not the military. I think of a student wants to get into the military, they know exactly how to get there. By the time they're 16, they know how to sign up. And many, many students do sign up on their own. Sometimes as young as 16 or 17, they need to get their parents permission. But I'm not. I'm opposed to having it in Portland Public Schools because I'm afraid of who it would be offered to.

I: Yeah, yeah, thank you. Some of the stuff about the GRTC program piece and you know, to talk to director of the past at this point of, you know, if people want to go to military, they can have the option, they can take it on their own. But you can say that for every industry, whether it's culinary, whether it's plumbing, whether it's electrical, you know, there's always other ways you can, you can seek out if that's something you want to do. I think the point of this is just to give kids another option. Just like what we do at Benson and we introduce them to and with our CTE program. It's great. Our CTE programs in Portland Public Schools I believe is second to none. You know, they do offer electric, electrical, they do offer plumbing, they do offer other, other pathways. And I think to exclude another pathway, I think that that limits our kids of what they least have access to versus, you know, us making the decision if something is right for them or should be right for them, I think they should be able to experience it and then decide for themselves that this is something that they want to do or they don't. They want to do or they don't want to do instead of us making that decision unilaterally for them. And that's kind of what I see the JRTC program doing is just giving them another outlet. Just like plumbing, electrical, being a doctor, culinary that we have on our schools, just another opportunity for them to explore career pathways, any pathway, any industry. You're going to have horror stories. I can tell you horror stories about trucking. I can tell you horror stories about people getting their hand cut off in culinary schools or fingers cut off in culinary schools. There's always going to be four stories and they're always going to be the size of every coin. And so all I'm saying is we need to be able to show our kids both sides for them to make their decision of what's going to be best for them and not what we feel is going to be best for them.

E: Thanks, Director. Thank you. Yeah, quick question, Director Hollins. I always love how you put stuff. Thank you. Yeah, I'm still want to scrutinize also. Keep an open mind. My question is to Chris Bright. I don't know if this is answerable, but you mentioned about the increased engagement and success of students and maybe even graduation rate. You know, but you know the JROTC is a self selecting, right. These students are self selecting to go into these programs. Right. And that could be same could be said for other CTEs, like for example like automotive or construction. Right. So these students self select into construction cte. Would we see the similar graduation rates increase and engagement from like other CTs like construction. So when we take a comparison of other cts construction, compare the GR to otc. Is there like what's the difference? Right. Is there a delta there?

start time: 965:31:10.000
end time: 988:01:52.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Yeah, yeah, I don't think that there is. I mean the sort of like national story about CTE is that for students who are completing cte. So the sort of federal definition of that is students who complete three credits in a specific CTE pathway, nationally graduation rates are about 10% higher than students who don't. That same story sort of exists in Oregon as well. And it's sort of agnostic of the pathway that students are in. So it doesn't matter if it's JROTC or construction or electrical. If students are finishing three years of those programs, we see sort of like I think Director Pass was speaking to like their attendance is higher, their grades are higher and their graduation rates tend to be higher as well. So there isn't a delta necessarily between the types of programs they all are successful because to your point, Director Wang, it's that students are self selecting into things that they're passionate about. And so when students can self select into things that they're passionate about, that sort of drives attendance, that drives the rest of, you know, sort of the work that they're doing. So yeah, so I mean that's the reason why I cte, you know, sort of nationally is that way, locally is that way because it is sort of the, the hands on passion project of a lot of our students and it is a big reason why many of them come to school in the first place.

A: Go ahead. I was just going to for, and this may be in your committee that I think it would be helpful is that we have amazing CTE strands now. So I think of like when my kids were in high school, like very little. And so I think the theory is this is like something else that kids could be passionate about, just like the whole host of other things. And I'm really proud of PPS and the work that's happened over the last 10 years. And also coming out of past Post ballot measure 98 where there was more dedicated funds and really a realization of this link between really connecting kids to the real world and things that are outside of just the very traditional academic subjects. And so I think it would be worthwhile just to look at what else is offered because I don't. It used to be there was if you went to this school you would have maybe a pretty rich set of options and if you went to this school you had a much more natural narrow and that's just not the case. The last time I looked at the matrix, it's pretty amazing what's offered. So I think that would be useful to see because I would say that their challenge would be you've got to make yourself as amazing as any of these other options, because it's not like, do you want to go to physics class or this other interesting thing that you might be interested in? Nothing wrong with physics. Sorry. God damn it. I was trying to think of what you were, and I couldn't remember what you taught.

A: Oh, my gosh. I was just speaking from my own personal experience. It was different back then. So, you know, I think that would be a challenge. Is like, classes now have to show they're compelling because students get to choose among some really interesting topics. So I think that would just add to the conversation because I do think it's changed. Just, I know from certainly my experience, when I was in pps, there was voced, and then there was a period where we didn't really have anything, and now we have, fortunately, a very robust, I think, way more equitable set of choices. And. Sorry, Director Hollins, not just at Benson anymore.

D: Yeah. Benson takes the cake there. So there an article appeared in the New York Times, and it's a little bit out of date. I believe it's June. It was updated June of 23, and the title is Thousands of Teens are being pushed into military's Junior rotc. And I would just encourage us to all read that. And in the article, there's some places or examples of where guardrails could be placed. In other words, the headline here is that high schools across the country, students are being placed in military classes without electing them on their own. And it sounds like we would have a we could opt in program. And I also just believe if we had a robust CTE offerings at each school. I don't think we need the military. I leave it to the rest of the board. But I'm just expressing my philosophical discomfort with having military presence in our schools.

start time: 1053:28:10.000
end time: 1086:26:50.000
confidence: 0.93
I: All right. And I am on the same level as you as far as about the military. I used to be for our black kids and what kind of effect that that could have on our black kids getting into the military. I was. I was one of those things that. And it was an old movie that, you know, I think it was Lawrence, Pittsburgh who said, the military is no place for a black man. Right. And so I took that for a long time until I start really looking at what it does when my kids were about to go to college. And then, you know, when going to hbcu, seeing the effects of kids who have been in ROTC program or their ROTC program and then do those in college. My perspective changed a lot because you was hearing the stories and not just the stories of them being in college and graduating at a higher rate and having more passions of what they're doing, the opportunities for the new things that you're talking about, the new, the new workforce they're teaching AI in the military. A lot of the stuff that we get now has came out of the military. And so by seeing that my perspective has changed on the whole military piece, especially for black folks and specifically black men, and talking with those that like Mr. McKenzie, his brother was part of that, my uncle was part of it. And talking to them about what's the real that happens in there and talking to them about saying, hey, what is this? Like what are the experiences? And their good experiences outweigh the bad. And that's kind of what has changed my perception of the military and how it, how it can help us or how it has hurt us in the past.

end time: 1105:56:30.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Thank you. Yeah, yeah. I have a comment and a question. So one thing that was added in the policy, I don't know if you read my mind or I talked to you about it, but some guardrails, which I was in supportive of the part where it says, you know, this can only be approved in consultation with an approval of the superintendent. You know, high school principal may establish a JROTC program aligns with. And this is a key here that aligns with PPS academic standards, policies and administrative directives. Right. And I think that's an important guardrail for me if we're going to pass something like that, because it has to. And Chris, right up you mentioned about things about one of the themes with other districts is that there's a little, it seems like there's some wrestling of authority over the curriculum. Right. Because whether or not the military pays for it, it's our students. And if we have this in there, these guardrails like pps, academic standards policies and administrative directors. I'm specifically thinking about academic standards. Is would the GRTC even qualify to be able to taught as. Is.

start time: 1107:53:46.000
end time: 1135:35:20.000
confidence: 0.96
H: But I mean it's our dancer. In the conversations that I had, I think that the sort of general sentiment was the curriculum comes from the military and because they are funding the teachers and the program. And I don't know about the high school success piece that you mentioned, you know, in sort of the cases of folks that I spoke to that are, you know, in my position in other districts, there wasn't any mention that they eventually absorbed those programs. It's still being run sort of by the military. So because of that, the curriculum comes from the military, the instructors are sort of vetted and ultimately hired by the military, and the funding comes from the military as well. And so, you know, like, then the. As a result, sort of like the military events that come along with being a JRRTC program happen. Right. There's usually a color guard, those kinds of things. And so, you know, I think. I think it's an interesting question that you sort of bring up about what sort of our role is. If this was a CTE space, you know, sort of like what our lens on this is and the amount of control that we would actually have over making those decisions. I think there's some. Like I mentioned before, there's a district in our state that has a program who, you know, they bring in also law enforcement and first responders as part of the advisory committee to make sure that sort of, like, tangential skills are being taught, and it isn't just sort of focused on the military, but there are other programs in our state that are not cte. That. It is my understanding that those programs generally are run by the military and is their curriculum.

start time: 1138:42:43.000
end time: 1149:29:20.000
confidence: 0.99
H: Yeah, they do have to go through. So they have to go through the same licensure process. So the. The sort of. One caveat that's different about this particular role is that the military requires that they have 15 years of experience, whereas, like, a normal sort of, like, industry process, we would just look for 2000 hours of industry experience would be the sort of, like, threshold that. That would allow someone to, you know, begin the licensure process. But then after that sort of first criteria is met, we would still go through the same licensure process. So they are. They do have a teaching license in the same way that any other CTE teacher does.

A: Okay, so. So thank you for coming on short notice. We weren't expecting you. I'm just thinking about Director DePass comments. And as a parent of three, I had one child who expressed often an interest and still do, but I think he's about aged himself out of his interest in the military for a variety of reasons. Like, the whole leadership training that comes with that, the structure, exposure to Just a lot of different technical skills and being outside of a traditional academic environment or more being outside of the regular academic environment or a profession that is linked to a particular academic focus area. So I do, you know, when Director Green raises the issue of like, this isn't for everybody, but it is for some students. I think just my three kids and I have one of three who that would apply to. So I'm supportive with, again, the conditions, Eddie, that you shared that have been built into the policy. Again, this is just establishing a process. It doesn't actually establish the program at any of our schools. So with that, I'm wondering if we have move it out of committee. I understand Director depasi will not be supported.

And just to provide background since it's been a long time since we had our first reading is while the title says class size guidelines, which implies it's about a bigger topic really the change that was made to the. It looks like I don't actually have the policy in front of me.

end time: 1258:46:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I'm on my paper version. Sorry. Thank you. So there was an existing policy and the only change that's been added is class side guidelines and school staff allocations for focus programs. Focus schools and dual immersion schools shall align with school staff allocations and class size guidelines for neighborhood schools. So what was happening is that focus programs were setting their class sizes at the school level versus at the district level. So there's a big staffing manual that describes in great detail the class sizes for our schools depending on if they're, you know, what, what level they are, what the title school is. A whole host of factors, but that's all set the district level. And then depending on how many students and the type of students, then you get a certain number of teachers. So at first focus programs it was being set at the school and in some cases not aligned. So neighborhood schools might have had much larger class sizes because they were using the district standard versus focus programs. And so this just brings everything into a central place for the. Those decisions to be made versus being made by individual schools. And so it's been first read. And so unless there's some sort of objection, I'd like to ask that we. I don't even know that I need to vote but like that it. Go for a second. Have a second reading.

A: So I think our district wide staffing already has flexibility to take into consideration things we have every year, always some set aside fte that if there is a spot in the district where it would be needed. I would, I would say that some of the issues that were raised earlier about this policy are no, actually no different than some of the other immersion programs that have a lot of students who either for a variety of reasons. I mean, immersion can be challenging. But I would say. And we don't have a district staff person here to confirm. But in the. My experience is that that's where we use our set aside when there are sort of extraordinary circumstances.
