And Gary already said it. Welcome back to Portland Public Schools. This is an extremely thorough process, an extremely comprehensive process. As you know, having gone through it, I always think it's exciting when we do that type of national recruitment and we end up finding someone not only with the national experience, but also the local exposure to our district. So we're really excited to have you back. Back. I'm really looking forward to what you're going to bring to this district and all that we're going to achieve over the next few years.

E: It is with great joy that I welcome Dr. Armstrong to her new job as superintendent of Portland Public Schools. We all know that this is a challenging job that needs a strong leader with many skills, and in particular, a person who values students and teachers. I believe that Kimberly is that person. It is a great responsibility to choose a new leader for our district. We have spent hours looking through resumes and recommendations. We narrowed a field of 12 down to five. Then after meeting with those five, narrowed the field to the final three. This was exciting because I felt we had three great candidates that would be able to lead the district. They met with students, people in the community, staff and union leaders. We were able to get input from all groups. Again, more reading, more thinking. I felt relieved because I knew that we had three quality people who could do a great job as our superintendent, but who would be the best choice for PPs. And this was hard. At this point, we were at the last step in the process. We had a one and a half hour interview with each candidate, and after each interview, I would review my notes and think, this is the one. The hardest part, as I said, was making the final choice. Would we all agree? Yes. It was unanimous. It was Kimberly. I would like to share some quotes from the students that interviewed. Kimberly. I like that one. Of her main initiatives is building trust in the system. She seems like she is really true to herself, courageous, comfortable. She's really learning still learning from students, engages and listens, has what it takes. And finally, my favorite, she's gonna cook. So welcome to PPS Dr. Kimberly Armstrong. And we are ready to cook with.

F: Good morning. I'm going to just start by thanking board leadership for leading this process and all board members for getting us here today. Really a group effort, but appreciate the strong leadership from chair Hollins and Vice Chair Green. Superintendent Armstrong, I love this. As a school board member, I have over 12 years, I've had an opportunity to hire three superintendents and it's one of the most important. And we'll all realize this since this is the first time for the rest of the board. But this is our most important decision we really make as, as a board because it's the person who's going to trans help us transform our district and lead the teachers and the principals and all the school district staff and making a difference for our kids. So this is a really momentous morning and we're at a really challenging time in this district. And I know, you know that we've had a challenging several last years with COVID and students being out of school, whether for the strike and again, students being out of school, the challenges with state funding. And yet I'm optimistic about our future. I know when we talked about, we talked with our community about the characteristics that we wanted in our next leader, and they're always different because times change and the characteristics that the community identified that they wanted in a leader and said to the board, like, go find an individual who fits these characteristics. That's the right fit for the right time. And I really believe we found the right leader at the right time. I'm excited about your leadership. I'm also excited because this is the first time in 20 years we've had a superintendent who's also been a parent in pps. And I know there's seven of us up here who have been parents in pps and I know that shapes how we think about the school district, our passion for the work. So I'm excited that that's a lens that along with everything else you're going to bring to the district that you'll also have had that experience like many of us and people throughout the city have had. So welcome back and congratulations.

B: I don't even know that I have all the words in me to be able to say just how excited I am that we have you here, because this is not just something that you talk about. This is not just something that you know that you've done because you're trying to fill a role. This is literally who you are. You care about the people, you care about our kids, you care about moving the needle, not because it gets a check, because you genuinely care about transforming our society from what it is to what you know that it can be. And you're excited about the role that you're going to play in that process. So, to me, this was a no brainer. This was a no brainer. I wasn't selecting just somebody who was going to fill a seat. I wasn't selecting somebody who was just going to come in and try to advance their career. I knew that this was a selection process for somebody who was going to be thinking about not what they can get right now, but how it's going to transition, transform tomorrow for my grandkids who are going to be going through PPS one day. And I knew that you were that person because this is literally who you are. It's the fiber of your being. On the good days and the bad days, this is still who you are. When people are talking about you and when they're not, this is still who you are. You're going to get up and you're going to do something every day to transform us from where we are to where we need to be. So this was a no brainer for me. This was. I was extremely excited. And then when they said, I throw my name in the hat with anybody and I know that I'm going to come out on top, I love that level of confidence because I don't want somebody who's like, oh, I need this and just help me with that. No, throw my hat in the ring with anybody. And when you get finished, I know that I'm better. I know that I'm going to come out on top. Because you have the confidence in yourself and what you bring to the table. This is just who you are. So thank you. Thank you for being you. Thank you for not quitting. Thank you for not giving up. Thank you for believing in the. In the process. Thank you for believing in the kids and thank you for what I know you're going to do.

But I just want to give you my commitment to supporting your success. I've admired your strong determination, your quiet leadership and, and your hope for our students. So my commitment is that I'm here to support your success. I think we're all here to do that and really looking forward to seeing what you bring to this district. Thank you.

C: Just a warning before I start. The language center of my brain doesn't start until 9am so this might come out a little funny. I really want to start by really saying thank you for especially going through this process. I know one thing that we had a hard time deciding was whether we wanted to make the process public and have the finalists names out there. And I know that as a candidate that's really scary because you know, it's, you know. So I want to acknowledge that putting your name in there when it's a potential public affair is very scary or can be very scary. And it shows some bravery. And again, language centers are starting to haven't started. And one of the things that as we went through this process, the community feedback and all these things, we got three really strong candidates. And I have no doubt that any of those three would be excellent. But the thing we were really considering was who would be best for what we need at this time. As you know, we went through really rough year, A lot of instability, rough years. And the thing that really came out about you, about being in everything that we've heard about you, it was just like it was a, it was a home run. It was something that we, when we looked at it and heard everything about you and how you work and it was what we did just unanimously decided this is what we need at this time and in the future. And so with a huge excitedness. I know it doesn't show at 8:30 in the morning, but absolutely excited that we are named you the new superintendent. So congratulations and I am really looking forward to working with you and helping support you to help push us to the next level.

I: So first of all, Director Green stole my speech. I was going to talk about care a lot. So I guess whole shift focus there like other people were mentioning, this really was a community led process. And I think that's reflected in the candidate we selected. You don't just feel like a part of the community, you are. And I think that's something really, really special that's going to take this district very far. And I think you do lead with passion, 100%. But you also lead with compassion, and I think that really sets you apart. And I'm so excited to see what that brings to the district. So Phoenixes are one of my favorite creatures. I really think there's something to be learned from the way every time they fall, they can get back up. And that's sort of how I view PBS right now. And I think you are that spark that's going to let the phoenix rise again. And I only have one more year in pps, but I feel so incredibly lucky to say that that year, you're going to be my superintendent, and you're going to be the superintendent for generations of future students. And they're also very, very lucky. So it's a very, very enthusiastic yes from me. Welcome.
