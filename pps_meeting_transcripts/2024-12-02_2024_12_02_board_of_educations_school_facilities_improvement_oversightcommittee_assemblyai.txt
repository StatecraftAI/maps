A: Okay. I believe I have the green light to get going. So I think that's your job, Director Green. Great. We're going to go ahead and get started. Welcome to the meeting of the School Facilities Improvement and Operations Committee. Appreciate folks being here tonight. We've got just one thing on the agenda tonight. We're going to talk about a potential referral of a 2024 bond. The order of the agenda, we are going to do public testimony first. So I think we've got four people signed up for two minute slots. We're going to do that and then we're going to go into a conversation with the board. Just as a reminder, from a process standpoint, this is one of our board committees and it is me, Director Green and Director Brim Edwards who are on that committee. But of course we welcome all board members come and I'm glad we've almost got a full house with the exception of Director Holland's today for the committee meeting, which is great. Before just. I'm going to take 60 seconds before public testimony, mostly just to set a little bit of context for tonight. I hope everyone's had a chance to look at the staff report and materials that were provided to the board a few days ago. They are public, they are on the PPS website. And I did get a number of emails today. Thank you for sending the emails. And I wanted to just again provide a little context because I'm a little worried that there might be some missing information out there in the community. We're going to get into this in a lot more detail, but I know a lot of the emails I received today were focused on concern that we were somehow taking funds away from either the Ida B. Wells or Cleveland restoration. And I want to assure people that is not what's on the table for tonight. So what's on the table for tonight? And there's a whole number of things that are in there, but the funding for school modernizations, which was at about $1.1 billion, is still at $1.1 billion. What you will hear us talk about tonight is the possibility of can we fit into that $1.1 billion than we had planned on before. And I'm going to let staff deal with the details around this. But this is really based on the superintendent sort of coming in and saying, you know, we need to be really good fiscal stewards of taxpayer dollars. We know that we can look at what other high schools have been built. We can look at our own high schools, right, that have been built. We know that Lincoln was built I wrote this down. We do have a full house. Welcome, Director Hollins. Lincoln was finished in 2022 for a budget of $225 million. Lincoln is a beautiful school. If you haven't seen it, it. It's got everything that's needed. What the question that the superintendent, I think, rightfully asked is, as we're going through this planning process, what is the target that we want to hit for these new high schools? And that is still an open question. So what you see in the package, and if you look at the language in the. In the memo, you'll see we are not saying that these schools have to come in less. We're saying we hope they can. I hope they can. You should hope they can, too. From, from, from a community perspective, to be really, really blunt about it, if these high schools cost 425 to $450 million, they won't be the most schools built in Oregon. They may be the most expensive high schools ever built in the United States. That is not an award that we want to win. And so we need to be really, really prudent with these, with these dollars. But what's really. What I love about the staff proposal tonight is that it leaves flexibility. What it says is we're not going to reduce the modernization budget. We're going to keep it at $1.1 billion. If at the end of this process, there is just no way to reduce those high schools, there is enough funding there to build them. But I hope there is, because to the extent there is, it frees up money and potentially significant amount of money for other facility problems in the district, including our middle schools and our elementary schools. And those of you in my zone, which has Ida B. Wells, know from this last year how devastating those facility failures can be. And so I think that's really what we're. What we're trying to talk about and leave some of that flexibility. So with that as a little bit of context, I want to go into public testimony, then staff report, and then we're going to have a conversation. So, Kara, you want to call the first couple people who are signed up?

B: Well, good evening, Superintendent Armstrong, PPS Board members, Student Representative Kuceve. My name is Megan Stefik. That's S T E F F E k. I have two children born in 2008 and 2010, around the time that the Cleveland Modernization bond failed, Cleveland was moved to the back of the line. Like other parents, students and Cleveland staff who have given testimony here over the past several months, I was shocked to see the neglect of Cleveland High School over the years. I now have a junior who is a captain of the varsity co captain, excuse me, of the varsity softball team and is on track to graduate with a full IB diploma. I have a freshman in band as well as track and field. I am invested in the school community. My children will not see a modernized Cleveland High School. I participate in the PPS Modernization Design Advisory Group for Cleveland High School. I am fascinated by the process and I appreciate the meaningful conversation with stakeholders. Initially, I joined so that this modernization does not repeat the softball discrimination of the past, namely Grant High School in 2019, but also Franklin High School in 2017 Lake Oswego High School 2016 Gresham High School San Barlow High School 2022. These are several examples of the Title IX filings and lawsuits in our area. Further, I joined to ensure that even if softball and baseball get turf fields in the design that they do not fall short of NFHS regulation. Field speculations at pell park like McDaniel High School in 2021 where their beautiful new turf fields were unplayable for two years after the school reopened. So I represent Turf Pell Park. We are a group of softball and baseball parents. Initially, that group has grown significantly. Cleveland High School student athletes have dealt with unfair and unsanitary and unsafe conditions at Woodstock Park, Powell Park, Westmoreland Park. Turf fields also increase playability. Turf fields, excuse me, allow increased playability in Oregon weather conditions and minimize the risk of injuries due to level surfaces. Better traction, shock absorption lights ensure that we can practice later into the days, into the evenings. Lights and a secure location in close proximity to the high school community will deter theft, vandalism and destruction. Our students deserve equality in athletic facilities now, not in 2028 when the high school modernization is anticipated to be complete. They deserve facilities that will allow them to thrive Amongst the competitive OSAA 6A school programs. I have given public comment along with others in the Turf Powell park supporters at the Portland Parks and Rec Board meetings asking them to work with PPS leadership toward a mutually beneficial long term lease of Powell Park. I have received no response. We have received no response.

I also want to thank you for adding back the $75 million in athletic improvements that was omitted from last board meeting materials as that will help Grant High School bowl. It will help Franklin and it will help. So I will speed it up a little bit here.

B: This answer to I. I see in the memo tonight and I'm disappointed in the reduction of funds for Cleveland High school. It's about $108 million. I think we need to urge you to have a solid discussion of a quality high school that meets the district's ed specs with equitable athletic facilities. If you intend to maintain that 108 billion dollar budget cut. Million dollar budget cut. I urge you to fully fund the Cleveland remodel at 468 million. And I have listened to discussions here and I know that we can increase that amount. And Director Scott, you had mentioned that might be part of the discussion tonight, but maintain the tax rate. So I urge you to continue that discussion and I know that the Cleveland community will support what you put forth in the May 2025 bond.

B: Dollar upgrades that can be executed very quickly. And if you're looking at it like a business, this is the one thing that you can do that can actually generate money. These fields in this space should be managed like a business for these schools.

F: Attend Wells next year. I am here today to advocate on two main bond inclusions. First, please prioritize the completion of Ida B. Wells and Cleveland High School modernizations as approved by the board in May 2024 in alignment with the comprehensive plan to provide essential updates including AC classroom upgrades and facilities upgrades to our buildings. These building modernizations are vitally important for our community, our students, staff, families and neighbors. This is not the time to cut corners or eliminate essential upgrades to our learning environments. We need equitable and safe facilities which provide opportunities for students to excel in an environment conducive to learning. Second, please ensure athletic hubs are included in the bond budget. The elimination of athletic hubs from the proposed budget is problematic. Athletic hubs are essential for supporting state mandated physical education curriculum, sports extracurricular activities and ensuring equity across the district. Athletic hubs will also preserve continued access, particularly for schools that may lack adequate facilities now or during planned construction. For example, Ida B. Wells will not have enough outdoor field space available in Southwest Portland to meet our school needs during our modernization project. Jackson Middle School has been approved as our cluster's local athletic hub already. As an athlete with personal experience practicing playing at Jackson, it has nowhere near the resources currently that would allow for.

This option for for the Jackson athletics is not currently included in the bond budget and should be I do understand that I may not be an IWS student when the modernization is complete, but my brother may be as a member of the class of 2029 and our neighborhood elementary students undoubtedly will. I'm almost done and our amazing IWLS teachers and staff will also have the opportunity to teach in a building that encourages learning and positive engagement from their students. That is why I am here today to advocate for the future of Ida B. Wells and our community. It is vitally important that this board, you all as decision makers, continue to maintain your commitment to advocating for equitable and safe facilities, creating opportunities for students to learn and excel in an environment that is encouraging learning. We appreciate your follow through in ensuring the Wells and Cleveland modernizations are fully funded and the Southwest Portland Athletic cup is included in the bond budget.

B: Kirsten Carr Last name is C A R R First I wanted to say I'm trying to practice more gratitude, especially this time of year and I really wanted to express some gratitude to the board and also to the staff. I was fully prepared to read this latest proposal and be really upset about it because I think we're trained to be really upset about things and I was really happy. I felt like it was a reflective listening exercise where board members and Community members have been saying for weeks and months, hey, these are the things that we are liking and wanting and needing. The board, the district staff said, what I'm hearing you say is you want more responsible spending. What I'm hearing you say is you want a look at the curriculum to see if we really need to spend that much money. What I'm hearing you say is, and every point is on this proposal. So just to be clear and to say it again, we're not losing $108 million from our schools. We're challenging these guys and these guys to really look at the money that we're spending and spend it well and to take the savings and to spread it around everyone else. Because if we truly have 470 million extra dollars for modernization for elementary and middle schools, that's going to have a huge impact across the district on everyone. So I just wanted to say thank you. I wanted to say all of what he said. So just listen to what Kannon said. I've known this kiddo for a while. He's amazing. And all of what he said, definitely we want to. I'm making some assumptions and I'm going to hold everyone to that. I'm assuming that you're not going to cut quarters in the things that are important, that ED specs are not going to get cut, that you're going to have a reasonable plan for our athletes to be able to continue practicing even if our fields are under construction, and that you're going to make this the most cost effective and yet still livable environment for our students. I really don't think we need to make the most beautiful space because our kids are already super attracted to all the hallways with their cell phones. But I would like a space where we can continue to offer excellent education, offer more CTE than almost any other school in the district at iwls and have all of our AP class offerings.

B: So. So I just wanted to speak a little bit to the proposed reduction of 108 million from the original budget. As maybe y'all also experienced. I had several emails from high school educators and conversations and concerns.

B: What we've seen in previous modernizations is a promise to have things like 80% utilization at Kellogg that then turned into 100% utilization. And those are the types of, you know, at specifications that are really important when we talk about the experience that our students and our educators have at schools. Right. And so I just wanted to kind of lift up, you know, I understand the importance of looking at the finances and trying to make sure that we get more bang for our buck, especially knowing that there is. There's so much deferred maintenance that needs to be updated across all of our schools. And we know. And the reason I think we started with high schools is because all of our students will go to some of these high schools, Right? For the most part, most of our comprehensive high schools. But there is a really big concern that all the planning and all the work that was done in conjunction with educators around what our schools should look like moving forward with the bond might be jeopardized by this change, without necessarily having that feedback from folks who will have to work in those buildings about what that experience will feel like. So things I've heard from educators in high schools, a lot of these spaces in some of our modernized high schools are built to kind of emulate maybe higher education. So there are spaces that can't be utilized for classrooms or confidential conversations. We have schools that are at 100% utilization, which means that they end up having a space used. All spaces are used, all points of the day. So if a student needs to have a confidential conversation with the counselor, they gotta find that counselor. That counselor is not in an office or a classroom that is consistent. Same with flex time. And I'm sure years of high school students know that. That you have flex days and you can't necessarily find that educator because they might be in a different room based on the day, based on the schedule. So I think it's really. I would really want to emphasize the importance of looking at how will these schools be built in a way that will ensure that we give the highest quality educational experience to all of our students that our educators can provide. Because even if you can put us all into the building and have each classroom utilized, you still have educators literally using shopping carts to move their things around. And we want to make sure that they feel that that school is a home, just like we want to make sure schools feel like a home to our students. I am definitely excited about the prospect of increasing modernization and kind of spreading some of that help to our middle and elementary schools. I also know that y'all have a really big challenge, right? There's so many competing needs, and there's only so much you can ask for in a bond. So I don't wish to be in your shoes, and I appreciate the mindful and thoughtful work that's going into this, and I would love to know specifics around. I went through the documents, but what exactly will that 108 million be earmarked for in terms of specific sites, specific projects, and how those would go through? Because I think that's the level of accountability and detail that will help folks who have been planning, especially these high school modernizations feel like, okay, this isn't just someone saying, thanks for your feedback. We're putting that in the trash. But actually saying, thank you for your feedback. Here's some more information. Here are some more needs. Here's how we're going to use these funds to actually support our entire community. So I would ask that we just make sure that that communication is still very open, it's very clear, and that it's consistently going out to our families, our educators, our students in our community that when they vote yes to pass this bond, because our community always shows up for our schools, and we've seen that year time and time again that they know exactly where those funds are going. And, you know, Pat, we will be championing and pushing for that approval of this bond for our city, and we want to make sure that we can speak to how great these changes will be with details. So that's just a little bit of what I wanted to share. Thank you for giving me some time to do that.

A: Yeah, thank you. And I'm only one board member, but I, I, I hope one. I hope the process to date has been effective in including educator voices. It feels like that when I see the, the design advisory group. But I, I hope you also feel like you have a direct line to the district if it feels like we're falling short in any way, because that input from the folks who are working in the building is the only way to make those buildings successful. Absolutely.

D: We have a presentation for you tonight. The road show is we're going to go through these agenda items relatively quickly. We're going to have various staff come up to the table and provide overviews of the different scopes of work and different categories, and then take questions. So we'll move through that thing fairly quick. And there's probably lots of questions that we want to get to. So first we'll start here is the proposed option and as a note we'll talk through each one of these. I'll just note here that the total amount is $18 million below that range of $1.8 million. So we have a little bit of wiggle room, but not a lot of wiggle room if that is still what the range is with those parameters. And the proposed option continues to conform to these parameters that we've talked about in the last number of meetings, including targeting a total bond between 1.5 and 1.8 billion. It's obviously the top end of that. Planning for an eight year bond cycle, retaining the existing tax rate and planning for the next ballot in May of 25 we'll jump right into scope of work. Deferred maintenance and our fiscal improvements is one of the categories of work that totals $190 million which is the same as the last iteration. As we've discussed, a PPS has very legitimate capital needs and $190 million over eight years is a significant amount of money. Eight to 10 years what we roughly anticipate no cost to spend at all, but it's a relatively small investment considering the size of PPS's portfolio and the existing conditions. So what this here shows and which is included in the staff report is a scenario, a sample scenario of how those funds might be spent over that duration. And it assumes that roughly a third of this amount would be needed to address emerg in high priority projects. So about 5 to 10 billion dollars a year which is in the range of what we spend now, that could be more over the life of the bond and the remaining amount would be allocated to address some of the most critical needs across a variety of scopes of work with deferred maintenance, capital renewal and priority project scopes totaling in the many billions of dollars. And a lack of non bond capital funding flexibility for these funds is really going to be critical. I believe if we try to be too specific of where these funds are going to go for those specific projects, we might tie our hands to address urgent needs down the line as we get four, five, six, seven, eight more years into the bone. So that's what I have for the deferred maintenance and fiscal improvements. Are there any questions on that? We can come back to this as well.

start time: 451:18:40.000
end time: 451:31:00.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Sure.

start time: 452:52:00.000
end time: 483:31:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So a question on don't tie your hands. I'm going to agree with Angela with a I think we need to be specific. All parents and students know how bad many of our facilities are and it seems like we've done. I have so many notebooks at home from you, Dan, and the team about our needs. It seems like at a minimum, instead of we need to have the money set aside for like emergencies that seems a reactive way versus we've done the. Here's what the condition is or the life cycle of different systems in our schools that we could at least have some sort of guidelines of. Like, for example, the roofs, like those that are over X number of years over those would be in the first cycle. What I'm concerned about is just having a long list doesn't tell voters exactly how we're going to prioritize. And I know that because I've listened to you for over a decade, that we do have things that we want to prioritize and how do we frame that up in a way that is specific enough so people know, like, hey, we're not going to allow the leaky roof to then like ruin the interior of our buildings because we've made a commitment in this bond with this amount of money that roofs that are over this number of years are going to be first to be replaced. And we're going to set aside a certain amount for those things that we don't anticipate. But we know some of these things have to be in place. So I'm wondering if you could be more specific about how you're going to prioritize them, knowing what we know about our facilities.

start time: 484:02:30.000
end time: 504:25:42.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Sure, it's a good question. I think we're the. I think if we have a specific dollar amount, we can start to hone in a little more on some specifics. And the dollar amount has obviously been changing as we've gone through this process. If we look at the deferred maintenance category, some of the categories of work that are in our facilities condition assessment, which is a few years old now, the total amount of those categories of work, plus a couple others is over a billion dollars of things that are effectively broken now or past their useful life now. So a number of these categories, you could apply all of that to just that one category of work. So for roofs or exterior enclosures, that's going to total over $190 million of what our systems say we should be replacing right now. What this tries to show is we want to be able to spread those across a number of scopes of work. We know when an elevator fails, we try to limp it along. If you have an existing elevator, elevator example, we try to limp them along for as much as possible. Eventually that cab will have to be replaced. That might be $500,000 instead. And it's already gone through school life now, but it might fail next year or it might fail in eight years. And so that's what I mean. The flexibility is we want to get.

start time: 504:26:06.000
end time: 504:41:42.000
confidence: 0.93
B: In front of this as much as.

start time: 504:42:06.000
end time: 515:26:00.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Possible, but we also know that when there is an unexpected piece or something starts leaking more than we anticipated, we want to be able to allocate those funds as quickly as we can and have funds to do that. I certainly understand this. We don't want this to be an opaque process. We want to be very clear of how we prioritize. We have prioritization matrices when new capital projects come in. So I think we can be very clear with that. But I would just caution against, say, over 10 years, be too precise how we're going to spend those funds, because in five years, the urgent needs could be different than what they are today.

start time: 516:00:20.000
end time: 525:24:30.000
confidence: 0.91
B: I have a similar question on that very first slide. I am the emergency projects in the. You know, we lost school time in southwest Portland this year due to the ice storm in January or February. And would the 5 million to 10 million be enough to have covered the damage that we experienced this year? I mean, so that's one question. The other one is, I like that it's somewhat flexible. I mean, it's kind of all rubbled under deferred maintenance, but would also like to have some type of criteria.

start time: 525:59:50.000
end time: 526:05:02.000
confidence: 0.97
E: So.

start time: 526:05:26.000
end time: 528:17:30.000
confidence: 0.93
B: We know how the decisions are being made. And then also I'd like to see some flexibility. If a tree falls on a school that's not in our list.

start time: 528:49:10.000
end time: 528:58:22.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Would our.

start time: 528:58:46.000
end time: 530:00:10.000
confidence: 0.86
B: Plan provide the flexibility that we would need to address the tree fall?

start time: 530:30:30.000
end time: 548:21:50.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Yeah, good question. I mean, the intent in that first category is just to sort of estimate what we're really seeing now and maybe what we might see in the future for emergencies. And these are things that are unexpected. You know, we had a sewer line failure recently, so we had to address that right away. And that was $200,000 or whatever that is. Because of the age of the schools, we're probably going to see more of those now. To director Pomero's point is we want to get in front of those as much as possible. That list to get in front of them is beyond the total amount of funds that we have. So we know to a certain degree we're going to be reactionary, and we want to be able to have the funds, that flexibility to do that. The event that happened, the ice storm last year, was pretty unique as far as the impact and the Cost we haven't seen, as I understand, the district hasn't seen anything like that in decades from people who've been here for decades. So that's unique. But outside that, you know, we are spending somewhere in the five plus million dollar range right now on emergency projects we have roughly.

start time: 549:07:40.000
end time: 554:18:00.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I wanted to sort of maybe a question for my colleagues because when I look at this list, it actually looks pretty specific to me. I mean, we're, you know, estimating nine to 12 roof projects for $60 million or three to five exterior enclosures for $10 million. What does more specificity look like to you, particularly from a bond referral, bond package?

start time: 554:23:40.000
end time: 559:06:10.000
confidence: 0.94
C: It's a sample. So it's like we could choose from this or we could do something else. So a sampling is like, it could be some other things. So if, if it's, we're going to do these things that's, that's more specific and then how we're going to make those decisions.

start time: 559:13:10.000
end time: 562:52:30.000
confidence: 0.96
A: We understand. Yeah, but we wouldn't, we wouldn't want to limit ourselves to a list that we put out. Now, to Dan's point, we need the, I mean, good governance for the district would allow that flexibility.

start time: 562:53:50.000
end time: 563:04:10.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Right.

start time: 563:30:30.000
end time: 577:38:59.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I think we have an obligation to taxpayers to tell them what we're going to utilize generally the money for. So, yeah, I do think we need to be more specific. And this doesn't say like, which schools, which is why I was trying to get like, what's the prioritization process? Because I'll just say you can pick some schools in the district and they will say, and I'll pick Cleveland because my daughter went there with the leaky roofs. It's like, okay, how come the roof didn't get replaced there or Jefferson? They've got a whole host of facilities issues and understanding how it's going to be prioritized to me is going to be important.

start time: 577:47:59.000
end time: 577:57:11.000
confidence: 0.59
A: So.

start time: 577:58:55.000
end time: 580:06:19.000
confidence: 0.97
C: And I don't think just saying a sample, like here's a sample list, that's. That could mean we spend the money on anything.

start time: 580:15:59.000
end time: 599:27:52.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So I would, I would separate into two different pieces. I actually. We may just have a fundamental agreement. I think we owe it to the taxpayers to run the district in the most efficient and effective way possible. And I think limiting us, locking us in right now to something that, to spending money over the course of the month that may not be where it's most needed, I think would be a bad decision and that I hope voters would not support. I think the question of prioritization is an interesting and important one. I don't think it's important from a bond referral standpoint. I think it's important from an overall facility maintenance standpoint. I think it's also pretty operational. But to the extent that the board was interested in getting involved in terms of how are we prioritizing facilities, project major maintenance projects, those are certainly questions. At any time, the board, you know, could ask and really talk about that criteria, maybe something we want to do. But again, we would never, I would never want to include criteria in, say, you know, legally binding criteria in a bond. And I certainly wouldn't want to lock us into, you know, making sure we replace, you know, 10 playgrounds for $2.5 million, because that may be the highest priority when we get there, maybe the thing we should do, but, but other things may come up. And I think we need that flexibility.

start time: 599:30:16.000
end time: 625:27:10.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Director yeah, and I agree with Director Scott as well, as far as needed flexibility. You know, we're talking about some that's going to be eight to 10 years. And we really want to talk about being transparent with our community and with our, with our taxpayers. Right. You know, we are. This is a report from 2000. You know, we have $992 million worth of backlogs, which, going by the report, it's going to take us somewhere around $70 million a year just to maintain that. So we're really talking about really letting the taxpayers know what we need. But we need the $70 million a year. So that means, and I'm going to go back and say it again, 1.8 is not going to cut it. So we're really talking about what we need as a, as a district and what our kids needs. Our kids needs to be able to maintain it, because if not, we're going to be back here in a few years with other schools that are in the same predicament or we're going back to the schools that we modernize again, going back to fix those. And we don't maintain a level of deferred maintenance. 1.8 is not going to get us that level of deferred maintenance that we need. And so if we're putting it out there to the community and taxpayers, yeah, we're going to spend what we can, what we, what we got, but it's not going to be enough. And they need to know that it's not going to be enough in the overall maintenance that we need to uphold all of our facilities that we have. And so we either do something about it now or we take it down the road and we do it Maybe eight years.

start time: 625:50:50.000
end time: 629:14:10.000
confidence: 0.93
C: That's why I was a little bit surprised by the. And this gets to a future slide of the 470 that was going into modernization and like is it actually.

start time: 629:47:10.000
end time: 629:51:34.000
confidence: 0.98
E: I.

start time: 629:51:42.000
end time: 641:18:40.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Don'T like necessarily the word deferred maintenance, but like deferred maintenance priority scopes and improvements versus I mean if we have 900 million or a billion dollars worth of those. Is that what we're talking about or are you talking about actually the modernization that we, that term here appears has meant like a full rebuild versus if we have another 470 million, we actually could be potentially really good stewards and fix a lot of our systems or have modern H Vacs in all of our schools. So I'm curious, are you concluding that the 470.

start time: 641:19:20.000
end time: 642:13:04.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Let's answer that question when we get to that section of the presentation because.

start time: 642:14:32.000
end time: 645:42:56.000
confidence: 0.92
C: To me Zen is like we're operating in a time of scarcity when like three slides later it's like oh, we have 470 million. So this is our highest priority. So it's more interesting definitions when we get there.

start time: 645:44:08.000
end time: 647:04:48.000
confidence: 0.88
A: We'll get to that once you keep going. Unless there are other questions on the different maintenance, we'll have time and again to come back.

start time: 647:07:04.000
end time: 649:46:18.000
confidence: 0.91
C: And this also this, this wouldn't get us to ADA full ADA compliance because it only got has two elevators and.

start time: 649:47:14.000
end time: 653:51:54.000
confidence: 0.89
D: This sample shows two elevators, two new elevators. I had to look back at the materials from a previous meeting but to address full compliance to multi level it was somewhere north of $100 million total estimate.

start time: 653:54:02.000
end time: 655:46:34.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I think it was 100 million last bond and we put 50 something in to get all the first floors done.

start time: 655:48:02.000
end time: 663:17:20.000
confidence: 0.92
D: I need to double. Let me double check. Okay. We are going to move on to athletic improvements. In the materials is an updated sample scope for improvement to our athletic fields. It's $75 million. With me, I have Marshall Haskins, our senior director of athletics to give just a quick overview of what those funds would include and answer question two and.

start time: 664:05:10.000
end time: 707:24:00.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Coach Boyce, can you hear me? So what our improvements here listed are just to get our high schools all completed. So going back to Roosevelt and the original bond we never completed athletic fields and for five years we couldn't even use the baseball softball field. Right. So these funds would just get us covered for Frank plan for grant for Roosevelt and for West Hill and for Lincoln is just getting us done what we said we were going to do originally with those and also make sure that we've completed with the modernization of Jefferson Wells and Cleveland. We will then have all of Our high schools at a bare minimum of what we need for turf, fields and lights, we'd be able to deal with the or miss a Title 9 lawsuit that's going to be pending if we don't do it at a couple sites that namely Cleveland is already concerned about and rightfully so concerned about the distance between baseball and softball. And if we turf Powell park for baseball and softball doesn't have it. So this just gets our high school hall complete. It doesn't however, deal with the fact that any lower level teams and games are still going to be at Delta park, are still getting kids out of class because we don't have athletic cups that we own and control. But this does take care of our high schools. So in the other previous bonds, none of these things were included. Value engineering. Okay. Just wanted to make sure that it was clear that none of these was included in the last bonds. And once again, this is why what we decisions we make today is going to be so important on the amount of funds that we asked our community for. Because here we are. Roosevelt was built 10 years ago, almost something like that. Now we're back here finishing up something that happened 10 years ago. We should not make that same mistake today, 15 years later on. So when we talk about what we really need for our bonds, we have to look at not just what's going to fix it today, but also what's going to take care of 10 years from now. Because we shouldn't be coming back 10 years or 15 years from now talking about we need to do something at Lincoln, I mean at Cleveland and Ida B. Will, if it doesn't make sense at that point.

start time: 707:33:00.000
end time: 713:59:20.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I really appreciate you bringing that up, Director Holland. So my question is going to be if you go back to the three modernizations which I'm very much supportive having from the 2020 bond and then the two high schools in this bond that are proposed with the reduced amount of funds.

start time: 714:07:00.000

start time: 714:59:00.000

end time: 718:14:04.000
confidence: 0.91
C: The Cleveland amount and the materials are provided. Cleveland has a lower amount. So does target is lower, but the.

end time: 718:41:16.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Total amount for funding is the same.

start time: 718:43:48.000
end time: 719:30:36.000
confidence: 0.95
C: This is not my point. I'm trying to ask a question about athletics.

start time: 719:31:08.000
end time: 720:13:48.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I'm just saying factually, we need to be clear about what's happening.

start time: 720:16:44.000
end time: 722:36:54.000
confidence: 0.91
C: The number has been reduced from what they had before for Ida B. Wells in Cleveland, correct? No, it's now three. The proposal was three.

start time: 722:38:22.000
end time: 723:12:38.000
confidence: 0.97
A: There's a target to get it down to 360.

start time: 723:14:54.000
end time: 733:20:20.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Okay. The target, the reduction. Reduction target. I'm just trying to get my question out because I'm trying to build off of director Holland's point. And this is I think a question for you, Dan. Are the Ed spec staying the same for the athletics? So again, to avoid 10 years from now us talking about, well, we didn't include enough funds for Cleveland to get theirs done or Ida B. Wells to get their fields done. So we don't have a coming back 10 years later with a new target amount.

start time: 734:07:20.000
end time: 761:13:40.000
confidence: 0.93
D: The new target amount. So what the teams have been tasked to do is to take a look at options to reduce to those target amounts. And so that will be a process that they'll go through that will have several iterations in it. So I'll just kind of get like the process, I guess answer first. So the teams are right now going and looking at what some potential cost reduction options are. We have a third party study that might give us, that will give us some potential options to look at. They will then get stakeholder feedback on those options, I presume before it comes to the board. So there's some sense of what the stakeholders who have been a part of the process to date, if there are changes, what the stakeholder community, staff, students, what their input is on those changes, then there will be a cost estimating, a formal cost estimating effort and then ultimately a presentation to the board of the committee and then an approval. So that's the process that we are embarking on now. I would say where we're targeting is where do we see deltas between what other projects were before or other projects that are out there. Where can we look at potential reductions such as reducing to code requirements and not exceeding code requirements. Potentially looking at the Ed specs, what the Ed spec minimums are and not above ED spec minimums. Those are some where expect to see some square footage come. But the goal is to retain as much program as possible focusing on what that student experience is. So there isn't a directive to say reduce here or reduce athletics. It's going to be what are the best potential options that we get feedback on that could reduce these projects.

start time: 761:52:40.000
end time: 774:20:52.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So when we get to the end or when we get to the actual modernization projects, like to have a specific conversation about the ED specs and sort of the basic what are the fundamentals and whether those are in play or not. So that just. And some of them might be the right thing to do. Put some things in play and other ones we're like, no, we've told all the high school communities to get those. So at some point I'd like to have that conversation because I just think we should all understand if we're going to reduce scope, if it's reducing scope from something that's over the EDSPECs down to the ED SPECs or we're not doing an ED SPEC and are we okay with that?

start time: 774:22:36.000

A: Thank you.

end time: 818:16:00.000
confidence: 0.97
G: I appreciate the question. So I just want to jump in here just to add that I appreciate the emphasis from Director Scott because of the number that I think folks hold on to that's apply to the high schools are numbers that were established or at least talked about before we even had a design. I mean, that's just like saying that, hey, this is this, you know, 500 million dollar mark that you have now go and create and then you create something and it only costs like 350 million. And then folks are like, oh, but what about the reductions? We lost this, this and this. Well, it's not that it was lost, it's that it was a pretty big number to start with. And I think just bringing back in the earlier point, there's no high school that's built in the state of Oregon, on the west coast, across the United states for over 450 million for a single high school site. And so while we definitely believe that our numbers were significant and enough to be able to plan for a high school, I believe that it was an inflated number. And I think that we have information that will tell us in the coming weeks of why that number was inflated. I believe that we can build schools for less than that based on what we're seeing happen around the map. And to Director Scott's point, if there are some things we know that there might be a change in costs, there might be some inflation, we still have a bucket of funds that can be applied if, let's say maybe we're shooting for 366 and it comes out at 380 or 390. But to the date, there's no high school that's been built in Portland for even close to 400 million. And that includes Benson when you remove High U campus from it. So I just wanted to just emphasize and reiterate that there is one bucket of funds for modernization and I believe that Jefferson, Cleveland and Ida B. Wells will be big, will be beautiful, will be built for 1700 and have all the things that the community and teachers desire and still not be at that number. Because we do need to make sure that we're building in an audacious way and making sure that we have the ability to heat our buildings when we need to, and we can cool them when we need to, and we can continue to care and maintain them along the way. And the only way to do that is to be mindful of the ways in which we spend funds for our schools.

F: I think that's what I wanted to make sure that I was chiming in, just getting back to Dan, to follow up on. Was that the request that I had or when I brought up saying that I'd like to do a construction audit, it was not to say that I want us to look at how we can get the cost down. My concern was, after talking with builders and superintendents and project managers across the country from a lot of these conferences that I've been going to, thank you for allowing me to go to these conferences. It allows me to ask a lot of questions, hard questions, that we were doing everything backwards, that we were coming in and saying that this is our number. Now go build a school to this number. And nowhere else in the country are they doing that. When I talk to the different ones across the country, what I'm finding is that they say, we want a school. And then an architectural firm comes in and they say, this is what it's going to take. This is what the school is going to look like. They draft up some stuff. They work with community, different ones, whoever else. You get them all involved, and they say, this is what the school is going to look like. And then they work with a project manager or a construction manager, who then in turn says, okay, is this school actually buildable? Can we build this school that y'all have actually done? And then they do that. And then after they have decide found out that yes, we can build this school, then it goes to a general contractor. And the general contractor actually builds the school that the architectural firm has designed. And when the architectural firm designs it, they also lay out, this is how much a school should cost, that building into this. This is what it should cost. And then they go out and they do it. What we've been doing is saying, okay, we got X amount of money, and then go build us a school, but come in as low as you can. I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that at all. I'm getting all the money that I can possibly get out of you. If you come and tell me, you know what I'm saying, you tell me I got 460 million to build a.

F: 480 because I think I can pull from and then that's just me. And I know if I'm thinking that then every other contractor out there in the world is thinking that and they try to get that money. And Portland so far has been the place where you get your bag. And so what I'm trying to say is I want us to look at a full on construction audit to say are we doing it the right way? Now if we say if we do everything that we're doing and I feel like it should be doing from out the duns from outside because I don't even the way that we've done it right now we've got our construction manager and our general contractor are all in the same pot and there's no checks and balances. So now they can get change order done and they say oh yeah, we need it. And then they go ahead because we need it. And then it's all done because they're all part of the same household and you know, they all eat at the same Christmas table and I know we got a wall up in between us and so we try to subdivide ourselves but at the end of the day you still my cousin and so I'm gonna make sure that you eat. And so I'm thinking that is that the right way? Because nowhere else in the states is doing that across the country, not even in Oregon. Most other Oregon schools and places that are built, they separate the general contractor from the construction manager or the project manager. And I know there's a space, a time and a place where you can say, well it makes it ease the convenience of trying to get stuff done. But do we need that ease or do we need it right? And so I'm looking for checks, balances and accountability. And that's what this audit was supposed to do. Not come back and say, okay, we're gonna look at how we can reduce the scope, get it down so we can get it at this cost. Even saying that we're doing it the wrong way, I think we need the audit to say are we doing it the correct way? Should we be allowing the architectural firm to set it? And then if they come back and they say it's gonna cost 500 million, well then it is what it is. Go get the money. Let's figure out how to get it done and let's fix it. But without doing that, I think we're out of line. And I think that's why I'm saying that's where I thought we were at. That's what I thought this was about. So to hear that, it's just, you know, we've been tasked to figure out how we can do it for less. That's not what I was tasking. I was never asking nobody to do that. I said do a construction audit, tell us what we're. If what we're doing is the right way and should we be doing it different. I did not say go reduce it to 360, because if we can get it done for two, then get it done for two. But if it's going to cost us four, then spend four. I just want to know that we're doing it the right way. And I think the community, I think that's what they want to know. And so that's what I sit with.

C: That before we leave this athletics improvement slide. Dan, I'm going to go back to your answer. I think your answer was maybe on whether Cleveland and Ida B. Wells, that would be included. I mean, you described a long process, but it wasn't like, yes, what we've got in now is what's going to end up. I don't want to mischaracterize you, but I didn't hear, I didn't hear clear one way or the other. But it's like, there'll be a process, but it wasn't like, yes, for sure, it would still be in.

D: I'm trying to be more clear. I don't know what exactly the process the outcome is going to be. What I do anticipate is it's going to provide options to say, here are. Let's make a menu, but here are some cost reduction options that get you to a number and maybe that's your target and maybe not. And also there's going to be an option that says, here's how to get to your number and that might be deeper cuts than what you want. So maybe you want to go back to the larger number. Does that make sense? We're not being prescriptive of saying just get there.

C: This is going to go back to. I guess my question I have about just general ed specs that we can touch on later, but because they're one of many specifications we have. So my other question is, I had proposed last week a $97 million package which had the 75 million in and then plus it had funds for partial funds for the hubs with some money for Jackson not doing the full hub build out. I mean, they're pretty expensive, but enough that there would be Spaces for swing athletics for Ida B. Wells. And then my understanding was Marshalls would be the Franklin overflow and that there's discussions happening with Concordia, which would be the sort of northeast quadrant. And I'm just curious about if we don't. If the decision made is not to make those investments. They're not in this current. Like are you saying that that means students are going to Delta Park? Probably, yes.

start time: 932:20:36.000

confidence: 0.94
E: We'll still be at Delta Park. We'll still be leaving school early. We'll still be going to North Clackamas for softball games in the middle of the day. We'll still be doing some of those things.

E: Wells and Ida B. Wells? That's conundrum we're gonna have to figure out. We were able to move Lincoln to Wells going Lincoln's moderation between Wells actually had a practice field, a stadium and rinky. Well right now if that's offline, then we're going to be like literally Lincoln also went to Marshall at 8 o'clock to practice lacrosse. I mean that's the kind of stuff that we're going to have to do if we don't do some type of overflow at Jackson, which would be the nearest place for them. And I usually there's dollars in the bonds worth for. What's my word? Swing swing site. Julie, I would like. Director Brehm, I'd like to go back to the other question about will athletics be taken care of versus not taking care of. When we get to the value engineering, looking at past experiences, lessons learned. We just want to make sure they're in the scope. When they're in the scope, they haven't been value engineered out. When they have not been in the scope, meaning board approved prior to. They have always been value engineered out. So I would just ask that we make sure they're in the scope, which then gets to the conversation that dad's talking about. When you get to discuss what we're going to do or not do. I just want to. If we're at the table, I feel confident. Well, I feel the communities that will be impacted will be there to have a voice to advocate for what they think their communities need.

And we have a robust 6,000 kids that are participating. We're anticipating adding some additional OSA sports like lacrosse, which will be added. We're adding boys volleyball. We'll be adding girls black football. And right now we're going to probably say no. And we don't have the space to offer those things.

confidence: 0.95
C: It'S like if you try and go there after school, it's impossible and it's just not. You know, it also relies on some kids having cars and parents, you know, not being able to go to games. I mean, and they're missing school. It's just not a great option if we're concerned about instructional time because you've got to leave really early. So I would hope. And again, I don't know. I mean, and we have to. If we're going to move ahead with Ida B. Wells. We can't just say you're not going to have athletics for two years. So somehow we have to have some solution.

start time: 1006:00:00.000
end time: 1027:56:10.000
confidence: 0.91
E: Could I just offer one other thought too? Is the reality is we have schools that are trying. They're figured out on their own. And so we talk about the inequities across our system. I have a school that runs Hillsborough Stadium for baseball because they don't have baseball in their Community. Right. We have other schools that are renting all kind of places to utilize for athletics because they don't have it within their community. And then it does become a habit of have not when some schools are playing on turf and some schools are not playing on turf. When you look at the success or failure of sports of our league and places athletes full athletics facilities, their teams just do better because they have more opportunity to practice. People that can afford to go to hitting facilities, their baseball softball teams are better than the ones who don't. It's pretty simple that they're hitting all year versus teams that can only hit when it's not raining outside. So it is also an equity issue that you have an opportunity to address by maintaining the pond and then make sure making sure it's in the scope for the new builds and then up to the number so we'd be able to provide what we need across our district.

start time: 1028:01:10.000
end time: 1033:21:50.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Can I just ask a really quick question before you move on, Director Haskins? I heard a comment about our facilities being used to generate funds. So whether the existing fields that we have now or even the start of some hubs or any of the sites that we have now incomes generating or is that the plan in the future?

start time: 1033:29:30.000
end time: 1048:03:46.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Well, I think the answer is yes and yes. So yes, there are some because in civic use of buildings they do generate revenue. I think that by having more fields, especially the hubs and then at hitting cages, I mean there's districts that are doing 2 to $300,000 a year just on hitting facilities. Not will we get that if we have nine? No, but we might get 100,000 each one easily. You know, and then whether that's me then convincing that those dollars go directly athletics, I don't know. But I think they certainly will come into the conference for us to be able to use turf fills, we would be able to rent every hour available that we're not using it between 6 and 10 every single night for soccer. Guaranteed if we had turf fields.

start time: 1048:05:38.000

We've had some deeper conversations with vendor partners to get to where we are. And it is a 46 million reduction to give that money back to the bonds. So I think that's what we heard, we listened and we have reacted. The first One is the ERP modernization, which you know about our 15 or, excuse me, 25 plus year system that needs to be replaced. And this 38 million is for that full business modernization. Staffing devices.

We've been working on it for our past couple of bonds. But this bond gets us to the final place of having access points in every classroom, cooling in our data centers and of course the continuance of cybersecurity to prevent us from having attacks.

One of the things we're also discussing is district wide cell phone policy restrictions which students wouldn't have access to the phones and currently in the classrooms they're often used for curriculum.

end time: 1144:11:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: We have been over the last six years averaging over 5%. So we need to fix that. We need to put processes and guidelines in place that will help our teachers. We're going to be partnering more with our schools to provide that in house protection. We have been buying more carts for students that don't want to take devices home. We've been doing that in middle schools. We're partnering more with the Office of Teaching and Learning. Since we don't have a homework policy, is there a need for the device to go home? The more that the device stays in the cart, the safer it will be. And if it needs to go home, there's certainly a process to check that device out. But we will need help from our schools and from our parents to make sure that we're protecting and keeping our devices safe. So to answer the question, it's yes, we will have that cell phone policy.

So the spec is when we're doing the office of School Modernization modernizing buildings, our closets don't have these, our data closets. So to protect the investment of putting in network switches and routers, this is what's required. If we don't have it, there's degradation of this equipment the minute that we put it in because our temperatures get well above triple digits.

But it's a really important thing you're moving forward on and one of those as you mentioned, sort of a bedrock of any large organization. As you know, I don't need to tell you they're also extremely high risk with more than 50% failure in the public sector of ERP projects. I won't be here to receive the report. I would encourage the superintendent to provide the board with quarterly status updates. I'm sure you've got, you know, quality assurance contractors and others. So I don't even think it necessarily needs to be, you know, presentations. But just making sure the board is regularly receiving status updates on where that project is can just make sure that that executive level support, that's one of the biggest reasons for failure is when you lose that executive level support or you have some sort of transition. And so I would just encourage you all to do that. And good luck.

B: All right. Good evening. Moving on to curriculum. The proposal that you have in front of you Tonight is for 56 million for curriculum. This is for 7 million over eight years in support of curriculum adoptions. Really, there are four key points to make here. Emphasizing the 7 million a year, emphasizing a new schedule that stretches out core adoptions in part one and part two. So rather than approaching an adoption as a K12 adoption, with this level of funding, we would stretch it over two years. And so it's a unique approach allowable within ODE's cycle and adoptions. Am I loud enough?

start time: 1208:38:30.000
end time: 1208:47:42.000
confidence: 0.48
A: Okay.

start time: 1208:48:46.000
end time: 1208:57:50.000
confidence: 0.76
E: Okay, great.

start time: 1208:58:30.000
end time: 1226:04:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Thank you. And so what it does is it takes the postponement that is allowable two years after each scheduled curriculum content. And it says, you know, we're saying, we're naming, that will be within the allowable six year range of an adoption cycle. And then using those two years of a postponement, which we do need to name that with ODE every time we do that, but it does keep us in compliance. And so again, what that stretching out does is takes a K5 in one year, a 612 in another year. And this funding level is not intending for bond funds to be the sole funding source. It gives a really strong foundation for the curriculum work and it would require some immediate reductions and also allow for us to maintain compliance with ODE's curriculum cycle as it's outlined. So those are the high points.

start time: 1226:49:30.000

A: Questions on curriculum.

start time: 1227:33:30.000
end time: 1244:50:10.000
confidence: 0.94
C: So I, I submitted some. Well, first of all, I'm going to also say the first number we had, I think last spring was something like 300 million. So good job also of scoping down, like, what is it that we need to do? I asked a series of questions and I appreciate the answers that were provided over the last couple days and board members should have those in your inbox. I have a couple questions just about the curriculum. We have probably more DLI dual language immersion programs than I think any other district in the state. Or at least there's a diversity of the languages offered. And it looks like when I asked what because noted that we had some pretty significant translation costs that. Am I reading the answer correctly? That the run rate for the cost of curricula adoption adds 30% onto our overall adoption costs.

start time: 1244:51:30.000
end time: 1253:30:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: It has historically. So when we adopt curriculum, it's common for materials to include a translation to Spanish. It is very uncommon for materials that are provided to include a translation to Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Vietnamese, which are our DLI programs. And so those costs have been very significant. Our teams are working really hard on strategizing and looking at ways to bring that down. That is a unique cost for us currently.

start time: 1253:36:30.000
end time: 1281:30:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: That's a lot for the number of on a per student basis to have it be up to 30%. And then the other question I had and there was the bond audit that we got for the 2022 year had just I think the initial review of the 2020 bond curriculum investments. And I'm wondering if there's any learnings from that because we actually in 2020, for the first time ever, because it hadn't been allowed before, we're allowed to use bond funds for curriculum. And so we put a lot of more money than we've ever spent in 30 years, put 50 million, 53 million in and then it ended up being about another 20 million. And a question I have and I don't we're having our bottom meeting or the audit meeting on the 16th. But whether we have looked at other districts like to comply. Every other district in the state has to should be trying to comply with the curriculum adoption schedule the state has. And lots of districts don't have local, local options or bonds. And so how do we, you know, how do we compare other districts actually just like we're not could comply and we're just out of, you know, Division 22 out of compliance or are they complying and they have a more cost effective way to do it. And I don't know if we've done that. I haven't seen us do that research.

start time: 1281:30:50.000
end time: 1319:58:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: But I we have a memo linked with some comparisons and things so I can make sure that you have access to that. So just to talk to a couple of really high points, you know, my time in PPS is pretty short, but having been on the curriculum and instruction advisory committee of home mult Loma county for about a decade, really this is something all districts struggle with. Right. So it lands within the budgeting process. So whether a district opts to do that within the general fund, oftentimes there's an approach of creating a special revenue fund where if there should be an ending fund balance, money is tucked away in that over time. That's a pretty standard approach. There are a few districts in the state that do run a bond that does support buildings and curriculum. That really is very few districts. As We've heard from Dr. Armstrong over time this is A problem all districts are faced with. So it's a matter of the budgeting process. I think you had some other questions in there as well. How do districts accomplish this? They start with a per pupil dollar amount or an allocation. What we're doing uniquely so is we're budgeting out many, many years right into that bigger number. It was many, many years. But what my team and I do is look at, at least over this last short while is we look at the actual enrollment for that grade. We look at the projected cost. So a text, in and of itself, they run at least 150. You know, it depends on the content area. Many vendors, this is a big money piece. So our vendors also are charging digital costs and tax costs. Sometimes they won't do a text cost in isolation. That question has come up as well. Could we only do text costs? So I think to answer your question, I mean, we all are faced with the same dilemma. How do we provide a per pupil dollar amount? That also really brings in our teacher voice when we're selecting materials for the materials that they really see fit for our students. There also are costs for teacher additions. Those are quite expensive as well. And so when we enter into an adoption, we're looking at, sure, what's a reasonable rate? And then all these other pieces do come into play. As you've asked some questions about tonight.

start time: 1320:01:10.000
end time: 1341:21:44.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I appreciate you bringing up the digital versus the textbooks because my kids were in school and my entire time on the board up until I think last year, we've never been in compliance on current adoptions until until now, which is great. I mean, it's good for our students. We know that having high quality curriculum materials is great. But I also look at. I mean, this is sort of a similar question that the superintendent's asking about the high schools. Like, are we doing it the most? Are we getting what this we need for the most cost effective way? And. And it just again seems like a lot of money then that ODE is actually requiring districts to spend with their adoption cycles that they don't necessarily then provide the resources for districts to do that. But I think I would want to see an. I don't. I'm not seeing in the Q and A. I'm not seeing an answer, a link to the comparisons, but I can get that after the meeting. But I would like to just benchmark again, say Beaverton, Hillsborough, Salem, just, you know, are we within range? And again, are we comparable? Because if they're not complying and we are, then it's not a surprise that we're spending more money.

start time: 1341:24:32.000
end time: 1353:41:10.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Yeah, I think we can get that answer. I think just to wrap up is I appreciate you, Director Bremm Edward, highlighting the reduction from both curriculum and technology. It's not that the need has just been, you know, miraculously reduced, but it's the commitment from the leadership team to say that every opportunity we have to put money into our buildings, into our facilities, we're going to take. And so over the eight years, we are going to have to think creatively about. About how we make up the difference for both curriculum and technology while also still moving on some of our goals for facilities. But I think we can respond later to the other questions.

G: Well, it absolutely should be. I appreciate the question because the way in which the materials that we need to educate our students shouldn't be a taxpayer's burden. It should be something that we handle as a school district. But we also know in this time that we're in with competing resources and needs, it's going to take us a little bit of time to be able to build up that reserve fund that Tobin mentioned. Sorry, I just want to just call her by her first name that Joanna mentioned. But yes, the goal is to be able to handle general fund or to apply general fund dollars to our curriculum needs. But in the state of Oregon, we are obviously allowed to use bond dollars for technology and curriculum. So we're able to utilize that and resource our district in ways that we wouldn't be able to in any other way.

confidence: 0.95
B: Right. So the areas that are included in the adoption cycle are. That would be often considered electives would be world language, visual and performing arts and physical Education, we usually consider that core. Now those areas do not have the same. It depends on how we approach it. What are our values, what are our beliefs, what do we want to enter into? They typically do not have a text. Sometimes there are some open source example of pe, there's some open source materials. Our bond allows for durable items to be purchased. Sometimes our items are consumable if they're not intended to last beyond say five years. So there's some complexities there.

start time: 1399:21:58.000

D: Thanks. My friends up here go back to their seats and I want to invite Stormy Shanks, who's the senior director of Obstacle Modernization to join me to help answer questions if I can. I'll take just a minute to do some context about. I thought I threw this slide in here at the last minute just to provide some context around modernizations, how designs and cost estimates, how they're developed. And I think this will help some of the conversation about when we talk about reimagining the high schools. And so hopefully this is somewhat linear and makes sense, but this is very quickly and high level. Our modernization projects, ostensibly our high schools, not just our high schools, things like Kellogg and Foppian. Some of the really their design decisions started a decade ago with these guiding documents. So district has adopted guiding documents over a long period of time, the education specifications being primary, but there are others as well. As we have design standards, we have district policy, all those sort of things which are the guiding documents that we call them and those inform the design before there is even a design. So then we move into our first phase of pre designed but comprehensive planning. And I think most of the board is familiar with comprehensive planning. All of our high schools go through this process, usually takes about six months. It's the first time that the guidance documents, along with the existing conditions of the site, as well as input from stakeholder staff, students, community partners, etc. That becomes a site specific design high level. And that is the first time we get an initial project estimate from a third party professional construction cost estimator. So that is when the budgets for the project are first set. Prior to that they're very parametric. It's dollars per square foot times an assumed square foot, like that sort of thing. So the comprehensive plan is the first time that we get that third party cost estimate. The comprehensive plans are of course approved by the board which really establish the scope, the schedule and budget for those projects. Then they move on into the formal design phases. The formal design has three primary schematic, design, design development, and then contract documents. We get updated cost estimates from those third party cost estimators at each one of those phases. So the point being, I guess that as the designs progress, we get updated cost estimates from professional cost estimators and that's what forms our budgets and what our designs are. So hopefully that's helpful. And then just. And we note that the community and stakeholder engagement is involved all along that timeline. So hopefully that provides some context. Happy to answer questions. I'll go back to our gradually scheduled topic for our modernizations. I'll jump around notes because we've talked about a little bit of this already. The teams, the three modernization high school teams have been tasked with kind of reimagining the projects to align with the target budgets noted here. Since those project costs are based on the latest designs and the designs are based on district standards shaped by that stakeholder feedback, it will be important that we revisit these and consider these previous decisions through this effort and this will be a process. So the design teams are developing concepts and action plans right as we speak. And it's early, but I anticipate we'll go through the iterative steps that I mentioned before developing initial cost saving options. So really high level, what are these potential options? What might they look like? Gaining feedback from stakeholders on those options, designing and then cost estimating, get that third party independent cost estimate of what those redesigns look like, presenting to the board or the committee, whatever that process might be, and ultimately approval to proceed as shown. So that's how we see this process going that we talked about earlier. As shown or talked about before, the savings could go to modernizing middle schools and elementary schools. And the idea of modernizing these schools after high schools are completed has been discussed conceptually for a long time, but not with a lot of detail. Specific schools and scopes have not been determined and many decisions that need to be made prior to proceeding with the middle school or elementary school include selection criteria, identifying the criteria for which future schools would be selected for modernization. And that criteria could include a number of things including school type, facility condition, educational program needs, availability of temporary housing, enrollment, location, demographics, costs, etc. So there's probably going to be a lot of potential criteria that would then, once those are established, point to which school or schools would be modernized. And then as director Paramount's brought up what is that scope of work? We use the word Modernization pretty loosely, but generally means our high schools. We're going to build new construction and we're going to really fully renovate them to an almost essentially new standard. That is not, it can be what happens with future modernizations of other schools, but it can also be something else. It can also be more targeted at investing in those critical facility improvements or other scopes of work or something in between those. So those are decisions that would need to be made before we moved on. And then of course, what is that decision making process? These are big decisions. What's the process that results in those decisions? Those decisions of course being made. And considering the amount of work that we have Based with the 2020 authorization and what is contemplated here in the 2025 authorization, work on those monetizations is probably quite a bit out. So I think we have time to design those processes, make those decisions, have that feedback, or in that narrative process.

confidence: 0.96
G: And then just to add to that, as we also, to your point, need to hear what the final cost would be for both Ida B. Wells and Cleveland before even naming elementary and middle schools. Because while we are hoping for 470, once we get the final cost, it could be significantly less. So that's one of the reasons why we're not yet at a place of wanting to name specific sites when we still have two high schools that are being costed out.

confidence: 0.92
D: Yeah, I think that's a fair. Where we are now, I think that's kind of a fair way to category. Whereas a full modernization means we're basically doing everything.

And you know, I think what we're doing here is saying we might need that money for the remaining three high schools, but we hope we can do the remaining three high schools and a number of other projects. And I actually think that's a, that's a really positive step forward. I think it's a much, it's a much better bond as a result of that and allow it for that flexibility. I think when we talk about criteria, I absolutely don't think we should be naming schools because that's just setting expectations without adequate knowledge. I do think figuring out and talking and being able to talk about what the criteria might be and whether it's reflecting, referring back to our facility condition assessments or other criteria that you currently use to prioritize projects and being really clear with the community that to the extent that money is not needed for the three high schools, to the extent we can spend that money on available, you know, on elementary and middle schools, this is the process that the district would go through. These are the types of criteria we would look at, at sort of that Broadway and then also building in some accountability that probably comes back to the board, maybe with our Bond audit committee, etc. Or with community involvement as well, because it is years out.

A: If this board refers this package and the voters approve it, we're not coming back, you know, to spend this money on those elementary, middle schools for two years. Right. And so there's time not just to work out the specifics, but also to do a lot of that community engagement. I think that's where it could be a real sound point that, you know, this is not a, it's not a black box. But we also can't define it. I mean, honestly, a little bit like the center for Black Student Excellence, right? I mean, it's a process that's still ongoing, but we're doing co creation with the community around it to figure out what we need to do and I could see a similar vision for these potential dollars if they do, if they do come to fruition. Okay, questions on voters.

C: So one just fundamental question I would have if we had 470 million and we're not going to, or even 400 million and we're not going to use it for years to come, wouldn't one possibility be we shorten the bond and save money on interest and then when we go out for the next bond, after we've done all the community planning, I don't know that we've done. And again, depends on what your definition of modernization. But we've never, we've never done modernizations where there's not a whole host of process before the bond referral. I mean, all the schools, every school that we've modernized has been specifically named in the bond. And so just a question is, if we, if we had that money and we're not going to do that for years later, it seems like from a taxpayer's standpoint and just the community standpoint is like, well, then why don't you put that in the next bond? And.

G: Absolutely. So we don't. We're still, I mean, it would be unfortunate to give that back when we're still in the process of costing out Ida B. Wells in Cleveland until that design is complete. Like, I know it's our expectation team's expectation. My expectation is that it's one bond per building that we're not, you know, having some amount. And then because we didn't ask for enough, we got to now wait for another bond to be able to finish off Cleveland or ida B.

C: $470 million is a lot to have in flux. So I'll go to like another issue that just a question I have. So going through the materials. So from the very start of this last spring, I strongly support finishing the modernization of our high schools. We made that commitment to the community. We're going to do it. And this bond has the ability to complete the high schools. The proposed cuts for me need a lot more clarity before we have the referral. And one of the set of questions that I ask, it said that we might not get the data back till after the referral. And I just think that's not the responsible. I mean, for me, we should have that before we do the referral versus and again, we having a process in which we refer and then we're going to come back and say what's in the project and what's out and how much it's going to cost is not the sequential process we've used in the past. And I think it makes it harder frankly to sell to the voters because there's confusion then about what is it that we're asking them to fund. Are we asking them to fund a full ED spec with everything we did for Grant and Lincoln and McDaniels? Are we asking them for a smaller project and how they feel about that? And I feel like we have to have that before we refer. And so in the documents it said that would be probably done by the end of January. So I know nobody wants to wait until the end of January, but to me that is like an essential component that we're like, we actually know what we're asking the voters to approve because it's a lot of money.

G: So I'm curious about that and maybe Dan has a question. But I think our belief is that it's ED specs built to 1700 and all the things that were previously listed. So I'm not sure about the reduction.

start time: 1638:59:40.000
end time: 1641:04:36.000

C: For the high school modernizations? My understanding, and I'm trying to look at three different documents and I can't link the link to the ED specs doesn't work. But if you. In the essence of questions, it says we'll know what those reductions are, what the reductions in the target, what they look like, where do we get those from by the end of January? Isn't that what the.

start time: 1648:37:10.000
end time: 1653:47:00.000
confidence: 0.92
D: What we are hoping is the teams are just starting to look at this process. So we're hoping to get some initial feedback by the end of January, but we're not going to have time to get community engagement and then to be able to do redesign, get third party cost estimating by the end of January.

start time: 1654:16:00.000

C: Just my personal opinion. Having passed for 25 years of passing bonds and local options, it's challenging to say to put the largest bond in state history on the ballot with a we don't yet know what the project looks like. And the expectation usually is that for all the Cleveland and Ida B. Wells people here is usually those communities provide most of the volunteers a lot of the financial support. And if we don't know what the project looks like, I think that is really challenging to run a successful ballot campaign and to get support. I mean, if we're going to get all the ED specs and everything, it's like I didn't hear you say even when I asked about the athletics. So if it's like we're going to get smaller science classrooms or not as much square footage in the counseling offices, or we're going to have 100% utilization. And we find that out after we refer, because that's how we get the cost versus, like, I'm with Director Green here, if, like, we can make the contractors, you know, a better process where we get a more competitive price or something, that's great. But if it's. We're actually reducing or changing or limiting the ED specs, which it sounds like those.

G: So my expectation is that we're going to have three schools built over the next four years that are at specs built for 1700 and that will have all the bells and whistles that all the other schools, if not. Yeah. With some of the things we're doing with fields that we didn't do with the prior projects.

C: When I asked over the weekend, I didn't get a direct answer, like, if we're doing all the ED specs and that's not changing, then that should be clearly communicated. But even when I ask about the fields, it was, maybe there's a community process where the community decides that's a lesser priority than adequate CTE space. I mean, Roosevelt's a great example of like, not adequate cte. It got value, native engineered some ED specs. And that's why then we set a new set of standards after the 2012 bond where Franklin and Roosevelt got some stuff valued engineered out, is that we set new standards. And as long as the commitment from the superintendent is that again, I asked this weekend and I didn't get, I wasn't sure what the answer is. And so I'm just looking for clarity.

end time: 1712:54:50.000
confidence: 0.95
G: No, I appreciate that. I could definitely say that ED specs is our guiding document, but with like the DAG group, if I think we talked earlier about, like, health facility being in the plans and if the design group has made some other proposals and that recommendation was accepted through the design process and they wanted to go a whole different direction. I mean, you know, that's an aspect, but, you know, are we required to have it or do we lean on the design group to elevate some of those things?

start time: 1713:13:10.000
end time: 1730:17:40.000
confidence: 0.95
C: The ED specs were set up so that we have equitable high schools across the district. And if we change them or we said they're going to be different. I think there's equity issues because, for example, historically said, like, hey, the kids in that part of town, they're all going to college, so they don't need cte. So we're gonna like dial up the CTE at these schools but not the other ones. And with the ED specs we tried to say no matter what high school you're at, you're gonna have similar academic spaces, library space, counseling space, health clinics so that it no matter what high school you're at, you would have access to that. And so it wasn't like the design advisory group could say hey, we decided to build the high school for 2200 versus 1700 or we're going to build it for 1400.

confidence: 0.89
D: To answer corrector my members question I'll just note that the ED specs well in all the schools exceed and specs to date in some areas and then don't meet in other areas largely because of existing conditions. Aspects also are a range where there's required and there's preferred. And so one of the things we're asking the team to do is more focus on the required than the preferred. And are there things that we're above the standard or above the specification or even where we're above code requirements? Are those things that we can take a look at and find some cost.

A: Reductions Directive remoters I want to ask a. It seemed like you were, you said you wanted to finish the high schools and it seemed like in prior meetings you were comfortable referring a bond that had 450 or 460 million dollars per high school. So I'm struggling a little to understand why a bond package that still has funding for all those things but also talks about a process we're going to go through that could create more room for additional projects is a negative.

start time: 1747:02:50.000
end time: 1771:46:56.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I started with a statement so that people would understand because there has been a discussion like should we put all the money into the high school? So I want to just lay out I'm supportive of having all the high schools in because if we go back to the initial conversation, it wasn't that there wasn't necessarily agreement that we were going to put all the high schools in. So I'm just starting with that assumption and I'm four since I'm a taxpayer, have been one for a long time at PPS that we have the most cost effective schools. I also believe that we should be clear with the community about what it is that we're buying because what I don't want to. I don't think what you want to have happen is yeah, the campaign said that, but really the district is doing this and so this Is like getting the, like what exactly is it that we're doing so that people understand what's in or out? So den having the ed of which are the required ones, I think super helpful to the community. Like you're gonna get this because everybody's required. Here's where, like if you want a performing arts theater that's slightly smaller because you want to go long on something else that's preferred, that's also good to know. But I think the more clarity we can provide the school communities before the referral and before we ask people to vote, the more successful we will be and the better we will be in terms of a district with credibility with our broader community.

Whether we can find, you know, $100 million from these projects or not. It's going to give us some directions, you know, to look at. But I'm going to come back to the overall. I mean, I think we as a district have responsibility to move this forward.

A: This is, you know, been a very, very slow process. Just as a reminder, we were planning to refer this bond in November. We decided not to for a variety of, of reasons, but we've been talking about for a very long time. And actually the overall package hasn't changed that much. It has changed based on feedback from board members, based on feedback from the public as we settled in. But for quite a while now we've had these same criteria from previous meetings from the board around, you know, 1.5 to 1.8 billion, an eight year, you know, amount, you know, finishing the high schools, adding the other things that we can. I think continued delay puts Cleveland and Walls at risk. And to be really blunt, we need to be referring this. We should have referred in December. I don't see any reason why we haven't been able to. But I think as we continue to move forward, we need to refer it as quickly as we can so we can get a campaign up and running and get this done in May. I think the more, the longer we wait, the more we risk missing May or potentially not being able to mount a strong campaign if we do it too late, if we miss May and go to November, it's actually going to cost the district tens of millions of dollars as we delay wells in Cleveland projects and have to wait for that bond. So there's a. There's a very strong package here, and I'm going to continue to push back on what I see as really blatant mischaracterization of a reduction in funding for these high schools. And I don't know if that mischaracterization is coming from certain board members. I don't know if it's coming from the public. But this package says we're going to spend the exact same amount on modernizations as we were going to spend like last week and the week before. What we are also going to do is scrub these numbers and spend dollars in a way that I think taxpayers will reward us for. And honestly, if we've referred to $450 million high school projects, that in and of itself could have potentially put the bond in danger, because I think people would have rightfully asked, what are you spending all that money on? And so this moves us in a really positive direction around accountability, transparency, efficiency around the project. And I'm just. I'm concerned about this continued delay on. Well, I would just say I'm not feeling. I'm concerned about a continued delay around this and, And. And the possibility that it's going to put it all at risk. I do want to open this up to other board members.

Our job as a board, as publicly elected representatives, is to oversee the use of this budget. So our use of this bond, a. It hasn't even passed yet. So let's also be clear about that. We don't have this money. We need to do everything to make this successful. One really quick question. I mean, just, I want to reiterate, you know, to be absolutely clear. I mean, 360 million would put these schools as the most expensive schools in our district. Correct?

confidence: 0.96
D: And it has room to. If there's need. Right. The bond is allocated $1.15 billion. So if it needs to go above, there's that option. But the goal is to try to get the same school for less money so that we have more money for others. I mean, just kind of give you some perspective. Right. Like, Kellogg was done for $40 million.

confidence: 0.94
D: And we're talking about, like, to re. To redo H vac systems in elementary or middle schools, somewhere around 10,000 to 20 million. So, I mean, if we can save $100 million, that's. That's five schools that get new H vac systems. Right. One thing I would maybe would be nice to see from an accountability standpoint, because it is our job to kind of oversee this project, make sure the money is used well, and it may also help with the campaign is. And I know we're waiting on this report and there's been a lot of work done in the district, but to maybe give examples of some priorities. Right. Like as we identify, say, like, you know, we do have, like, these elementary schools or these middle schools that are a priority we want to get to within two years. It would be nice to have that identified and obviously with some flexibility, because, you know that I think that part is important for accountability, but that also a reminder that's an ongoing process. That's something that we do throughout our whole term here and after May. So thank you.

F: Thank you. So I want to make sure that I get these out when we start thinking about modernization. And I know we had asked about the audit. We were told that we were going to get the audit in the first parts of November, then it was moved to the last part of November, and now we're being told that it's going to take more time. So I'd like to get if we can figure out how we're going to wrap that up because we're continuing to move forward on the idea of let's get this construction done without having the construction audit. And I'm concerned that in PPS delay means denial. And I think that's the concern from some of the community and other people, which is why we're pushing to. We want to make sure that we name Cleveland, that we name Ida B. Wells, that we name these specific things is because our history has shown and I'm a part of this now and I'm on it. So I have to eat it, I have to bear it. I have to wear that way that when we put stuff off is because we're trying to. We're just push it down, we'll push it down and eventually they'll forget about it and we'll move on to the next thing. So I'd like to if we can put a button on when this audit is going to come back, because it doesn't even make sense to me that we can continue to move forward with the same practice in which we're doing things. If the audit is supposed to be looking at the whole process and determining whether or not are we using best practice or not. So with that, I'd like to know is the audit going to identify, because we got all these people that are working and doing different things. Will the audit identify the number of people that we have that are being paid by bond dollars? So is there a number? Is it five people, six people, seven? Like how many people are being. How many staff members are being paid by the bond? And so I'd like to know if the audit is going to cover that. Will the audit identify the number of change orders over the last three projects that was done? The number of change orders that might have came in to increase the scope or scope of cost? Change the scope of cost. And what was that looking like? And what was the dollar amount of those change orders? Because I think that again, when we're doing an audit to try to get an understanding of how things are going. I think understanding where the change orders are coming from and the process in which that's happening might also let us know what it is we could do differently to be more transparent. And then will the audit cover the scopes? Because I understand that one of the things that we were talking about with Jefferson was that we wanted to be a completely climate neutral or something like that. Whatever the terminology we were using, I don't understand it. I drive a big truck and I burn a lot of smoke. But I'm just saying we're trying to get there. And so we were saying we want Jefferson to be the first school that was 100%. I think it was like, is that what. Is that what caused it? And it's so clean energy. Yeah. Net zero. That's what it is. So what does it. Will it identify these things? And then the last thing that I'm. The last thing that I want to say is that. And I'm done. I put it all down so that when I get to this last point, I have to stop talking for the night. And it's my daughter's birthday and I'm gonna leave y'all, whether y'all get finished or not, to go to her. Her birthday party up at Red Robin. So it's about to be tough. But the. The last thing that I'm going to state is that I want to come back to this whole idea of just power forward, Power forward. I believe that we can get every one of our schools to help. I believe that we can get every one of our high schools. Let me say that I believe that we can get every one of our high schools done with the. With the money that we currently have in the bond. I also believe that we could possibly, even if we got very aggressive and I believe in being aggressive, that we could use some of that funding to say that we're going to come back and we're going to make sure that we address all the H VAC systems in every one of our elementary schools and middle schools with the remaining funding. The reason I feel like this is important is because there was a drum beat during the teacher strike that we stopped talking about. And the drum that everybody was beating besides the other stuff was that we want our facilities, we want our schools to be free of rats, mold. And they had a whole anthem that they were beating the drum about rats, mold, coal, rats, mold, coal. And I'm looking at how are. With what we're doing, keeping the number where it's at addressing some of the issues that address those. Those things. The rats that are in our schools. Let's stop saying that. We don't. We don't have them. They're in there. The mold that's in the school and the heat during the summer and air during. The air during the. I mean heat during. What is it? The winter air during the summer. So all those things. I've now said everything that I've got on my list. We got about 10 minutes.

B: Okay. I'm really glad, I guess that we are talking about promise to taxpayers. I'm a taxpayer too. And that we're actually trying to find opportunities to build excellent buildings for not for half a million dollars. I was really shocked to hear that we might have a high school that would be the most expensive high school in the country. I'm really curious to get this report from the Cornerstone Group to find out. I'm trying to temper my expectations but I'm really curious about why we are so excited. Expensive here in Portland to build. I'm looking for that nugget because I don't understand and I've worked in construction and other public agencies and our costs are just out of the water. I'm really happy with the package as it is. I would like. I think it would be wise to provide for that 470 million.

E: Couple things just around the honor of peace when we're talking about potential savings piece and what the audit can bring to us. I know we had talked about it at the last board meeting when we were directing the superintendent about the audit. As far as the CMGC piece, if it's a. Is it a potential cost savings if they're separated or not separated? I don't know if the audits are going to talk about that but I know that's one of the things that we. Director superintendent to look at. And then I just want to be. Just put it out here. Do we really have enough time and information to make a data driven decision by the May election? Right. I'm hearing all these pulling different, you know, perspectives and it seems like some folks are waiting on information. Some folks feel that we should just go ahead. I just don't want to go ahead just for the sake of going ahead. If it's not going to benefit our kids, period, you know, if we're going to, if it's going to benefit our kids to move forward, then damn it, let's move forward. If we need to pause to really look at the overall landscape and see we already know that high school is going to get done, I don't think that's the question anymore. I know we talked about athletics. I don't think that should be a question anymore since we all want to talk about athletics, so that shouldn't be a question anymore. But it seems like there's some questions about some other things and I just want to make sure that we're looking at the whole picture before we make sure that we're going to do right for our kids. What we don't want to do is, oh well, we wouldn't have put a should have because we was rushing or it seemed like we was in urgency. And I do believe we should be urgent, but not too urgent where it affects our kids. So I think I'll just stop there. Once again, we need to ask for more. At 2.2 billion, if you look at the slides, it doesn't change the tax rate, so no one pays any more taxes. It doesn't change the bond rate. As far as you know, when we can go off for another the bond, it adds $400 million to $560 million that we need for the next eight years. So I just, I'm going to just put that out there. Like I think the voters would absolutely approve a 2.2 billion dollar bond to make sure that we are keeping up with the deferred maintenance that we need of almost $992 million of deferred maintenance that we have right now. So I would just implore us to say that's actually 2.2. It doesn't cost nobody anymore. Still at the same 250 per thousand rate. It doesn't change anything. It just adds more money to what we can do for our kids.

C: So I'm going to start by saying I think I'm optimistic. I think we can do the work but we have a lot of work to do before the referral. But I think we can do it. And it's, I'll just say the delay. It's like we didn't have a meeting in November. We got the materials on Wednesday. And so this is a natural reaction of like, hey, there's some new ideas on the table and the community's going to want to understand it. And I think we have an obligation to build that understanding of exactly what it is that we're going to have on the bond before we ask people to do it. But I believe we just have to keep accelerating the pace and we need to do our work in public and so that people can see the thought process that's going into it. I mean, I want to just go back to the tech and the curriculum that we had lots of conversations last spring. And I think some of those discussions got us to a better place. And so I'm believing that targets that the superintendent has laid out there can get us to a better place. But I also think we have to have a plan that we're referring to voters that has enough specificity that people know what they're getting for their taxes. And that's kind of our credibility and the ability to pass it within voters. Having said that, I have sort of four just final additional thoughts. Some of the questions I ask, I would ask that the Q and A that we got today get posted because I think it will answer some community questions that people have. Again, getting more information out to people, sharing out the ed spec so people understand, understand the required versus the preferred. And then I do think, and this is both Director DePass and I mentioned this, you know, process of how we're going to prioritize the deferred maintenance. We have no shortage of it. So it seems like we could come up with a way to prioritize it and then have that sort of caveat line item of emergencies and everything else. I would like us to consider the slightly larger athletic package because I don't know how we answer the question about what we're going to do for these communities that aren't going to have the full. I'm getting a second. And then I also shared last spring and again before this meeting, an amendment to add a Center for Native Student Success. And this came about from discussions with board members before we were passing the Albina Vision Trust and when we were acknowledging that land from Albino was taken from the black community, that also originally land for the school district was taken from the native community, that the Native community response was, you know, it'd be nice to have something more than land acknowledgments as our engagement with the district. So again that's been posted. I hope that will be considered by the board. And also I know that we've had letters of support last spring and also more recently from our native staff and students and community members. And then the last item is if there is savings or I don't know what we want to call it, but that 470, whatever that number is, again, I think we should have a process of how we prioritize it. And I'm really with Director Dilley because I'm about ready. I'm not leading that we should identify like major systems that we're going to target. And I think the H VAC system, I'm very much in agreement with that because it's the heat and the cold and students are losing instructional time. We know that. And we couldn't run summer school. I mean there's a whole host of things. So I think targeting something for that. Everybody in the community would know that, hey, my school. School's gonna have be able to operate all year round and not have to close down when it's too hot in the summer or ice storm. So really thinking about how we share with the community, like we hear this is a priority and we're gonna make investments in it versus I mean I'm concerned about right now doing something like we're gonna pick two middle schools to modernize and everybody else is going to have hot or cold schools for another 10 years. So I would think. I know in the, for example, the 2012 bond we told like all the middle schools are going to get new science labs. And it really helped with our middle. I mean it was focused on our curriculum and academics and every middle school got something. It wasn't like, like, hey, you have to wait your turn in 20 years until you get modernized to get a. The right science lab. So I'm with. And that's all. But we're gonna have to accelerate the pace. But I think we can do it.

A: Okay, thanks for those comments. From a process. I'm gonna have a couple other things to say but from a process perspective, we do have time on tomorrow's board meeting but to talk about this. But I don't know if we're going to need to take it. Director Wong, Chair Wong, because the whole board was here tonight. So if you want to, we can continue the conversation. But in the board work session Two weeks from now, we are going to be talking about the bond overall. So, again, this package, you know, some of the. Some of the feedback that folks have had is going to come forward for additional conversation in two weeks. And, you know, I'm happy to loop back with leadership. In terms of the overall timing, I. I said it before, but I think. I think. I think what I'm concerned about is this one. It's been a very lengthy process. You know, we have been moving quickly, but not that quickly, and we can certainly extend it out. I think most of the questions tonight, they're really good questions from all board members. They're really good questions, but they're really good questions about general school board governance and general school district governance. And I feel like what we're doing is we're taking this, you know, because we're passing a bond. Everyone feels like, oh, my gosh, we have to understand how are we. How are we prioritizing all of our projects, how are we auditing these things? How are we doing back? Those are questions we can ask at any single time about any of the bonds that are on the table. Delaying the referral of a bond that has already been delayed and is already putting those high schools at risk in order to ask general questions that can be asked and answered at any time, I think is a huge mistake. What we need to do is put forward a credible, transparent package that the district can be held accountable for. That's the package that the superintendent and staff have put on the table. And so I think there's some real value in moving forward, and I think there's some real risk. I mean, when we talk about wanting to not do something that's going to harm our kids, I actually really think delaying this in order to get a lot of these questions that really don't have to do with the bond, they have to do with general governance. Answer could potentially harm our kids. I made you say your point about the three billing just because I wanted to respond to it, Director Hollins and I. Well, because I think it's important for a public conversation. Director Hollins and I actually agree on this 100% that we both want to see 3, 4, 5 billion dollars come in. The only thing we disagree on is where the line is between what voters will support it, what they will, and that's a subjective line. We don't know. It is very possible at $2.2 billion, we could run a winning campaign. It's very possible at $3 billion, we could run a winning campaign. I don't think so. I think $1.8 billion bond is going to be really, really touch and go in today's environment. Given the polling, given the, you know, even though this doesn't raise taxes, given the anti tax environment, I think it's going to be a very, very hard and challenging campaign, one we can win. But I don't think it's going to be my much. I point back to things like the zoo bond barely passed. It was for. I can't remember, I should know this 50 or a couple hundred million dollars, 265 million dollars. Do you know how much people love the animals?

D: And so my.

start time: 2192:26:42.000
end time: 2211:26:44.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And again same thing. It was not a tax increase. My point being that it's going to be a challenging campaign. And so, so that's. The disagreement is not about the meat. Right. The disagreement is just about the politics of it. And I think that's going to be one of the key things, you know and I may be able to send there. I think it's been a good meeting. We'll have time for more conversations. I do worry about things getting thrown in at the last minute that aren't well thought out. I think there's, there's opportunity in the future. That's the very last point I wanted to make. This bond locks the district in, but I'm using that intentionally. It locks the district for eight years from going out for another bond at the same tax rate. What it doesn't do is lock the district in from going out for another GEO bond with an increased tax rate. And that's something that we talked about right as a board last year and we decided that given the politics and the polling it would be too hard to pass. There's nothing that prevents a board a year from now, two years from now, three years from now going out for another go bond with a tax increase and generating additional dollars for additional projects. And I think it's an important thing as we talk about not everything's going to be in this bond but future boards, if the political dynamic changes can go back out again for tax increases.

start time: 2211:28:52.000
end time: 2215:05:56.000
confidence: 0.92
E: So just make sure I understand. So he's saying we shouldn't go out for more now even though it's not going to be a tax increase but potentially another board can go out for another one that will be a tax increase and that'll probably be an easier way to pass.

start time: 2215:07:08.000

start time: 2215:17:56.000
end time: 2218:45:06.000
confidence: 0.92
E: It doesn't make right. I'm just saying. So why would we do more now without having to try to have another board that we might not be on have the difficult time of going out to raise taxes.

start time: 2218:48:18.000
end time: 2224:09:08.000
confidence: 0.97
A: No, the reason is because the polling has shown and if you're paying attention to the political environment right now, Gary, it isn't very good for a lot of things. And I think that one of the fears is that if we lose this bond, if we lose this bond, it sets us back at least a couple years before we go out again. So.

start time: 2224:10:04.000
end time: 2228:05:56.000
confidence: 0.88
E: So the issue is tenants could be if we do win, which I. I'm always where we going to win and we can pass the 2.2, that's $400 million that potentially can go into deferred maintenance for the same folks who kids is going to benefit.

And there's no one doing this.
