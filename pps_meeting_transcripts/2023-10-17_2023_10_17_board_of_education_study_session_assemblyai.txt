A non profit organization intended to support the district's goals through fundraising for our district. Tonight we have a couple folks that are going to be providing the board an update. First, Victoria. Victoria Lara, who you probably recognize, she serves as our chair of the fund for the PPS board. She's also the founder and CEO of Lada Media Services. This is her day job.

B: So, as Victoria alluded to, there are a number of priorities that the Fund for PPS is focused on, but in the aggregate or the main focus is to nurture the whole child, right? We are in service of public schools. The Fund for PPS is to ensure that our students experience health, joy, self expression, curiosity and learning. And we're doing that in a number of ways. I will highlight four major initiatives. The Fund for PPS is focused on raising money. Score. The first one is Healing center schools. We know that our students continue to need mental health and behavioral health supports. And so we are working with the Office of Student Support Services to really lean into how do we create schools that are not necessarily focused on trauma informed practices, but healing centered practices, which is a shift not only for the district, but one that philanthropy in our conversations have been very interested, keenly interested in that shift. Right. Because again, especially coming out of the pandemic, we need to focus on how to heal and not how we continue to focus on the trauma, as Victoria alluded to or named. We were founded at the end of 2019, and in early 2020, the pandemic hit. So our shift became about raising money for what we consider the crisis relief. That effort of crisis relief continues now, and we continue to support parents and families who need services, services like, you know, I don't have enough money for rent. I don't have enough money for gas or electricity. Our team works closely with our social workers across our, you know, our schools, who are the ones that are on the ground, if you will, working directly with families. We are also focused on arts education and enrichment And I think that's a really important opportunity for not only us, but funders to get excited about participating in partnership with pps. I will note this last year the Heart of Portland was funded, funded by the Fund for pps, supported by many of the sponsors that we brought to the table. And the last one that we are focused on is the inspired sustainable school yards. This is in alignment with our response to the climate crisis here at pps. And so we're focused on how do we make sure that our children have green sustainable yards that they can play with. You all know that there's a lot of pavement out there and we need to begin to shift that. And obviously the board policy calls for that. And our fundraising efforts include that there are other areas, whether supporting the center for Black Student Excellence, affinity groups, career exploration, and generally just innovation in the school district. What I'm excited about the fund, you know, what the fund brings is private dollars to be able to innovate. Right. These are dollars that you can use to support things that, you know, districts don't necessarily always have the money or the supports to do. So what has been our impact? And we have our annual report. Where is. Did we get handout?

start time: 150:59:00.000
end time: 151:33:00.000
confidence: 0.91
D: We put it in the board book.

start time: 151:35:00.000
end time: 151:57:00.000
confidence: 0.91
C: It's on my desk. I'm sorry.

start time: 151:58:20.000
end time: 157:40:36.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Oh, sorry. So we have hard copies for you and you also got the annual report. But in terms of our impact, you know, just. There are many ways to talk about the impact, but I, I really want to lift up a couple big voices. One is from our, one of our social workers. You know, what was powerful, what's powerful.

start time: 157:41:08.000
end time: 158:14:12.000
confidence: 0.97
F: About working with our social workers is.

start time: 158:15:56.000
end time: 161:40:20.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Many times what we heard. Look, I meet with parents all the time or students, but I don't know what resources to provide. So they tell me, you know, hey, but you know, what can I do.

start time: 161:41:00.000
end time: 161:53:56.000
confidence: 0.92
F: As a social worker?

start time: 161:54:28.000
end time: 185:33:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I don't have those resources. Fortunately, again, in partnership with us, we are able to make supportive families in that our visual and performing arts. Again, another example of our impact, we supported in the development of the Master Arts Education plan, being able to bring in funders to help define design that with our teachers. And then our climate justice effort, you know, we continue to provide students many opportunities to get involved in the response to the climate crisis. Prices and again, these funds that are secured through philanthropic gifts support these efforts. Now, there are two aspects to the Fund for pps. There is the local school foundations and the PPS Parent Awards. As you know, you're all having active conversations about the future of local school Foundations and PPS parent awards. However, I wanted to make sure to provide you a snapshot of the dollars that have been raised and the amounts that are being re granted via the PPS parent awards. And I think it's important to know that every dollar that is raised on local school foundations and given to parent in the parent fund awards, none of that helps operational expenses for PPS. These dollars, 100% go to schools.

start time: 185:58:40.000
end time: 190:21:10.000
confidence: 0.91
C: So Jonathan, back on that. So if the equity or the parent fund awards, there's 62 schools. The other funds that buy PPS positions, how many schools is that impacting?

start time: 190:54:50.000
end time: 191:25:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: How many schools are 30?

start time: 191:33:30.000
end time: 192:37:06.000
confidence: 0.91
C: Oh, there's, there's 22 active foundations this.

start time: 192:38:18.000
end time: 192:48:30.000
confidence: 1.00
G: Year.

start time: 193:24:10.000
end time: 197:56:20.000
confidence: 0.97
C: And it might have been a few more that year. And so those. I'm just trying to understand it. So the independent foundations are the ones that they send just their 30% to.

start time: 198:18:40.000
end time: 199:27:52.000
confidence: 0.95
B: They send their full check plus 30%. Yeah.

start time: 199:30:16.000
end time: 199:54:00.000
confidence: 0.98
C: And that's the 960.

start time: 199:56:00.000
end time: 200:03:52.000
confidence: 0.79
A: Correct.

start time: 200:04:56.000
end time: 200:49:44.000
confidence: 0.98
C: And how many schools is that? That's eight.

start time: 200:51:12.000
end time: 200:58:32.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Eight.

start time: 201:00:16.000
end time: 202:07:20.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Okay, can you go, can you say that again? So, so this is the.

start time: 202:09:20.000
end time: 204:26:00.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So independent foundations are eight foundations that are non profit. They have their own independent non profit status.

start time: 204:27:20.000
end time: 204:32:56.000
confidence: 0.70
D: Okay.

start time: 204:33:28.000
end time: 207:11:40.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So they operate independently. Those 8 raise, you know, in fiscal year 23, $960,000.

start time: 207:34:40.000
end time: 207:49:12.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Okay.

start time: 207:51:36.000
end time: 210:15:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: And then. But of those funds raised, they, they can keep 10,000 and they keep 33%. Oh, they keep.

start time: 210:16:00.000
end time: 210:37:44.000
confidence: 0.82
B: No, I'm sorry, 66%.

start time: 210:39:12.000
end time: 211:50:00.000
confidence: 0.90
D: So 66. Okay. So they just. It's 30%, 33% off the top.

start time: 212:03:00.000
end time: 212:30:04.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Except for the first 10,000.

start time: 212:32:52.000
end time: 213:09:32.000
confidence: 0.88
D: Minus the 10,000. Thank you.

start time: 213:12:36.000
end time: 220:27:50.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Okay. And then how many affiliated foundations are there? There's 22 this year. There may have been 25 represented or something in 2023. So there were 30. 30 schools that got 2.5. This have 2.5 million and 62 schools that go collectively, they got 1.1.

start time: 220:32:50.000
end time: 220:41:14.000
confidence: 0.80
F: Right.

start time: 220:42:42.000
end time: 223:11:54.000
confidence: 0.94
C: So yes. And some schools that have foundations, not very many, but there is like a diagram where there are some schools that get.

start time: 223:14:42.000
end time: 224:17:46.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Okay, some schools that do raise money and also get parent funds.

start time: 224:18:18.000
end time: 224:48:10.000
confidence: 0.94
C: So yeah, maybe a handful.

start time: 224:49:30.000
end time: 244:39:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah. And so the next slide here is the district, the districts, the fund's financials. I want to note that in your package you also got two documents here. One is called Candid 2023 Seals of Transparency Guide. And this one just has the name of the fund for pps. So guidestar is a reputable organization that helps non profits be transparent about their financials and other major issues. So 990s, etc. So this document is available online and it's provided to you. I'm proud to say that the fund for PPS is at the top, meaning platinum. And so you can read through what that means there. The fund, you know, accepts gifts of any size from individual donors, corporate gifts and business sponsorships, philanthropy and in kind gifts. And here you can see those sources of revenue for the last two years.

start time: 246:12:40.000
end time: 253:32:58.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Sure. So this three, this 377,000, that's what was raised outside of the foundation funding. Correct. And what was the expenses for that? We brought in 377. What were the expenses that we. That was paid out?

start time: 253:35:14.000
end time: 256:52:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Yeah, great question. If you look at our annual report on page 10, you can see those expenses there.

start time: 257:02:30.000
end time: 257:45:02.000
confidence: 0.86
A: So total expenses of 371.

start time: 257:46:46.000
end time: 258:00:46.000
confidence: 0.27
B: Yep.

start time: 258:03:58.000
end time: 259:56:14.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Yeah, 3,371 thousand. Now, is that what was this says program?

start time: 259:57:42.000
end time: 260:02:06.000
confidence: 0.77
F: Yeah.

start time: 260:02:38.000
end time: 260:16:30.000
confidence: 0.98
A: I don't know what that means.

start time: 260:17:10.000
end time: 280:11:20.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yep. I'll define these three. Robin, correct me if I'm wrong at any point, program is dollars that were sent directly to PPS to support student program. So those are things that support, like the heart of Portland that supports students or families that are needing, you know, that crisis response. So anything that is, you know, a gift to the district or a gift to family management. As you all know, we have a fund for pps, has an agreement with PPS where PPS reimburses some of my time, some of Robin's time. So that is what is reflected there. So those $57,000 are actually going back to the district as well. So the $12,000 that are left are fundraising. This is paid for our fundraiser and accounting software. So this, it's a very small operation that the fund for PPS offer uses. So I'm proud to say I think 99% every dollar goes back to PPS or students in some way.

start time: 281:53:40.000
end time: 290:00:38.000
confidence: 0.92
C: I'm just trying to get the total amount. So there's not. I don't see page numbers on these, but if you go back to the slide that has the. The two charts. Yeah, that one. So is it the 2.5 and the 1.1, that's all money coming into the fund? No, I'm sorry, It's just the 2.5 and the 1.

start time: 290:01:34.000
end time: 293:41:00.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Well, so in fiscal year 23. Let's look at fiscal year 23. So the 2.5 million plus the 1.1 from the parent fund, all that comes into the fund for PPS.

start time: 294:56:00.000
end time: 314:21:18.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Balance sheet. So this has it in. So the parent. Is it upper numbers? That is that. That's money that is coming into the fund. And then the 1.1 is going out. Or is it 3.6 million coming in? I'm trying to figure out what total budget is, because on the next page you have the 377,000. What is the total amount that comes in? So all of these monies come into the fund, and then mostly it all comes into pps And. And then it's in their finance accounts. Some of them they're paid directly to, like, alternative schools. Like the PPS Parent Fund Awards might be paid directly, but. So basically all of this is in and then out. Okay, when you say all of this, are you talking about the beginning, the top piece? All of these dollars come in through the fund and come back into the Parent Fund awards? Those aren't coming in from the 62 schools. They're going up. The 62 schools.

start time: 314:22:54.000
end time: 315:15:42.000
confidence: 0.96
B: No, they. But they come in. They get raised from this group.

start time: 315:17:26.000
end time: 315:58:06.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Well, that's what I'm asking. Is the 2.5. The.

start time: 315:59:18.000
end time: 317:08:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: The total 2.5? No, this is two thirds.

start time: 317:18:30.000
end time: 317:56:10.000
confidence: 0.99
C: No, but is that the total that comes.

start time: 318:03:50.000
end time: 321:04:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: The total that comes in is 3.6. And a third of that gets sent out to the Parent Fund Awards, and two thirds gets.

start time: 321:06:30.000
end time: 327:24:56.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Okay, so this is. So 3.6 is the total. Well, actually, it's about 4 million. Including the second page, it's about 4 million. And then 2.5 of that goes to the schools that have foundations, which are about 30. And then 1.1 million of it goes.

start time: 327:25:28.000
end time: 328:35:50.000
confidence: 0.89
F: To 62 other schools will have the right. Yeah. Yeah.

B: That's a great question, Chair Hollins. I'd say, you know, I will acknowledge that. So prior to coming to the district in, my job was fundraising at a.

B: And so I know the power of philanthropy and the impact that it can have. We, unfortunately, in 2019, when we launched, it had, I'd say, big aspirations. And the pandemic really took an impact. So we shifted again, focused on the crisis response. And since then, I think it's been a year and a half, two years. We've been trying to find different ways to engage philanthropy differently. Spring we hosted our first fundraiser event, which I thought was really successful for our first one. Thank you to all the philanthropists that supported. I think we want to continue that. And as you alluded to last year, I think we can do a big one. I think that's. That's definitely the goal. Number two is we acknowledge that our board of the Fund for PPS, again, appreciate Victoria's leadership. King can grow. And so we're actively engaging with a numerous number of potential board members that include C Suite executives from some of the major companies and organizations in the city of Portland. We know that that's an avenue to engage philanthropically. Ultimately, I think the question for our community is how and how and how much should they invest in PPs and in the fund? Right. And I think part of the challenge.

start time: 375:57:12.000
end time: 376:12:56.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Right now is that.

start time: 376:14:08.000
end time: 386:55:22.000
confidence: 0.93
B: That political discourse that's happening, the future of fundraising. So once that stabilizes, I believe that we will have a. Once we have a clear future about the fundraising at pps, I think then we could help donors, you know, really find their niche in fundraising and giving to PPs and that. Because, you know what? I. What I don't want to do is tell anyone. I mean, obviously, as a fundraiser, your. Your job is to move people in a certain direction. But I also recognize that being part of a school system, you are.

end time: 390:19:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Right. Athletics, arts, you know, the list can go on and on. So how do we help find that niche for those donors?

end time: 396:17:54.000
confidence: 0.92
D: I have a question kind of on those lines. If. Where. So the long. What's the long game? What would be an ultimate success story, let's say, in three years? And where do you see the biggest gaps in service? Or what are we solving for, I.

start time: 396:18:02.000
end time: 396:40:50.000

start time: 397:07:38.000
end time: 397:47:46.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Kind of obvious, but not to me.

start time: 397:48:58.000
end time: 405:55:24.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah. I'll start with your first. Your last question first. I think the focus of the fund, just like a lot of fundraising organizations that support districts, they're really in this. In. They sit well in that space of innovation, right. That. That. That place where the district's leadership, district staff have ideas that they want to try. What we know is that, you know, when you try things with public dollars, there's a lot of scrutiny.

start time: 405:56:12.000
end time: 406:12:40.000
confidence: 0.62
D: Yes, Right.

start time: 406:19:00.000
end time: 409:36:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And so I think the beauty of private investments is that, you know, that we can play around, we can get a little dirty. You know, with some of that, I'll use.

start time: 410:09:30.000
end time: 410:24:02.000
confidence: 0.84
F: Or fail forward.

start time: 410:25:46.000
end time: 419:13:48.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I'll use one of our examples, which is the PGE investment that we have. Right. PGE came to us or not to us. We came to an agreement where they invested in our efforts around climate justice. Now this was before the climate crisis response policy that you passed. And so they went on, they took a big leap to say we want to support this because they were really excited about the idea of developing curriculum that was focused on the climate response. And so, you know, that allowed a little bit of flexibility.

start time: 419:15:24.000
end time: 419:20:28.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Right.

start time: 419:21:24.000
end time: 434:36:56.000
confidence: 0.95
B: We were bringing teachers to help create that curriculum. They partnered with executives and other folks from pge. And you know, I just remember the story of like VGE has a, a bird watcher of some sort position. And they came out and they, you know, talk about their role and the importance of being in there and that will impact the climate justice. So I think those are the types of opportunities that the fund really creates. Your first question was about long term. Again, I think, you know, I think the reality is that the last few years have been rough for the fun in the sense that it hasn't been able to really define its voice. Right. You are still, the fund for PPS is still in some ways competing.

start time: 434:40:08.000
end time: 434:58:32.000
confidence: 0.93
F: And I don't say that in a.

start time: 434:58:56.000
end time: 436:56:08.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Negative way, competing with organizations like All Hands Raised. Right. And so especially with philanthropy.

start time: 436:57:44.000
end time: 437:05:12.000
confidence: 0.88
F: Right.

start time: 437:06:56.000
end time: 445:23:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Why am I, why should I invest in the fund versus if I'm already investing in All Hands Raised? And so for us, it's a matter of telling the right story. And so I think over the last few months our team has been really working on trying to write that story and tell us and have that story speak to who we want, what we want to create, which is our dollars are going to support the children of boarding public schools.

start time: 445:51:30.000
end time: 454:58:00.000
confidence: 0.91
D: I think the PGE example is excellent because I know they're also, in addition to developing the K12 curriculum for clarity justice, they also have some other giving us going towards CTE and developing like careers that start at high school level, two year associate's degree, four year degree, et cetera. So I'm not sure if any of those funds are being deployed to help high school students engage in STEM fields, I believe, But I know that they have. The PGE is investing in the future.

start time: 456:33:24.000
end time: 458:15:20.000

F: The same answer again. But maybe putting in a little bit broader context. And we had some of these conversations last year and I was the liaison.

start time: 463:27:08.000
end time: 464:21:32.000
confidence: 0.93

confidence: 0.87
F: You know, staff person could pull out. What are five of the 10 most successful sort of philanthropic efforts going on in our German districts and what are the risks? Because I think that helps us understand.

start time: 473:07:18.000

start time: 474:18:22.000
end time: 474:48:22.000

F: I know Portland is notoriously difficult around.

start time: 476:33:34.000
end time: 478:43:28.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Philanthropy because even though we got a couple big corporations, it's just, it's not like San Francisco, it's not like New York, it's not even like Seattle, North Carolina.

start time: 478:45:04.000
end time: 478:55:40.000

B: Right.

start time: 479:14:00.000
end time: 479:33:52.000

start time: 479:34:16.000
end time: 486:51:48.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Out there as that's my frame as I sort of look at these entire policies. Yeah, I think there's a lot of great examples where districts have an education foundation working in partnership with them. They serve purposes, the rallying community stakeholders, business community, philanthropy. And really they're supporting sort of the edge of district transformation in most cases.

start time: 486:52:44.000
end time: 486:56:20.000
confidence: 0.51
F: Right.

start time: 486:57:00.000
end time: 509:24:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: In our past district, yes, we had the benefit of folks in the technology industry who understood what we were trying to do with the school district. So they did things like fund our middle school redesign, redo our playgrounds, cafeterias, internships at tech companies, launch new CTE programs and video game design. Like, there was a lot of excitement for coming in to innovate with the school district that created opened up an avenue that then we could figure out, give us some time to sustain, scale out. So, you know, it was a really powerful mechanism. You know, I could give you examples. My prior district before that, the Boston Excellence, had a very heavy, academic, policy oriented sort of focus and, you know, worked hand in hand with the district over a decade in pushing that district's literacy practices, for instance, making the best examples around. So, you know, there are a lot of examples, you know, there's a lot of potential in the fund. Sort of we can galvanize around. What are the areas, you know, that we can prioritize and support the funds growth by tapping into many networks in the community or that you may know.

start time: 509:29:20.000
end time: 513:31:52.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So one of the folks that we are, I can't name them yet because we're still working through some stuff, but someone that's agreed to join the board is an executive from the Portland Chamber.

start time: 513:32:56.000
end time: 513:37:28.000
confidence: 0.71
A: Right.

start time: 513:38:24.000
end time: 522:09:30.000
confidence: 0.96
B: And so with a real deep access to that business network and part of that conversation with them is how does the Portland Business alliance and PPS or the Fund for PPS Partner work more coherently to think about those strategic investments? Because the reality is we have a lot of folks that do give to PPs in a variety of ways. It is the power of unifying those dollars to make the biggest impact that we're trying to get to.

start time: 522:20:20.000
end time: 522:33:20.000

start time: 525:14:36.000
end time: 525:30:52.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Yeah, I have several.

start time: 525:32:36.000
end time: 525:56:12.000
confidence: 0.83
B: Okay, I'll follow up.

start time: 525:57:56.000
end time: 591:14:26.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Question 2 questions. So if looking at the 4 million, the 2 thirds of the benefit go to the schools with the higher incomes and then one looks like about one third go to the lower income schools. And I'm curious if you've done like any future planning about what, what would it take to instead of giving 5 to 15,000 to the schools that are getting the equity grants that are our lowest income schools generally and serving mostly more students of color, what, like, what would that take for the fund to do that? What amount? I think we focused more on initiatives like that, like galvanize the donor. Because I think sometimes when you talk about the amounts for schools, like the business community feels like that should come from their taxes, state funding. So it's been more about what will enhance the experience of students and ensure that we're prioritizing with the racial equity and social justice lens. What those initiatives are, how that's going to impact. I guess I'm looking at it from just from the sort of policymaker or the student or school experience of the schools that are getting less money is like, I'm just like, interesting, like what would that look like to try and close that gap so that all schools are getting from the fund, which hopefully that would be. Maybe there's a way to express that to donors in a way that is compelling. But I would be interested like what sort of planning is happening around that? Or is that being left to the school district? So that'd be one question I have. So what's the size of that gap? And then the second is just going back to sort of the founding of the fund. I was on the board when it got transferred from all hands Raised which before that was the Portland Schools Foundation. And the two most critical things the Portland Schools foundation did for PBS and our students was one, they were the gathering place for thousands of parents. So they put tens of thousands of parents in the streets the wake of measure five. So they were really the place where people went. If you wanted to support pps, that's where you went. And the second thing was they were always played a leadership role anytime we had some external money. Asked whether it was the Coalition for School funding now to get to up the state school fund or the local income tax surcharge of multimillion county or the first local options which translated into actually hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. And since it's got transfer that hasn't happened. I guess the question is, do you envision that being something that the fund a role for the fund, or should there be a separate entity that's created that does that? Because it's like a missing piece in the larger community. And I had lots of conversations with Dan Ryan and he transitioned the fund to all hands raised and they hoped a lot less. But it's like, hey, there's gonna be a vacuum because this is a huge role that the school's foundation played. So I'm curious about your thinking about in the strategic thinking of planning, if that's a role for the fund or should some other entity be set up that does that more sort of like grassroots advocacy, you know, support for all the money measures? Because it's missing right now.

start time: 591:15:38.000
end time: 602:27:42.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Sure. So absolutely. I do agree that the fund's role has been largely silent on advocacy and investments in, you know, things like the option levy or the bond. We did, you know, in its early, I think in 2019, gave a $5,000 investment when we were starting off. And I do think that the fund for PPS should have a. Will have. Will have a third leg of its.

start time: 602:28:06.000
end time: 603:03:58.000
confidence: 0.88
F: Tool, which is this advocacy component.

start time: 603:05:34.000
end time: 618:02:36.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I wouldn't call it advocacy in the way that maybe you're describing it as much as a vessel for investments. So, you know, being able to support the local option levies or support the bond because we know that it takes money to get more money. And so I do believe that the fund for BPS will play a role there. And in fact, I think the reason it plays a role is, you know, we are all asking the same people for this for money. Right. So when we go out for a bond, we're asking PGE for money for that while we asking them for investment in programming. And so how do we unify those asks. Right. In a way that builds a better experience for the donor. And so I look forward to, you know, partnering with the board to really understand how we might do that.

start time: 618:03:48.000
end time: 632:18:18.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Yeah, just like you said, you're competing with all hands raised. It used to be people could give money to the. I mean, people gave a lot of money to the Portland Schools foundation because the board was pretty big and diverse, so covered a lot of territory. But people knew if they gave there, it's sort of like it was a twofer they were helping the foundation. But then also the foundation was like usually the largest donor in any of the campaigns, which then allowed people to like they gave once it wasn't. Because what I'm finding now is people like, oh, I already gave money to all hands raised or somebody else when you're raising money for or our local options or bonds. So having a more coordinated approach because at the end of the day, you know, being able to leverage the power of that, I say it's been a missing piece.

start time: 632:19:54.000
end time: 632:33:30.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Absolutely.

start time: 632:36:10.000
end time: 649:51:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: There's certainly the potential for the fund to play convener, catalyst, organizer on those priorities that identifies and primarily, hopefully the fund is functioning to advance the strategic plan to the next level. So to answer also your first question, because I don't see the fund as necessarily the mechanism by which to sustain school funding. For example, you know, we are grateful for the giveaway that people make in our communities and we have said from the very get go we're going to have an equity centered resource allocation model. So, you know, we're appreciative that schools can raise quite a bit of money actually. But we're also almost double funding and allocating additional staff to our most underserved communities. So, you know, we try to make sure they have. The question is, what role can the fund play in supporting all of our school communities?

start time: 650:06:10.000
end time: 650:45:30.000
confidence: 0.91
F: Provide an improved school experience for every.

start time: 652:55:30.000
end time: 655:33:50.000
confidence: 0.91
E: Sort of speaking to sort of our role as the school system to make sure that every school has adequate funding to provide core educational programming.

start time: 656:59:40.000

confidence: 0.92
A: So I'm just, and I don't know the, you guys know, the business model that you guys have or using. I just, I just wonder if when I see this, and I'm assuming this is everyone who's working there as well. Right. Are you looking at am I expanding or hiring like someone to actually go out and do fundraising? Someone that's in the community who has enough connections to go out and Find things and I'll push back a little bit with Director Scott said is, you know, I don't necessarily think this is contingent on the foundation policy stuff. I believe if the fund was doing the stuff or raising the funds that I feel it could raise easily, there would be no foundation conversation. I think that the fund could be able to do what we need to do on a regular basis. So I just wondered about the business model that you guys are using, the strategy you guys are using. Really look into that.

start time: 675:25:36.000
end time: 675:37:00.000
confidence: 0.38
F: Yeah.

start time: 675:49:20.000
end time: 681:50:38.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Because there is, there's a lot of money out there. You know, from arts to education, there's a lot of money out there. So I think it's just a matter of strategizing to how we get there and maybe it's hiring some folks to go out there and do that or something like that. Yeah, I think it has great potential.

start time: 681:52:14.000
end time: 691:09:48.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Absolutely. And I think, you know, I think it's important to. I think I agree 100% with your comments. The Fund for BPS, you know, sits in the Office of Strategic Partnerships which, which raises more money than what you see here. So I think that's a kind of an important note. We get money from state or from. Sorry, we get money from competitive government grants or.

start time: 691:10:44.000
end time: 691:26:20.000
confidence: 0.85
A: Are you talking about pps?

start time: 691:27:40.000
end time: 709:47:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Pps. So here's, here's, here's, here's what there. The Fund for PPS I think plays a very unique role in engaging business and philanthropy community who doesn't want to invest in government institutions. So we have a number of folks that said, no, I'm fine with donating to the, to Portland Public Schools. And then we, we facilitate that process. You know, a lot of, a lot of folks, philanthropy feel much to put it on or much. They're at ease with it. On the fun side, because it's a nonprofit, it has, you know, we have certain requirements in terms of what we have to submit or make available. We are, we have contemplated as the, as the board, you know, what does the future look like in terms of hiring staff. So right now the fund does not have any official staff on its payroll, if you will. It's all managed here. Right. By this team and we, and we reimburse the district.

start time: 709:56:14.000
end time: 719:06:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So that's what you see there. Yeah. So on the partnership side, I, we are hiring, we remanaged our position to make it more of a public facing or community facing fundraising position that their job is to, you know, walk that, you know, walk the line and ask for those money. So we are bringing that position to see, you know, what type of impact it can have.

C: This is just like more housekeeping. But I was looking at the list of your board members and then what was on like. And they're different. Who are, who are the current board members?

confidence: 0.98
C: And then I was looking at your bylaws is. And it looked like you had from the fund just from what was applied that there was an audit done. Is that like an annual audit done? Is that and the result is an audit or is it the filling out of the Form 990?

start time: 730:04:40.000
end time: 730:52:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: No, we do an audit every other year.

start time: 731:04:10.000
end time: 734:41:10.000
confidence: 0.98
C: We do a full audit every three years. So we're doing our second audit is in process right now. And in the off years we do a financial review with McDonnell Jacobs, a third party accounting firm.

A: Next on the agenda is the equity action plan implementation. We're here. Update on the implementation of equity action plan. Superintendent, would you please introduce this next item?

start time: 742:59:10.000
end time: 748:49:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yes. You might recall in 2122 there was an equity audit. Audits in different areas have specifically Chief of Schools Dr. Don Franco Report out on an aspect of the audit that has been ongoing work and let you know how that's going.

start time: 749:10:20.000
end time: 782:04:46.000
confidence: 0.91
F: Yeah, sounds great. I don't know if there's. Okay. So I'm happy to directors talk to you about, you know, some of the steps that we have been substantial taken in reference to the equity audit. And just like with what superintendent mentioned. So this, this equity audit took place in 2122 via survey, but then more so via focus group with administrators of color, specifically building leaders. So some of the themes that emerge were through conversations within those focus groups. I will say that when we're talking about administrators of color, it's also beyond the building leader and we're making sure talking about supports. It also includes program administrators. It also includes myself. Right. It also includes slt. It also includes those types of things. So there are going to be specific things that you'll see in terms of actions absolutely centered around building leaders of color. But then you'll also see some pieces like affinity spaces that we hold for which I think is extremely important. So and I will say this before we get to the slides is that the supports that you're going to see is really a collective approach not only with Office of School Performance, Office of Teaching and Learning, Office of Student Support Services, and absolutely working collaboratively with building leaders moving forward to address some of the that emerge through audit. You have it? You want me to go?

start time: 782:05:58.000
end time: 786:01:30.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Yeah, Well, I Asked a couple of questions. So there was a number of themes that they had in the report. Are we focused? Have we addressed all the themes, or is it just some of the themes that.

start time: 786:26:30.000
end time: 787:03:58.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I would say that we focused on all the things.

start time: 787:06:14.000
end time: 787:29:50.000
confidence: 0.79
A: Great. Okay.

start time: 787:31:10.000
end time: 810:14:44.000
confidence: 0.94
F: And when you'll see the actual steps, you'll see that pieces of the steps. I mean, it really comes down to, like, if I were to. If I were to sum it up into one theme, that our administrators of color often feel a lack of support. Not only with feeling like they're not heard, but they also mentioned one of the themes, kind of feeling, maybe dehumanize is a strong word, but not feeling human. Like, there was a big piece there, and then also from a resource perspective and then just a feedback perspective. So where are their voices in decisions that are made? And so if we think about that theme overarchingly, we really collectively earmarked various strategies. I would say not only strategies, but feedback loops. So you'll hear some of those pieces. So I did send a memo, which kind of outlines. Oh, perfect. Can you go to the next slide? So if you take a look here. And I did mention this before. So administrators of color shared that they are often without the support and resources they need. Successful. So if you were to take the big overarching theme from the few themes, that's really what it came down to. So that includes.

start time: 810:15:32.000
end time: 816:27:26.000
confidence: 0.93
A: And if you seem like you're really minimizing when you say it's overarching, when they had like nine different things that really was descriptive of some of the way they were feeling. So when you. To me, it seemed like when you just kind of do an overarching thing, that you miss a lot of some of the other important things that they had in it. I'm looking at the original report that they had. Yes.

start time: 816:29:18.000
end time: 830:16:48.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So if you actually. So here. And what I meant by this, because I was just trying to organize it into the slide deck. Slides. Right. And so I take out those pictures, the bullets. So the bullets here are. Encompass those themes. Right. And so if you think about, like, if you were to. I'm not minimizing, but if you were to organize those into a general piece just to get on the slide deck, that's what it would be. So a lack of formal resources that are relevant to leaders of color as well as the leaders of color to support each other. I mean, that was a big piece. The invisibility and isolation of people of color. That was a piece that they felt the usefulness of having a mentor of color. Variable or limited empowerment and differing acceptance and accountability. Environment unsupportive of people of color, self and humanity.

start time: 830:18:24.000
end time: 830:41:00.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Talked about that a little.

start time: 830:50:00.000
end time: 859:07:52.000
confidence: 0.94
F: The universal and personal nature of the support provided to leaders within the district. And if you go to the memo, you can see a little bit more description descriptors of what those actually mean. Also go to the next slide, Roseanne. So if you look. So also a big common piece, right. Because we're very cognizant of like who's staying and who's going. What's the rationale for that next slide? So in the focus groups, a theme that emerged that those who stay by staying in the district, there are opportunities to be a part of a solution. So the question was, what would keep you here? Whether through exit interviews or through these focus groups. These are things that came about through that focus group that by staying in the district, there are opportunities to be a part of the solution. So being involved, more involved in decisions, also sharing their commitment to improving the district and the educational system. So that came out loud and clear is the feel, the overarching feeling about that there's a shared commitment across the board and that they feel included in decisions. The second point here is leaving the district. What are some reasons our administrators of color are leaving? The feeling about not feeling value. Some leaders think of leaving the district because they do not feel appreciated or they do not feel that they can bring their full authentic self to work. And so that, that, that emerged through the focus group.

start time: 859:09:36.000
end time: 861:03:52.000
confidence: 0.85
A: So can you, can you. Can you go a little deeper? And we mean. What do they mean by what you mean by when they say authentic self?

start time: 861:04:56.000
end time: 866:15:30.000
confidence: 0.96
F: You know, like, you know, there's a lot of research, like around code switching. You know, like you can't come in as a person of color in a white system and be your authentic self. Right. Like I think that is. That's a struggle for all people of color.

start time: 867:02:30.000
end time: 867:31:42.000
confidence: 0.80
D: It's. I can, I can explain it.

start time: 867:32:06.000
end time: 867:34:38.000
confidence: 0.96
F: It's.

start time: 867:34:54.000
end time: 868:15:10.000
confidence: 0.85
A: It. You can't show. I know what code switching is.

start time: 868:15:50.000
end time: 873:07:16.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Well, no, not code switching. That's. It was you. You asked to clarify, like to go deeper about like what this non appreciation looks like for not being able to be fully authentic and it's being able to bring your full culture to work. Is that. That's my understanding. Whether that's a hairstyle, big earrings.

start time: 873:09:08.000
end time: 873:50:00.000
confidence: 0.53
F: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

start time: 874:13:00.000
end time: 874:52:04.000
confidence: 0.92
D: And with that, whatever you bring with your culture.

start time: 874:54:12.000
end time: 886:16:00.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Yeah. And with that comes rights, the implicit bias piece that comes in based on, you know, looks or how you talk those types of things. Right. And so that's what they meant in terms of authentic self. And that's what I meant by code switching. Right. Like you are one way, say around. Like, we just had an affinity space for all administrators last week. And to see how they would. How they. How we were right. In that affinity space. And one person said it was. Is different. Right. Than when they're working in the schools to a certain extent, how to help.

start time: 886:27:40.000
end time: 887:30:44.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Was that the first affinity space that they did it, or was this. Has this been going on since?

start time: 887:32:12.000
end time: 890:10:00.000
confidence: 0.98
F: This has been going on. So we made an adjustment. So we've always. So what we've done. Last year, we did affinity spaces during leadership, which we had monthly.

start time: 890:19:40.000
end time: 890:28:52.000
confidence: 0.72
A: Right.

start time: 890:30:36.000
end time: 909:56:10.000
confidence: 0.94
F: And so that was for those who don't know, leadership is when we gather all building administrators or principals in general together in central office leadership. So we've made the adjustment to not only have that, but then to offer affinity space outside. So the affinity space that we offered outside of leadership, the first one, occurred last week. And so those will happen at least quarterly in terms of learning, reflection and just being in community. And then we'll also mix in some other spaces where we can just be social and just be in community together. I think that's an important piece. I sent you a little bit of feedback, and people just appreciate kind of being in that space, you know, together. It was. It was facilitated by village resiliency. And so there's a level of just. Kind of just coming back to who you are, the level of empowerment. I think what we heard loud and clear is that, you know, even after just that short time of two hours was just a just a feeling of just. You just feel good, right. You're invigorating. Right. You remember why you're in this work and also that, you know that you're in this collective.

start time: 910:19:20.000
end time: 912:08:16.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And so. So you mentioned that you did these affinity groups during leadership. Correct. Is that something that was always done before, too?

start time: 912:10:48.000
end time: 912:21:36.000
confidence: 0.99
F: No.

start time: 912:24:08.000
end time: 912:52:32.000
confidence: 0.99
A: So it just happened after this report?

start time: 912:54:16.000
end time: 914:54:24.000
confidence: 0.99
F: After. Yes. Well, there were talks about it happening before, but we really instituted after some feedback from.

start time: 914:57:12.000
end time: 915:09:00.000
confidence: 1.00
A: From.

start time: 915:23:20.000
end time: 922:14:50.000
confidence: 0.95
F: And it's like I said, it's been expanded. They used to do. We used to do again, it's my understanding that several years ago, the affinity spaces outside of leadership did happen. Centraling on Singleton's courageous conversations, kind of using that kind of overarching as a model. And so that didn't happen. That happened a long time ago. So we're in a sense, kind of bringing that piece back.

start time: 922:30:30.000
end time: 923:46:06.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Dr. Franco, when we had the original presentation was that two years ago.

start time: 923:48:38.000
end time: 924:25:32.000
confidence: 0.82
E: It was last year actually last October.

start time: 924:28:06.000
end time: 930:34:40.000
confidence: 0.93
C: So it was presented more from, not from the top, but more the building and the people who built the report. So I'm curious like this presentation, did PASA review it or did it have input? I'm just curious because last time we had actually the ones who wrote the report and the recommendations present.

start time: 930:36:40.000
end time: 940:17:50.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah. So actually I sent these steps out in the spring of last year because what we did is we also have building leader focus groups. And so I sent an update of not only things that we did do, but things this was on the agenda or this was, these were steps that we were going to take this year, making sure to address the themes that came up not only through equity audit, but really things that came up through successful school survey as well. So they have seen these steps and if they haven't read these, they're feeling it right now.

start time: 940:44:10.000
end time: 942:05:50.000
confidence: 0.89
C: That's great that somebody said that. But I'm just curious like in response to the equity audit because there was.

start time: 942:14:50.000
end time: 942:57:22.000
confidence: 0.84
F: So Carmen, Carmen on PAPSA has seen.

start time: 942:57:46.000
end time: 943:07:10.000
confidence: 0.98
B: These.

start time: 944:09:30.000
end time: 944:44:02.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Trying to think who else was there.

start time: 944:47:06.000
end time: 945:10:26.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Like tonight's presentation.

start time: 945:12:18.000
end time: 947:02:20.000
confidence: 0.91
F: Not the presentation, no, but the steps, the steps that, that are unlisted on here, they've seen those.

start time: 947:20:40.000
end time: 952:56:00.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I'm curious in here. One of the things the district said it was going to do is start the strategic planning committee. So I'm just curious said that they started. So which one start. Which one started and like how many meetings did they have? Because there was some really specific ask from the, from the building leaders.

start time: 952:58:00.000
end time: 953:24:10.000
confidence: 0.85
E: Right, right.

start time: 953:24:50.000
end time: 963:19:02.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So the strategic, the strategic plan committees are the Customer Service, Strategic Alignment, High Quality Teaching Learning, Black Student Excellence, Inspiring Learning Spaces and Support for Team tps. And so from those committees we gathered principal representation on all those. So at least each committee has at least met once from last year. Since last year, full transparency. So but the idea is that those will be revamped moving forward to meet obviously more than once from last year.

start time: 963:22:06.000
end time: 966:57:26.000
confidence: 0.86
A: I'm just curious on the folks that either rolled it or participate in this. What are they feeling of if this stuff have been implemented and been helpful?

start time: 967:00:38.000
end time: 980:30:16.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Yeah. So one of the things I would say so if you were to say like the affinity space, like for example, because we had a few folks who were in the affinity space who just appreciate that piece, the one that you talk about, the one last one that we just did and one of the things that we're going to be doing because like I mentioned about checks. So if you think about the common themes in the school listening sessions, the idea is we will do that again at the end of this year. So we'll have the Successful School Survey and focus kind of just listening pieces and in particular for me with the aoc we're going to set up there's a focus group or survey, maybe a combination of both. Specific to the themes. Right. Because if we're thinking about benchmarks, where we're at progress wise, we want to be able to report progress on the specific themes that we mentioned.

start time: 980:32:08.000
end time: 985:08:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: I'm glad you brought that up because last year when we had the conversation that was supposed to been happening already as far as progress monitoring. So from here what you're saying that we want to do that now, but then, I mean the whole year has last where we haven't had that. And then I asked, am I right?

start time: 985:10:30.000
end time: 985:42:54.000
confidence: 0.97
F: I would say specific to the themes.

start time: 985:45:02.000
end time: 985:56:10.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Right.

start time: 986:27:50.000
end time: 987:25:02.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Specific to the themes in regards to like having a focus group or.

start time: 987:25:26.000
end time: 987:53:30.000
confidence: 0.92
B: That type of thing we can do.

start time: 988:02:30.000
end time: 994:54:24.000
confidence: 0.93
F: But using like papsa, using the Successful School survey. We were very transparent with the Successful School survey and the, and that geared us. And then also we also had those, those building leader sessions, those opportunities to provide input and feedback last year, now this year.

start time: 994:55:52.000
end time: 995:39:28.000
confidence: 0.81
A: And those will focus for administrators of color.

start time: 995:42:24.000
end time: 997:06:24.000
confidence: 0.85
F: Those are focused about the Successful Schools piece was for all was for everybody.

start time: 997:07:12.000
end time: 997:47:12.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So not really focused on administrators of color.

start time: 997:48:16.000
end time: 998:08:00.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Not specifically.

start time: 998:09:20.000
end time: 1001:31:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: And so why are we bringing, why are we talking about that if this is specifically for color? Well, and you're saying, well this is for everybody. Well then that's again, it's not focused on administrators of color.

start time: 1001:37:20.000
end time: 1002:33:40.000
confidence: 0.96
F: And I would say that this is a piece that we're moving forward with this year.

start time: 1002:46:40.000
end time: 1026:56:32.000
confidence: 0.97
G: So last year when we brought this up, I, I asked the question of why aren't the people that took the survey that did this, that did this audit, why aren't they leading the conversation? Why are we coming back to the table and they are not here to facilitate the conversation around this is how things are going, this is what we're going to be doing and this is what it's looking like. This is who we're going to be working with. At that time, I believe I asked Jonathan, who were they going to be reporting to. And we didn't have a name to who they were going to be reporting to because I wanted to find out who's going to be accountable for whether or not this, this fails or succeeds. And no name was given but that we would, we were going to be committing to like making sure that, that this happens. Specific to equity, the equity audit. I don't care about the successful school survey. Because that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the equity audit. The equity audit is not the successful school survey. This is very specific to the. The administrators and the teachers of color specifically. So don't lump us in with everybody else because you, you, you make us insignificant. I'm sorry, it. It is what it is. But don't lump us in with everybody else. This was an equity audit.

start time: 1026:57:36.000
end time: 1027:41:20.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Right, but administrators of color are also taking the survey.

start time: 1027:42:40.000
end time: 1027:53:04.000
confidence: 0.89
F: How are you.

start time: 1027:54:32.000
end time: 1028:53:06.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Are you invalid validating their voice when they take that survey?

start time: 1028:54:58.000
end time: 1029:57:22.000
confidence: 0.89
G: I want we doing. We were doing an equity audit.

start time: 1029:59:46.000
end time: 1030:04:02.000
confidence: 0.65
F: So.

start time: 1030:04:26.000
end time: 1035:06:26.000
confidence: 0.93
G: And the administrators of color, they're taking that as part of a larger group. We're saying as a part of this. This solely about this. I'm solely wanting to hear about your experience, like how you're. How your dealings at work. How do you feel at work?

start time: 1035:07:38.000
end time: 1035:13:54.000
confidence: 0.73
B: How.

start time: 1035:15:22.000
end time: 1040:40:36.000
confidence: 0.98
G: Where are you Solely amongst you. Do we realize that black people are the only people that have to say black? And it's the only ones Latino network has their own thing, Pacific Islanders, Asian Americans. When it comes to black people, we have to say black and brown or black and something else.

start time: 1040:42:28.000
end time: 1040:53:20.000
confidence: 0.53
B: I.

end time: 1052:00:06.000
confidence: 0.90
A: I'm reading some of the questions that was on the audit. And I don't know if they lined up with, I will say successful school survey. And. And are those successful school surveys it disaggregated so you can pull that off? Well, these teachers of color. So in this way, doing a successful school survey.

start time: 1052:03:18.000
end time: 1081:49:56.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Successful school survey is specifically around building leadership. And so from a disaggregation, they can with any survey list. Have you guys done that? Have you done that and disaggregation? Yeah, absolutely, we've done that piece. And I also say this too, and maybe we can get to some of the actual pieces because back to. So mind you, some of the checks, a lot of the checks that we are doing, and a lot of the system pieces, we have built in individual pieces from a check and balance piece. So in other words, we shouldn't have to get together all administrators of color to get a feel for your experiences. So for example, our senior directors of schools. Right. Which right now have currently 812 schools right on their caseload. Okay. Our principal coaches who are not senior directors are also aligned with our OSP department in regards to supporting. We've been very specific about having our like for example principal coaches of color. We have two African American principal coaches and they work specifically. Right. Because that was something that was feedback from our black principals new principles that they wanted to see that. So we've been very strategic and so we have weekly meetings. Okay. Not as an OSP team. And so those themes would absolutely come up during that time. Right. Because we talk about these pieces all the time. So I would say it doesn't. It should not and will not should have to result on surveys or focus groups, that type of thing. There's immediacy of day to day types of things that we're doing that can lend us an ear to how we are doing from a system perspective.

start time: 1081:53:08.000

start time: 1089:04:10.000
end time: 1094:45:38.000
confidence: 0.91
F: In reference to the themes I'm going to mention that will be in reference to the specific themes. But I was trying to talk to more so to director Hollins question about, you know, what are. How do we know if we're not having a focus group survey or that type of thing because of the system.

start time: 1094:46:34.000
end time: 1103:03:42.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Pieces that's coming through that you want to hear directly from. Is your experience different? Right. You recap the themes from two years ago. We haven't gotten into the couple slides of all the strategies activities that have taken place over the last year and a half or two. I'm assuming you've seen what those are. We talk about any one of them. But what you really want to know is is it better? You know, you want to hear that. You want to hear some indication of that by gathered feedback from about because.

start time: 1103:04:06.000
end time: 1109:01:34.000
confidence: 0.88
A: That'S literally in part of theme seven. Feedback falls flat. And that's literally one of their themes that you know, there's. There's no action taken, there's no feedback given. And I'm asking them why would they say hey, is it getting better for them? I'm asking because that's the whole point of the Audit. So it can get better for. Is it getting better for them?

start time: 1109:03:02.000
end time: 1111:02:22.000
confidence: 0.98
F: Yeah, we want to see, you know, as we move forward through the year, given the pieces that we've been doing.

start time: 1111:04:06.000
end time: 1113:18:24.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Getting better for them. And if you can't answer that get it, then that's, that's what, that's what the answers. That's what we trying to get to. Is it getting better?

start time: 1117:45:52.000
end time: 1124:43:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Which is interesting because only one person on this who did this report is still here and they left for different. And I've talked to most of them. So it's interesting that you say, well, you think it is getting better. But the people who actually did the report, only one of them is still here and the other ones left for multiple reasons. But a lot of it was because of the stuff that happened in this auto report is still happening because this.

start time: 1126:54:38.000
end time: 1130:31:40.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I get that. Once again, the goal is you say it's getting better, but everybody who started on Working List is not here for reasons associated with the same report. That's a problem.

start time: 1130:38:00.000
end time: 1134:39:10.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I don't know necessarily if that's why they're that piece for that group in particular. So we hired 17 principals this year. We had to hire 32 last year.

start time: 1134:41:10.000
end time: 1135:00:46.000
confidence: 0.94

A: I've talked to them personally.

start time: 1135:35:42.000
end time: 1138:28:14.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Well, so, but if you bring back to the group, if you come back to the group that presented last year, every situation was different in terms of why.

start time: 1138:31:02.000
end time: 1138:44:10.000

A: I know.

start time: 1139:22:46.000
end time: 1147:09:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So this is interesting to me because I talk to them, so you can't tell me anything that I don't already know why they left. So it's like you're trying to say, well, they didn't know. I literally talked to them. And it goes back to what Jonathan said. Yeah, it's toxic environment. They fit on. They get rapport from leadership. I get that. I'm just asking what are we going to do about it? Because once again, it's been a year and you can't tell me if it's getting better.

start time: 1147:34:40.000
end time: 1148:41:54.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Well, I can tell you I feel like it's getting better and where's the.

start time: 1148:42:02.000
end time: 1148:58:10.000
confidence: 1.00
A: Data to back that up.

start time: 1148:58:50.000
end time: 1152:33:10.000
confidence: 0.90
B: I have data that I'll be happy to show on my screen right now to show you to go back to student the successful school survey. This has African American. Yes it does. It has everybody.

start time: 1152:45:30.000
end time: 1153:40:30.000
confidence: 0.87
F: Why do we not want to hear what African American people say in this fiscal school?

start time: 1153:49:30.000
end time: 1159:57:22.000
confidence: 0.91
A: I'm just curious if the questions on this was for everybody. It wasn't eager to hey, do I feel like I have to code switch on the successful school survey director? It doesn't talk about a as people of color when you look at some of these other things. Well, we feel like we're getting held accountable to a higher standard than anyone else. Is that addressed on the successful school? Those specific questions.

start time: 1159:58:26.000
end time: 1190:45:40.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I think there. So there are specific questions. I agree. That would not necessarily to say that this is not an indicator in terms of how folks are feeling. So mind you, The Equity Audit 2 was done with focus groups. Right Folks we have currently if you're talking about building administrators, we have about 68 building administrators will come the focus groups that were done during the Equity audit had groups of four, had groups of six. Had groups of eight. All I'm saying is we use this as well in conjunction. I agree and that's what I said that we are going to be more specific with the actual themes and collect data on those specific specific themes. But we do use this like this is an important piece to gauge on how we are doing with our leaders of color. And then we also again use focus groups that we which we did have several administrators of color attempt last year. Maybe it wasn't necessarily the specific group but I would say like people like Carmen. You know folks, I can't remember all in all who was here but there are also other sessions of feedback opportunities in regards like papsa. Like for example we have several administrators of color on PAPSA from last year and that is a feedback loop and feedback opportunity. So he can go back to the slide. So just to. To highlight some things in terms of actionable pieces that we have done to address the themes. Again this is in conjunction with all of our departments. So osp, otl, OSS and absolutely resj.

start time: 1191:12:40.000
end time: 1193:02:24.000
confidence: 0.79
A: And anything that you're going to present is this specific to administration or is this abroad?

start time: 1193:03:12.000
end time: 1211:33:04.000
confidence: 0.94
F: For these are very specific steps. Right. That we have taken which address the just an over overwhelming feeling of lack of support. Right. And those pieces like the community approach. So I think so if we go on to the next slide. So our racial. Our recipe work if you think big picture. Right. Because we're Thinking about sustainability. So the development of an equity centered leader is extremely important. So with recipe, what we're doing is we're creating leadership standards, principal standards and principal supervisor standards with an equity centered profile. Right. And so with the creation of an equity equity center profile, we can be more specific and strategic with professional development and support because these will be the expectations that we'll have for all leaders. Right. And then also as we're hiring people into the system that is also going to help us in terms of what does the onboarding look like?

start time: 1211:34:32.000
end time: 1212:22:08.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Can you dive into a little what that equity center profile looks like?

start time: 1212:23:04.000
end time: 1212:33:00.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Sure.

start time: 1213:04:40.000
end time: 1215:11:40.000
confidence: 0.97
F: So I have it. So I can send it to you. I just had it pulled up.

start time: 1215:44:50.000
end time: 1216:23:38.000
confidence: 0.90
B: If you send it to me, I can screen.

start time: 1216:26:34.000
end time: 1231:55:40.000
confidence: 0.94
E: This is the Wallace foundation funded work. We're working with the two higher ed institutions so that they are developing a candidate pool of school leaders that actually have a racial equity mindset, that are better equipped, that have those leadership domains to serve effectively in our district, particularly for underserved students. The partnership I think is unique in that. Not only is it with two local colleges, but it's also been working with Oregon's tsbc. So professional licensure. And so it's actually altering the overall state system for making sure that the folks that are being granted licensure have some background in some of these topic areas. And so, you know, it's been really fascinating work for leading statewide. We're trying to meet our own need for a particular profile of school eater.

start time: 1232:05:20.000
end time: 1244:31:46.000
confidence: 0.94
F: These are the domains so you can see. I know it's kind of hard to see a little bit larger. So through our recipe work foundationally this is what we would call the organ leader. This is what our PPS leader profile will be. And so this has been in conjunction with. Through our OSP or PLL department. We have from again every single department and we do have obviously building leader voice in particular building leaders of color who have been immersed and involved in this work and the creation of this. It's a draft. Right. But this will in a sense set a foundation as we think big picture long term.

start time: 1244:34:18.000
end time: 1245:01:50.000
confidence: 0.94

start time: 1245:52:54.000
end time: 1250:18:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: This is something. Yeah. This will be a foundation for like the development of principal standards and principal supervisor standards. Right. So. And once. Right. Once we socialize this, this will can become the foundation for pd.

C: So one thing just about the successful school survey. I do know that when Carmen was the head of PAPSA that they were instrumental in getting administrative questions on the survey and I'm wondering whether to Director Holmes and Greens comment weather with more specificity questions on the survey can be asked because I know they viewed that as a way for them to quite frankly anonymously provide feedback into the system. But as a to get another data another specific data point and that's not at all a reason to say I mean I I from my perspective I'd like to see more measurable like instead of activities more just more measurable like here like I'm not sure what 17 new principles as opposed to 32 means because it may be we retained every principle of color we lost.

start time: 1279:53:10.000
end time: 1280:20:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: So yeah that's true.

start time: 1280:53:10.000
end time: 1283:47:10.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Understanding of the metrics before like another year goes by of to answer the question of what whether example things are getting better and whether it's directly tied back to the issues that were raised.

start time: 1284:19:30.000
end time: 1284:29:14.000
confidence: 0.53
F: And then you.

end time: 1291:02:28.000
confidence: 0.94
F: No I appreciate that Director. So again so just if we just go I don't know if you want to go down this list specifically if you just want to but I just want to highlight a few things on this first slide and then move to the second slide.

start time: 1291:05:24.000
end time: 1291:49:24.000
confidence: 0.84
A: I think one of the Dr. Depath has a question.

start time: 1291:50:52.000
end time: 1296:02:12.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Thank you. I was as I was reading through the materials and trying to understand some of the conditions for administrators of color. One of the things that I know just anecdotally is that the parents in the building make it really hard for principals of color.

start time: 1296:03:16.000
end time: 1296:14:18.000
confidence: 0.77
F: Sure.

start time: 1296:17:24.000
end time: 1308:59:04.000
confidence: 0.93
D: I mean they're part of the landscape that make it very difficult. In fact, I mean I hear from parents say some terrible things about our administrators of color being really bad at every level. At every level. Neighbors parents talking really badly about black principals, for instance get that regularly Latina principals and I'm sure that that contributes. You know, if you're a building leader and you've got people in your community that aren't supportive, that's got to also contribute to why people But I didn't see that addressed so I just wanted to bring that to the floor because I know that's got to be problematic.

start time: 1309:01:12.000
end time: 1366:50:40.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Yeah, no, I appreciate that direction. I just want to highlight just a few of these bullets in terms of support. So our PLO department learning within the Office of School Performance is a huge support. It's our professional leadership and learning department within our Office of School Performance. So they work. So within our PLL department, our principal coaches and those are not senior directors of schools. Right. There's a lot of research around senior principal supervisors and principal coaches. So we have been very specific about making sure there's a support. And so our principal coaches work specifically with our new leaders. When I say new leaders within the first three years and I don't know if you know this, so we so 62% of our building leaders or first three years, so they have and are involved in this program. And the principal coaches are tied directly to a senior Director of Schools cohort. And so they are asked to participate in and you can see it here in Professional Leadership and Learning in new leader induction or new principal induction which we have quarterly meetings within pll. We're also launching an inspiring Leadership program as well and Future Principals program. But those leadership induction pieces have been supports for our leaders for all our leaders from a principal coach perspective. Like I mentioned before, we've been very specific in terms of mining support affinity wise because that was an ask specifically for our black principles. And so that was a support piece as well. But I just wanted to highlight because that's a piece in terms of supports given our relatively new principle which we're expecting to keep in state. Also, I want to note this last bullet in regards to our leadership model this year. So like I mentioned earlier, leadership is where we bring all the principles together. So we are so during this time. So if you think about support for our leaders of color. So we do affinity space during this time, which is important, which is something that from a that perspective. And we collect feedback after every session which is something that they've appreciated. We are also engaging in coming back to racial equity work from a baseline perspective because we know how important pieces collectively as a whole group. And then when we do that type of work, then that gives us an opportunity to differentiate within affinity space. The PD Advisory group also gives which is another feedback loop, gives us feedback from a leadership steering committee on what supports are needed during leadership development, specifically during Leadership Institute. So I just wanted to highlight a few things on this page.

start time: 1367:07:00.000
end time: 1371:05:24.000
confidence: 0.86
A: And there's so many things that we're addressing with this with these leaderships. The professional leadership and learning is some of the Things that, like, one of the themes is characteristics of white dominant culture. Just some of those things getting addressed.

start time: 1371:06:12.000
end time: 1371:12:20.000
confidence: 0.86
F: Yes.

start time: 1371:13:40.000
end time: 1372:46:12.000
confidence: 0.87
A: And then how is it getting addressed and what measures are we going to. Yeah, so what that is being addressed.

start time: 1372:47:16.000
end time: 1400:49:10.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Yeah. So a big piece with that part is engaging in racial. Racial equity work together as a whole group of. So last year we had white account. We called it white accountability space, and we have affinity space. The feedback from last year from our leaders of color, specifically, they wanted to engage collectively as an entire group from a racial equity perspective. So in terms of addressing kind of that theme, white dominant culture, so to speak, and engaging in those collective conversations and activities is something that we're working on this year based on the feedback last year. Because one of the things that we find too, as leaders of color, a lot of times when you are in the building, you find that, like, if a racial incident occurs or if something else occurs, there's this feeling like, because you are the person of color or the leader of color, that, okay, that you are the one. People always will go to you and ask questions. What do you think in regards to this? And that's an added burden that folks feel. And so when we can engage collectively, more so in this work and get to a level of understanding, it can't be all on our administrators of color. This is our collective work together. And it's by no fault or harm that people don't want that white fragility, in a sense, kind of comes into play and leading to situations like that, which in turn then lead to again this feeling of just not supported. Right.

F: You know, still kind of early to tell from a feedback perspective, but I mean, we'll know more after the end of this year. We also do feedback, like I said, we do feedback after every leadership session. But from our first session that we initially had, people appreciated the time together, collectively as a whole. We did an activity in August around identity. Right. And just being comfortable sharing who you are, what you believe, and all that getting learned, learn about each other collectively as a group, administrators of color, everybody, right. And that people appreciated that level of opportunity to do those types of things.

A: I know. I'm sure you know this as well as everyone here. You know, when you have those, it's one thing to have the Action, Right. It's one thing to have the cruise. It's one thing to talk about it. The important thing is also having some action behind it. Like, what did that look like systematically? What did that look like? You know, when you talk about, you know, white dominant culture, are you talking about not support, what mechanisms are we using, what things are we talking about to, you know, to address that? And what things are we putting in place to do that? No, it's one thing that we can talk and talk about racism, we can talk about it all day long. But if we don't put things together in place to address that, then they go back to these same type of feelings. It's like, oh, well, we talk about it, but nothing happens.

start time: 1431:55:22.000
end time: 1520:58:00.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Yeah. And our piece. And that's where we see. So each. If you think about the skips, which are foundational a school success, right. Skips are the plan. So the skips encompass two academic goals and a climate and culture goal. The climate and culture goal, a lot of them center around. It could be a different things, but they use the successful school survey. They use behavior data, right? And if you take a look at successful school survey, like for example, if I were to take a question from the climate culture, like sense of belonging, like for students is a big piece that a lot of schools hone in on, right? Because we know that if you don't have sense of belonging, there's something going on from a cultural perspective. And a lot of it can stem from a lot of things, just a feeling of inclusion, implicit bias, those types of things. And so they have outlined specific steps to address that climate goal that they have in each one of their skills. So those are specific actual items. And I would also say too that they've also utilized the Resj department to help with even some of the tougher conversations, let's say around racialized incidents that happen in buildings and those types of things. And so the climate goal from each skip is a measurable, actionable. It's always going to have goals. The strategies incorporated type of data is a measurable piece that schools move forward with. And I would also say too, like, the idea of what we're doing in leadership is to support the implementation strategies. That was good. If we can go to the next slide. And I just want to highlight a few things here too. So I would say this too. So if you talk to building, a lot of times frustration maybe won't necessarily come from say like a senior director of schools is not being supportive in that or I'm not getting the Professional development that I want type of thing. A lot of the issues of frustration can stem from I got this, this, this and this to do. Who do I call, right? Like, or I have something in HR that is due something the piece from facilities or I have this kind of piece. And so one of the things that we really have looked to do not only last year, but especially this year, is to create clarity. Because being a principal, right, is not just about being instructional leader. It's not just being about those pieces. You have to know how to manage a building and you have to know how to deal with crisis and you want to do those types of things or who do you call? Who are your point to that? And so we really have tried to make some strides to increase that level of clarity of who your point person is. Because there's nothing more frustrating as a former building principle, not knowing who to call number one or I call the wrong person and that person sends me on a different wild goose chase to find what my answer is going to be. That's a piece in terms of support that we would try to in terms of clarity of point people and also clarity of roles. And it would be remiss of me if I didn't mention, I did mention this already before, but it's significant in terms of our caseloads for senior directors of schools. You know, last year due, we have, we have one senior director of schools who had 18 schools. And that's really hard to provide the level support for building leaders. And so honing in on that and making some decisions so that we can have manageable loads for our senior directors. Because they're not just principal supervisors, right? They are principal coaches in a sense as well. So that's important. Also I talked about this too, just a little bit, but efficacy with the entire a central office department. So when you can have a cohort of schools and a representative from say the Office of Teaching and Learning, the Office of Student Support Service, tied in a principal coach tied to a specific cohort of schools so they know who point people are in reference to those departments. That has been. Has been significant, right? Moving forward, it just comes back again to that clarity of roles who you talk to in reference to support. I talked about the affinity group pieces this year as well, is the creation of a principal advisory committee. And the principal advisory committee is a rep from each cohort meeting with myself and a rep from, well, the chief Academic Officer, Chief of Student Support Service, Chief of Facilities and Chief of HR monthly together. More important, feedback on how it's going.

F: It does because what we're talking about is support for global leaders and with the groups that. With the principals who have been. We're going to be on this. We. We have representatives. We have representatives, number one from each cohort from all levels. But then we also have administrators. Right. And so this will give an opportunity for us to talk about how it's going specifically to the equity audit.

E: Dr. Proctor, I know you've been listening to the conversation. I'm not sure if you want to weigh in regarding our efforts to support our admin of Color.

start time: 1554:06:30.000
end time: 1578:43:20.000
confidence: 0.97
H: Yes, thank you. So as I've been listening in, it's important for us to note that when implementing the particular systems that we are talking about that it takes the effort of implementation but also cycles of continued feedback to determine how it's working and how it's working well for our leaders of color. And I hear that as a major concern with the efforts, they're really targeted at building those out of those themes, the sense of belonging. Belonging, but also building the capacity. So it was noted that where there may be a void due to some of the themes, we are making efforts on two ends to address the specific concerns and also building the capacity of our leaders as they. As they continue to lead through our system so that. So that they can definitely provide, you know, those equitable supports and we can. And provide us the feedback necessary so that we can continue to meet those objectives that are outlined in the survey.

F: Dr. Walker, last slide. And so from a leadership development perspective for Leadership Institute, just highlighting that we are really honing in on instructional leadership, racial equity and then leading forward through change. So that's a common through line for building leader development. And that's also done in conjunction with our partnership with RESJ also because our building leaders of color are not just principals. Right. They're AP VPs and so. And they're also aspiring principals. And I talked a little bit about the work of professional leadership and learning piece also we've adjusted leadership so that all our AP's and VPs can attend. Right. Because that was a, that was a tough piece last year. And so we've adjusted to make sure that our leadership, our big leadership sessions are done on non school days. So that's a big piece where everybody can attend and participate collectively together they still get, you know, what they missed if they're unable to attend because we have separate apart and VP needs working with them, but also for the larger leaderships having non student links, we have our first one hopefully in November and then align comprehensive and differentiated RESJ professional learning opportunities. So RESJ has been a huge partner with this into our work support with our administrators of.

end time: 1620:40:20.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yes, we are the exit surveys for folks who leave. Yes, we are gathering that data. And that is a piece that we look at as Office of School Performance because it is a goal for every senior director of schools. Right. It's a goal retention of all administrators.

end time: 1640:50:00.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Well, success ultimately at the end is retention. Right. Especially retention of our leaders income. That's ultimately going to be the piece that we'll look at. That's going to be a huge barometer. Also like I mentioned earlier in terms of focus groups specifically around these themes, I really like suggestion about can we tailor some of the successful schools questions centered around these themes. I think that could be a big benchmark in regards to success. But ultimately it is about not only how they're feeling in reference to those questions. But ultimately are they leaving or are they staying? That's going to be.

start time: 1642:03:00.000
end time: 1665:30:10.000
confidence: 0.97
H: Something I wanted to also add is that as we continue to have the conversations, continue to implement our plan and have conversations with our leaders of color to understand the impact and the results that we're getting in align to the exit surveys, that there's something that we have that we are mindful of when it comes to the rate of change or the rate of improvement compared to the rate of the initial impact or harm. So as it was raised, you know, some of those and many of the original leaders of color that took the survey may not be with the system any longer. But that kind of reinforces why we need to take these particular steps to ensure that we are, as we acquire and hire through our pipeline more administrators of color. How we are able to support them and provide the level of care necessary for them to feel successful and feel supported in their role is going to really determine the rate that we are able to make the change needed to have a sustained experience for our leaders.

E: So we want to be able to query for that, you know, in different ways. You know, not just a survey. You want to hear from them directly. You want to have groups, you want to have them say, here's what's feeling better, here's what's not. Leaders of color in this room, they could share with you their experience too, you know, and. And what does support look like and what creates that kind of. Of climate and culture where folks could be themselves, their best selves within a diverse school system. So, you know, that's. That's what we really want. We want. And we want them to, you know, be content doing the hard, challenging work here in the district to lift up our students of color in particular. This is why we really focused on the equity centered leadership, because every leader needs to do that color or background they bring to the equation.
