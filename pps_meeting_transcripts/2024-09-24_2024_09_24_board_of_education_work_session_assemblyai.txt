A: All right. We are transitioning into our work session on the superintendence evaluation template. Good. Board members, you have a draft in front of you that is a result of Vice Chair DePass and I meeting with Superintendent Armstrong and looking at a template recommended by school partners. Using that template, we took our board goals, Superintendent Armstrong's priorities, and our desired characteristics that we identified when we drafted the superintendent profile to create this draft tonight. I hope that we can agree on a template on the template before we move to the data required to measure progress. We also want to decide on the timeline and the cadence for any check ins throughout the year. Everyone ready?

start time: 22:44:10.000
end time: 22:59:50.000
confidence: 0.54
B: Yep.

start time: 23:08:10.000
end time: 31:08:12.000
confidence: 0.95
A: All right, Discuss away. Just. I want also just kind of a quick reminder. These are just the goals. Right. And then as the board decides on the goals, that's when we can reiterate what I just read here. That's when we can start discussing or getting looking into what kind of data would provide feedback for those goals. Want to make sure we set the target first before we start doing the work.

start time: 31:11:16.000
end time: 38:03:16.000
confidence: 0.94
D: So just a quick question. When you sent it out, you asked board members if we had suggestions to send it back. We're just starting. Those were just sent to you, but nothing's, nothing's been incorporated or anything. Yeah, this is just for us to discuss. So we didn't really need to send stuff. I mean, if we send some things, we need to raise it.

start time: 38:05:48.000
end time: 41:34:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, because I think one of the issues was that if people were sending it to me, it could spark a serial conversation, which. Right. Yeah, that was my mistake.

start time: 43:01:00.000
end time: 60:13:50.000
confidence: 0.94
D: So I'll just jump onto the first page on the goals. What are the baseline numbers? So we had. I'm looking at the two columns of the results. So we had baseline numbers for each of those. Are we reestablishing those and if so, what are they? I mean, assuming they are what they are, whatever the baseline numbers and then the ratings we had agreement on or in the other evaluation. Basically, if there was X amount of, say, increase in third grade reading in the subgroup, it would correspond to one of these categories. And so because the column is blank. Curious. Are we carrying over those from the last evaluation of like what we had already set?

start time: 61:44:10.000
end time: 63:39:50.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So my understanding, my understanding is that this is a new template and we're starting fresh with a new superintendent.

start time: 63:54:50.000
end time: 72:24:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Okay. But I guess there's nothing there. So my question is, I'm just asking it like are we going to use a similar methodology which is so for example third grade reading to get to an exceeds expectation. We had a scale which is like 0 to 5 increase was you know, does not meet the expectations say or if it was an increase of 1 to 2 percentage it was meets expectations. I'm just.

start time: 72:31:00.000
end time: 72:45:48.000
confidence: 0.84
B: Scale.

start time: 72:48:44.000
end time: 74:14:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yeah. So there's no scale. And I'm asking are we going to use something like we had before or.

start time: 74:47:00.000
end time: 86:22:32.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah, that's a great question. And may I ask and perhaps maybe this is a great place to just maybe restart and start. Just want to acknowledge our chief of all the things research, accountability, assessment, racial equity and justice. Yes, all of that. Dr. Adams. Dr. Adams was instrumental in using the template and putting the language in and I was just wondering if he could just give a quick little just frame of the content that's in and then some thoughts and then he's also here as a resource too. Dr. Adams.

start time: 86:23:36.000
end time: 134:21:50.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Sure. I believe Director DePass, it was you who shared this template from school board partners with the superintendent for consideration as the. For consideration as the evaluation template. One of the things and so this is set out in two sections and is designed as I understood it and read through the school board partner materials as a evaluation that would look at evidence and then form a judgment based on that evidence, which is different than the previous template which was which did turn things into a little bit of a mathematics problem. And so this template didn't really lend itself to that same mathematical jigsaw. So that wasn't necessarily included. But as Director Wong said and mentioned, we did identify four goal. Four. Right. Four priority goal areas. And then we did think it would be with Chair Wong and Vice Chair depass feedback advantageous to talk about when it talks about core competencies and descriptions to talk about those core competencies that the superintendent search revealed. From all of the feedback and engagement with community and others to that regard in terms of to director's question about evidence for the board goals. We will continue to provide updates on the board goals. For example, when the OSAS embargo is lifted. It was scheduled to be lifted this Thursday. They just notified us that it's not lifting on Thursday and it'll be sometime in October. But as we bring the for example the OSAS data, we will talk about the 3rd, 5th and 8th grade board goals and late January or early February when depending on the release of the graduation data, we'll talk about that graduation board goal. And also the post readiness board goal. So as I experience the template and the materials that were surrounding the template, it would be. My understanding is just as a principal or supervisor would be gathering and collecting evidence along the way to go into the evaluation, the board would be gathering that same evidence along the way to go into the superintendent's evaluation template. And my other understanding is that Superintendent Armstrong would have the ability to do a self evaluation and then the board would do an evaluation and then the board would come to some kind of consensus around what her actual evaluation and rating would be.

start time: 134:37:20.000
end time: 155:40:50.000
confidence: 0.95
B: That's correct. The other thing about this, so it doesn't on the. There's no mention of financial stability like our last template had. And I don't know how important that is for people. But this is intended to be a co creation between the superintendent and the board, not a punitive document. It's literally meant to identify areas for growth and recognize positive attributes and growth along the curve in terms of student achievement. The best practices for the use of this particular template are to have regular cadence of meetings with the superintendent. So every quarter there would be a meeting between the board leadership and the superintendent where we're talking about measurement. We're looking at data along. So it's not a big lift at the end of the year. It's also intended for all of us now tonight to provide input anything that we think is missing. I think the scales would be important to put in there so we have something to measure. It needs to be have a quantitative aspect to it.

F: The district whenever we get a chance. I just want to note that my hand is up, so. Just throwing it out there.

D: Go ahead.

start time: 169:18:50.000
end time: 237:15:42.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yes. So I just want to be clear on like when we started looking at it, when we start thinking about numbers and how to come up with something. I'm. I'm. I'm from a real low level layman's type term. The whole point of doing this for me is that within our school district we got a bunch of illiterate black kids running around. We got. We got a bunch of people saying that we got great kids and we got wonderful kids. And at the end of the day these kids can't read and they can't do math and they're graduating without without being able to read. And we can say whatever we want to say. But at the end of the day, I talk to parents that are telling me that their kids are leaving high school and they can't read. And so the whole point of this, this tool, in my mind, is that we would establish a baseline where we can get in front of this and we can begin to say unequivocally that this is what we are intentionally going to be doing to ensure that every student that leaves PPS is going to be able to read and do math. So I'm not here to. In my. So in my humble opinion, what I. What I want to get to at the end of the day, and I'm just pointing this, just throwing this all out there because she just got here. Kimberly, just. Dr. Armstrong, just. Forgive me. I have no right to just call you Kimberly. Your name is Dr. Armstrong. And so Dr. Armstrong just got here. So I understand that we can't hold her to the same things that we were doing before. However, I don't want to lose focus on the point of this for me is that we get to the place to where we're stopped saying that our kids should be able to read at a proficient level by the end of third grade and that we get to the place where we saying that they will be able to read, because right now black kids are like 30% below white kids, if not more, in some areas. So do whatever you got to do. Call it however you want to call it. Say whatever you got to say. I don't care. At the end of the day, I need to make sure that black kids are reading, and I want to be very intentional about it. And I think we need to be scoring it because the thing that you measure gets results. And if we're not intentionally measuring it, then it's not important to us. And so call it whatever you want to call it, say whatever you want to say. But at the end of the day, we need to start regulating, and every meeting we need to be pointing out, this is what we're doing, and this is how we're ensuring that black kids are going to learn how to read and that they're going to be able to do math, and that when they leave here, they're going to have a diploma that means something. So I just want to be very clear on that. We need to say that at every meeting, and we haven't been saying it, and it bothers me. And so we need to be talking about the fact that our kids, a lot of our Black kids are illiterate and call the baby ugly. It is what it is. But until we start doing something about it, we just gonna be making excuses for why our kids aren't reading. And it's not Dr. Armstrong's fault. She didn't. She couldn't. She just. She's here. But the. This evaluation is because I want to. I want to tell her and I want to tell everybody that she works with that reading is important. Black kids being able to read. Black kids be able to do math backs, do science. That is an important. It is an important part of why we do what we do. And from the top down, we need to make it a priority. They should. We need to get away from the language that they should be and get to the language that says they will be, because that will. That will change everything that we do. And so I just want to say that, put that on the record because, yeah, I don't care about the blank spaces. Make sure the kids can read.

D: So I'm in agreement with Director Green. So I'm not ready to leave the board goals and the student outcomes that we set. I think it's, as Director Green suggested with the new superintendent, like, obviously we have like a baseline year, but I also think that if we're not, it would be a huge departure for us to decide that we're going to change the superintendent evaluation not to be focused primarily on student outcomes. And again, I think every superintendent and their first year, you get a baseline year. And then every new year, there's a discussion with the superintendent about sort of where we. The expectations on student growth. But I think we need to keep putting the baseline numbers in there so we know exactly where we are. I think one of. In the 2010s and 14s, the previous superintendent, there was a lot of outstanding evaluations. And if you looked at student outcomes that didn't reflect that. So for my preference, and I know there's other items in here, but that we continue to measure, but knowing with the calibration that this is a free first year. But to be clear, and if we were going to switch off of the student outcomes that we talked about, I think it necessitates sort of a separate maybe conversation because we've tried to orient our budget, our contracts aligned against that, and if that's not also what we're saying to the superintendent, it's like, this is where the focus should be, then I think that's a bigger conversation than just the template.

start time: 270:38:30.000
end time: 275:06:38.000
confidence: 0.98
E: So I like to make sure I'm following the Conversation correctly because we do have sort of priority one that says demonstrate improved achievement in accordance with the board goals. And I'm hearing board directors saying we're not focused on the board goals. And I'm just feeling a little confused.

start time: 275:08:14.000
end time: 282:14:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, I think nobody here wants to not measure achievement. I think everybody here wants to. Who is very concerned with that? Director Green. I mean, literally everyone here. So I don't think anybody's suggesting we don't measure anything or that we don't start with the baseline and measure from that baseline. I think rather we're just using a different tool so we have different outcomes.

start time: 282:42:30.000
end time: 289:28:49.000
confidence: 0.95
D: The way it's structured, I don't. It has goals and then results. So that my suggestion was that. That we have. We dropped the baseline. And I. And maybe I misunderstood. Dr. Adams. I mean, you said like throughout the year we'll be dropping these in, but it seems like we have baseline numbers from last year or like that we can drop in.

start time: 293:52:10.000
end time: 304:07:40.000
confidence: 0.96
D: And then on priority one, it has high school graduation. And originally we had sort of indicator college and career readiness data. And we've had lots of conversations as a board that high school graduation, since all you have to do is get a D, that that wasn't the sole measurement of our students being ready when they, when they left. So I would hope that we would have some of our college and career readiness indicators in here besides just graduation.

start time: 304:28:00.000
end time: 309:27:28.000
confidence: 0.96
E: So I. These are the current four board goals. Third grade, fifth grade, eighth grade, and high school graduation. And then there was also an agreement to report on post secondary readiness when the board adopted the goals for our students. So I mean, anything you all want can go into the template.

start time: 309:29:04.000
end time: 310:49:40.000
confidence: 0.91
G: Well, part of our board goals had 8th grade readiness. I didn't see that on the evaluation either.

start time: 311:02:00.000
end time: 317:37:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Can I ask about the baseline data? Just going back a little bit. So I think I heard you all say that last year's data would be first year baseline data for me. As opposed to what our students, where our students are at, our students this academic year with me, where they end up this spring.

start time: 318:19:20.000
end time: 321:29:02.000
confidence: 0.91
B: So we need to have some baseline. Right. So would the OCS data that's coming out soon, would that be the same as the end of the year data?

start time: 321:32:16.000
end time: 324:26:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: No, the OSAS data that's coming out soon would be data that was born out of the administration of Guadalupe Guerrero and Dr. Husk.

start time: 324:27:30.000
end time: 328:04:30.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Okay, so yeah, that will be the baseline. Yeah. What would you suggest as best practice in terms of establishing a fair baseline for year one?

start time: 328:16:10.000
end time: 331:27:50.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Well, I think what I'm inferring from Dr. Armstrong's question is whether or not the baseline can be based on a year of students under her administration.

start time: 331:45:30.000
end time: 332:15:46.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Right. Rather than someone else's.

start time: 332:17:38.000
end time: 338:55:00.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Well, I guess I'm thinking about it as far as that's the baseline of where our kids is at. It doesn't matter who administration it was. This is where our kids is at. And this we should be working place where we should be working from. For me, it doesn't really matter if we wait a year and do a baseline because, because our kids are at that today. And so for me, the baseline would be wherever they're at today moving forward.

start time: 339:06:40.000
end time: 359:31:18.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah. The only reason why I ask that though is because I get that point. However, then the evaluation is then based on the data that comes out this time next year during the transition year. And so all what I've been advised is that, and of course it's board's decision, but all what I've been advised is that the first year transitioning in is the year where, you know, you're collecting data, you're learning system. Then once that data is set, now being a year in, I have the opportunity to reset program and make some changes so that I can be impactful at growing the number. Because we know that what we have been doing hasn't been working. The data has shown us that over and over again. Maybe in some areas there are some, like our curriculum and some of the high leverage practices and some other systems and we're seeing some small growth in that. But we also know to get the numbers that we need, there's going to have to be some major disruptions. Those aren't disruptions that I'm making in this year as I'm learning the system and transitioning in. But I'm happy to, to lean into whatever number my question becomes.

start time: 359:32:54.000
end time: 386:07:50.000
confidence: 0.96
F: My question becomes then, because I want to, this is not about, this shouldn't be looked at as a penalization. Right. Like I, I want to know, like what is it that we're, what's fair, what's appropriate? And then keep in mind, keep in mind that if we're saying, okay, I need time to, to put this together, are we, what are we intentionally doing to make sure that kids can read at the end of this year? Like, I just want to be, we need to be very intentional about Making sure that we're doing. I don't want to wait a year and be like, okay, now I see that it's a problem. It's been a problem for like 25 years, if not longer. So we know that there's a problem. They're illiterate, they can't read. And I'm gonna keep saying that because it's true. The data says that it's true. The percentage of people, it is, it is not where it needs to be. And we need to call the baby ugly. It is what it is. What are we going to do? What, like, what is appropriate, what is sufficient for the first year? And I don't care if you come up with it. I don't care if you say, okay, this is what I plan to do the first year. This is how I'm going to do it. These are the level of gains that I believe that we should be able to see. And this is what I'm going to go. This is what I'm going to go after. And then whatever you feel like it is, then let's go with it. But we just can't, we can't just be okay with these illiterate kids running around here.

start time: 386:38:10.000
end time: 408:39:20.000
confidence: 0.95
G: I get what you're saying, and I just wanted to say, just because we say we're going to use these numbers as the baseline one, that's not like, it's not a penalization number. It's just this is where our kids is at. I think we have to really be honest with ourselves and know we know we're not going to always get to whatever the board goes of 5%, 3% every year, it might be 1%. So I think we, we have to have an understanding as well that just because we have a baseline with the kids are at now, we know it's going to take time to close those gaps. And I don't, I think we have to make sure we understand that we're not looking for, for instance, if, you know, the goal is 5% and we get 2% or 1.5%, that that's not a good thing. So I think we, I think we're, I don't know if we're reading this, reading in this way too much, but knowing that we're going to our kids is going to take time because they didn't, the gap didn't happen in one year or two years or five years. So I think we know that there is a level of timing that is going to take to close the gap for our kids because it's not just school. It's all social, economical variables and stuff as well. So I think if we not worry so much about what the number is this year versus the process we're going to use to get our kids to where they need to be.

confidence: 0.94
F: But that's what I'm saying. I don't. That's why I said I don't care about the number. I want to know what are we intentionally doing, right? Like, I feel like we need to spell that out for, for me and we need to spell that out for. For the community. Like the number. The number, it might fluctuate.

H: I'm going to agree with everything Gary said and I'm going to reframe it just a little bit because I think what you're hearing. Dr. Armstrong, everyone on this board wants to see growth as fast as we can, including this year. You, I know for a fact, want to see growth, including this year. I want to make sure we're not falling into. And I appreciate, you know, you're talking to folks that, you know, you want to be cautious in your first year, but I also want to make sure that we don't lose a year during the superintendent transition. Superintendent's turnover. I'm not suggesting you all, you're going to be here 10 or 20 years, but superintendents, on average turnover, like, every four or five years. I cannot believe that every four or five years you see a dip in student achievement. As you know, like, the whole point is to put those systems in place where you're seeing that constant improvement and that new leadership can come in. You might tweak things, you might make changes. And so I guess that's what I would say. I want to see the improvement. The community wants to see the improvement. Our kids need to see the improvement. So we have to use last year's data. You don't own last year's data. I don't know if last year's data went up or down. We're going to find that out sometime in October. You don't own that. But I do think you own what happens this year. I also think owning what happens this year and explaining the changes you're making, you know, as a result, those things can go hand in hand. So, I mean, personally, for me, I think as a board, we set the aggressive goals, right? And I don't remember exactly where they were. We go back to look at what they were. If it was 3%, 5% growth. I think you and your team strive as hard as you can to achieve that. If towards, you know, as we're going through the year, you're not seeing that, then that's also a time to have that conversation with us to say, hey, we're pushing really hard, we're not necessarily getting there. Here are the changes I'm making as a result of that. Right. And I'll just tell you as one board member, like that's a, that's an explanation, you know, as to why we're not there. But on the other hand, we have a lot of good systems in place that a lot of the team that you still have put in place. And I'm hoping those work well.

C: I appreciate that and I will say that I appreciate high expectations and aggressive goals. That's why I'm here. I also want to note, just as super superintendents change seats, so does board members. And so I want to make sure that whatever instrument we're designing and creating and crafting, that it's not setting it could potentially be a pitfall in the future. So I'm not saying lower the expectation or change, but I feel like it sounds like there's two things being described. One is a work plan and the other one is an evaluation template. And an evaluation in my mind is what it is. I'm either exceeding, I'm meeting or I'm failing. And that's the way that an evaluation tool should be used. Right. I appreciate opportunities to come together, have conversations, give updates. And at the end of the year it's did she make the mark or not?

G: And I think that's why it's important with Dr. I mean Director Burmet were saying, saying if we have those matrix for meets, particularly meets exceeds, well then that's how you get it. So for instance, if it's like it's 5.5, well, if you went up from point from zero to one point, that could be partly makes, if it goes up higher than that, that could be meats or whatever those matrix are to use that for that same, you know, evaluation process.

D: For a superintendent five years in is as Guadalupe's was, it's very different from a first year superintendent. But I, and I thank you and I'm in complete agreement with Andrew about the value of it. But I think it's that right hand column that could be different, say for a first year superintendent versus a superintendent who's in their third year, who's you know, drafted the budget, negotiated the contracts. So I think that's, that's where we take into that, that column is where we Take into account like sort of expectations of what you're doing that first year, but there's still expectation of moving, moving forward.

H: Can I just real quick. I actually don't like tying that scale to the achievement because I think there's.

H: I didn't like it we did with Guadalupe either. For me, my own perspective is we set board goals, maybe that's 5% and that's what we're all striving towards. If we hit the 5%, that's great. Clearly someone's gone, right? If we hit 1% or, you know, if we get flatter or down, we're all failing. It's not a you thing, that's a district failing. But if we get 1% growth, we set a target of 5. That doesn't mean I don't want to be, I don't want to be locked into, oh, I've agreed that that's a failing grade for the superintendent because you may come back and say with a whole bunch of explanations to all the things you've done and all the work, and I might say, you know what, that's an exceptional, that's an exceptional superintendent. Similarly, if we go 3 or 4%, but there, you know, for some reason we feel like there could have been more. Like, I want to be able to say, well, actually I feel like we didn't push hard enough. So just for me personally, I didn't like that. You know, we're going to pre establish what the rating is based on the goal. I think we set a goal, we try and achieve it, and then the evaluation is about how close did we get and why. And I want to be clear, we're not setting a goal for you, we're setting a goal for the districts and that's a goal for us as well. That also makes us complicit in terms of did you get what you needed for us to achieve that goal?

start time: 507:06:00.000
end time: 526:32:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I appreciate that. Sorry, just, just really quickly. I, I appreciate that. And, and I, I think that's meaningful and I just hope that, that there's some calibration so that it's not all completely subjective. Like, I, you know, some may disagree, but I, I actually like ratings and numbers because I want to be clear, when I set something, it's, it's like everyone agree, like based on our calibration and our agreement on this matter, she has either met or exceeded in the column. Otherwise it opens up a lot of subjective and, you know, boards transition and the next set come in and they may have different feelings about a 1% or a 2% or a 3%. So I think my only hope, and I hear that in the evaluation, I also have robust work plans and other things and other work that's happening with the team where our work is very focused and strategic. I just want to make sure that the instrument at the end of the year communicates clearly to me that all seven agree, whether it meets, exceeds or not, or fails or whatever the words are.

start time: 526:53:10.000
end time: 538:43:30.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yeah, I appreciate that too. And I appreciate you, Director Scott. So because we're non educators, not administrators, I'm also hesitant to use a number scale to determine success or not along, you know, meets or exceeds expectations. But rather I think we want to look at the data points and if the, you know, if the curve is going upwards, points between, you know, October 24th and October 25th, that there's a positive increase along a growth curve. So the more data points we have, we have a trend, we'll know if things are going up or down or stay flat.

start time: 538:49:10.000
end time: 553:52:30.000
confidence: 0.97
I: Yeah, that's what I was going to say too. And we have Dr. Adams who knows how to do this kind of testing to see if we're making progress or not. And that's what we want is progress. I don't think we have to set a percent. And we know that there's been so much going on with reading and with training the teachers and new curriculum, same with math. So we know things are happening now. Maybe there won't be any change. Maybe all those things that look wonderful to me anyway, maybe it's not going to make a difference and then we're going to have to rethink it. But right now, let's see what happens with all the stuff that Guadalupe brought that you're continuing. And you know, saying it has to be a certain percent seems ridiculous to me. But definitely we want to see growth. If we don't see growth, we know something's wrong.

start time: 554:19:30.000
end time: 561:09:40.000
confidence: 0.95
G: So just interesting that the conversation because like when we look at all kind of assessments, they're all part of percentage. So I don't have a school district. We use it for grades, right? We use it for, you know, sports, you know, all kind of percentages. So why would we move away from that if that's what we use now? Now maybe you change how you, you know, get to those percentages.

start time: 561:11:00.000

A: But if I. Well, I mean to answer that question, I mean like if you wrote a paper for English class, 10 page paper, and you got back and all said on it was C, you have no idea what you did right what you did, you did wrong. What you need to work on. Right. So, I mean, one of the things that is utmost important to me about evaluation, because otherwise I kind of feel it's a waste of time, is that an evaluation has to give feedback so that the superintendent knows how to grow. Right. It has to be repeatable, something you can do every year. So like, I'm going to use a basketball analogy because I know you play basketball, but like if I had someone taking stats on me and I was practicing and playing games, when I'm playing games and it showed like, you know, my free throws are 97%, but my three pointers are only 5%. Well, I got, I can lay off on practicing free throws for a while. I can now work on my three pointers. Sorry for the sports analogy. But I guess my question goes into. And this is for both Dr. Adams, Dr. Armstrong, if we just have a 10 page paper and you get back a c. You have no idea. Okay. I'm doing okay in this. You have no idea. So, like what. When we look at this template, my question is what are some goals here, competencies or whatever, that we can collect repeatable data that can show where growth is happening and where holes are happening, if that makes sense.

start time: 588:00:46.000

confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah, I appreciate it. And I do appreciate your analogy because I'm not going for a participation trophy. So I want to know that the game is being won. Right. Championship team. So the way that this instrument is laid out that there's four priorities and they're basically based on the strategic plan or for strategic prioritized areas. I don't think that that was before you all, before we layered in board goals under priority one that deals with student outcomes and then it brings in the three other priorities where we as a district team are hyper focused on the work. Right. So all the things happening around professional learning and developing a workforce and retention, like those are numbers. I would, I would love to be able to see and celebrate that how we're retaining staff and grow in that culture. There's also community engagement. I don't know if there's some surveys or perception data or some other quantifiable things that we can pull forth. But what this does is it pulls in all four of the areas that me and the team are already building work plans around and also layers in the board goals so that they're not two separate documents, but they're all infused together. That shows as a. It shows a comprehensive look towards just the goals that we're setting forth. I don't know if that answers your question. But I just wanted to, I don't know if that was obvious before.

start time: 612:55:10.000
end time: 643:18:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yes, thank you. Because I think that part kind of needs a little expanding because I think that it's not clear when you just look at this document. I mean, I know a little bit from discussions with both of you about this, but. Yeah, absolutely. So, like, you know, like, I, I, I, I, you know, Director Green, I want to appreciate you all the time because, you know, bringing the, the issue. But you know, we, we hired Dr. Armstrong because this is also, you know, the, the, the issue that you're describing is something that's corn to her as well. So I guess I'm going to back up a little bit because I think the COVID shot is starting to get in my head, starting to get a little fuzzy. What are, I guess I was looking for a little bit more specific. Like for example, when you mentioned authentic inclusive leadership. Right. On the second core competency. Right. Like, what would that, what would the data collecting for that kind of look like, if that makes sense. But you know, like for Oops. Because I know, like, for example, like we mentioned before, there's a lot of, like a lot of established work that has been done in say, like, for example, like climate surveys, right. Done with focus groups so that it's, it's done, you know, not just randomly, but actually scientific, social science, scientifically, which we always call soft science. And so that it is something that is reliable and repeatable or at least, you know, plus or minus a few percentage points. So, yeah, I'm just, I'm just curious about like if you already have some idea for some of these, like which ones and how would you collect that data?

start time: 643:27:50.000
end time: 653:34:42.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So. Yeah, that's a great question. So we wanted to list out the goals and make sure that we represented the board goals, but we didn't go into like what that would look like because we figured that would be something that the board would want to craft and design. We can certainly go back and make some recommendations. But you know, at the end of the day, you know, I also would want, I know that you all would need to know, like what are our work plans and how is the work being focused and elevated to then determine now how do we quantify or you know, qualify that?

start time: 653:37:46.000
end time: 694:56:00.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Let me get, I guess what I'm looking for in priorities two, I already talked about priority one, but two, three and four, the goals are very high level and somewhat generic. And so I would expect in that middle column, not we're going to throw in evidence, like along the way that works. But what at the start of the year, what at the end of the year would we expect to have seen in terms of developing a diverse, high quality, thriving workforce? What evidence would be presented to show that? Because I guess I'm. And this is, and I love that you're into sports analogy because I never liked participation in trophies either. But I think that's sort of what activities, just doing activities or measuring activities is sort of a participation trophy. And so it's like, what do we expect to see? But in order to do that, I think we have to understand the beginning of the year, what that is versus at the end of the year. Like, oh, here's, here's something that changed. Like picking out one piece of evidence that may prove a point, but it's not actually what we wanted. So I would expect on all these, we'd have something really specific. And I'll just say on number four, I think it's somewhat mushy in the sense of, like, community engagement. To do what? So that our students and families feel more included and welcome and understand, you know, how their students are doing. But like, for what point that we have community engagement so that we pass a bond. I want to be much more specific about the purpose of it. And I think there's some things from the climate survey we could use. We've got lots of data. Data. But to me, frankly, it just would be so subjective. You could come up with seven different board members and superintendent with seven different ideas about, you know, whether it knocked it out of the park or like, I don't see any evidence that that changed. So I'd really want those to be more clear in fairness. And I guess then I take them out.

end time: 714:06:34.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Well, we believe what. So we believe what Director Brim Edwards is saying. I think, as I said earlier though, that we wanted you all to put the numbers that you all felt like what your expectation is of me when it comes to some of these areas that are listed here. I mean, I could come up with my own expectations, but I thought that maybe that was the space for you all to then weigh in and put your percentages and numbers and whether it's, you know, retention, whether it's, you know, looking at our evaluation process and how many teachers or administrators move from, you know, plans of improvement to back to performing. I mean, there's lots of data in the system that's collected that speaks to how well we're doing with diverse, high quality workforce and some of these others. There's lots of work that's Going on with special education community schools model. And so but I, you know, I.

start time: 714:06:42.000
end time: 719:21:46.000
confidence: 0.88
G: Think this is what I'm going to clear. So you kind of want to get move away from more of subjective stuff to more concrete. Hey, if we have you know, 100 black teachers right now and we move to 150 type of evaluation versus a lot of this objective stuff.

start time: 719:22:18.000
end time: 731:16:50.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Well that's why we left priority. One board goes, we just said third grade reading. We didn't put a percentage because we figured that is already there. The board for. Yeah, you know, should there be a number or some data set that you want to examine that list that sits within a priority. Our focus was making sure that we represented two things, the strategic plan and the board goals. And also if you look at dispositions, as Chair Wong has said, the competencies and dispositions that was listed from the community, the engagement process for the search.

start time: 731:27:50.000
end time: 750:44:52.000
confidence: 0.95
G: So I just want to make sure I'm clear again. So I, I love that, I love the fact that if you were looking at the board goals we should, I mean the evaluation piece, we should have goals for her or set goals for her. So then there it's easy to quantify what she did. So and I, I like that. I think for some of these things it's really subjective. So either we take out a lot of subjective stuff or we come up with targets for her to hit. So that way it's just clear, you know. And of course, you know, always, you know, we look at results and go back to Director Wong's analogy. If you get a C. But if you're showing your work right then you can show as far as math you get to see but you're showing your work is the teacher can come back and say oh you know what, you forgot to divide here or you forgot the times here. It's kind of the same analogy. So I would love to like try to take out a lot of the subjective stuff and then come up with quantitative goals or stuff we set for her and then let that be that.

start time: 750:47:56.000
end time: 771:24:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Well and all of them actually quantitative pages. I mean that that was the way that they were set to not be subjective but for you to add in for instance the priority four, community engagement. That's definitely a first year priority. Right. Schedule and attend listening sessions with community leaders, parents and stakeholders. Should there be a number? I think we talked about and as you all know, as I presented in the board meeting, that goal number one is building trust and relationships. Right. And I know that it's more than attending, but I would think that you all would have an expectation that I'm out in community, that I'm in spaces that I'm meeting with people. My question is, what is that expectation? If you were to quantify it, would you want to see at the end of the year that I've attended 50 different things, 60, 200. And so I think that was the hope and the desire design and all this. Now we could have, you know, if there's something completely different, you know that that's definitely for you all to say. But that's just the thought process that went behind this and that communicates to me like it's really clear on what the expectation is of the board for me in this first year.

end time: 795:06:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I'm really curious. Thank you for that. I'm really curious what we already have data sets for. So that climate survey, one of the things we heard before you came on was our former superintendent didn't get out in the community very often. We didn't have like you should do 15 meetings a year because that's just measuring. It's just a count of meetings. But for this particular, for the community engagement, we could measure. There is a question on the claimant survey about generally it's like a customer satisfaction question on the survey. And we could look at that data point. Does that go up or down? Is there a more positive rating of the school district as a result? Because we could both count community engagements that you are proactive about or that your availability to rise to the moment, in the moment if there's an incident or something. And we could also look at that data point in the climate survey that gives us number a percentage rating that goes up or down or stays flat. I don't know if we could use both. And Director Hollins, I agree with you that we should have. We should quantify as much as we can. And we should also, I think look at where we already have the data. Dr. Adams, you might have a better idea. But where do we. Are there some of these areas.

end time: 804:05:20.000
confidence: 0.90
D: I'll just say I'm going to follow just on the community engagement though, just one point. I mean, I feel strong, strongly that like one of the outcomes of the community engagement should be we pass a bond dismay.

confidence: 0.95
D: Board thing outside, it's not a board thing. The type of bond that we pass and what our community thinks about the district will make a difference about whether we can gain support for it, whether we can raise money. She can certainly set, set the community setting in a positive way. All of these things actually are not just the superintendent's responsibility. It's just clear. But to me that's like if the superintendent goes and does 50 school visits and we have a bond package that gets referred that the community doesn't because of, you know, cost overruns in something or they don't feel an engagement with the central office or the way their schools are staffed or what, whatever, if there's not a good feeling that impacts how we can, whether we could pass the bond or not.

start time: 824:13:38.000
end time: 828:01:14.000
confidence: 0.96
G: But then how do you, but how do you, like for instance, if people don't want to pass because they don't want their property values to go up, you know, and you know, those other variables are, you know, inflation is up and so I can't afford, you know, more taxes. So I hear what you're saying, but.

start time: 828:01:22.000
end time: 836:17:42.000
confidence: 0.94
D: I just, it's a non subjective data point and to me I think it's great to go visit schools but you can have a superintendent who is not actually improving the environment of the broader community that visits all the schools. And so to me it's, that's not, it's not necessary. I don't like the visited certain number of schools because I don't, it's like for what purpose and what's the outcome that we're hoping for from those visits?

start time: 836:18:46.000
end time: 840:08:16.000
confidence: 0.94
G: So I guess on the question is how do you quantify if it doesn't pass? How do you, how do you, how do, how do you validate that as far as the superintendent responsibility, if it doesn't pass? Like what matrix are you using to say well it didn't pass?

confidence: 0.94
D: Well, I think the same one that you outlined of like walking through and as Director Wong said, like, you know, showing the work, like hey, from a staff level, we set this up, we demonstrated, we showed how we spent the 2020 bond funds. We've, you know, done X, Y and Z from a staff level. I mean there's lots of things that staff does to set, set things up. But for me, some of these other ones, you know, we could, we, we've had, we've had beloved superintendents who haven't accomplished a lot of things related to student outcomes or move the dial on some specific district initiatives. So that's, but I'm Looking forward. I'm sure you're going to be beloved and effective, but just beloved is not going to help our students.

B: So maybe one of the most important pieces of this is section four board of directors feedback, and it's asking for the superintendents to please share feedback for the board of directors on their work with you this year. What is the board of directors doing well in the support of your work? How could the board directors support your work more effectively and to what extent the board of directors tailored their management approach to your leadership philosophy and background? I think it's important.

start time: 863:59:38.000

A: Can you just finish up, like, about 10 seconds? Because I really kind of need to move on. We're kind of talking in circles now. That's one point. And it's fine. It's a good point. I think you should submit it. But I think we as a board need to come up with a method of agreeing. So one thing I'm going to propose. Everyone kind of do homework all these points on here. I don't know. Tell me if you're okay with this or not, but because of meeting laws, you can't email me. So I was hoping maybe I could volunteer Roseanne. If everyone can email Roseanne a version of this template with your score on each item about how important it is to you and how. Or maybe you want to take it off. So, like, maybe a scale from 0 to 5. 5 being like, this is of utmost importance. I'm keeping this in here. Zero being like, I want to see this erased. And if you want to add stuff, you're welcome to add it to the. Add it as well. And then we'll. If there's a lot of things added, we'll have to figure out how to get that out to the board and talk about it. Maybe we have to do it in a meeting, but if everyone can just send their ratings for each item to Roseanne. How does that sound?

start time: 890:50:30.000
end time: 897:02:30.000
confidence: 0.97
A: I think that's. So the issue we're dealing with right now is that the point of this draft is to figure out what is a priority for this board. Like, what are the goals that we want to measure? And then once the board decides, once we decide which ones are the most important to us, then that's when the conversation about how we're going to collect the data and what we're going to measure comes in.

start time: 897:03:10.000
end time: 898:55:18.000
confidence: 0.95
D: So is it really just the left column that you want us to focus on because. Okay, because once we figure out what's in the left column, let me just ask.

start time: 898:56:14.000
end time: 900:17:26.000
confidence: 0.97

start time: 900:19:58.000
end time: 903:41:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: So then the other question I have is I'll just say we have four priorities and then all these competencies. Do you want us to rank the competencies and which ones we'd want to keep as well?

start time: 903:42:00.000
end time: 911:44:42.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Yes, all of them. Every single line. Obviously, if you don't want any of the competencies, you can summarize. But I think the whole point is like I want to get feedback so that we have some kind of thing that we can work off of so that next time we can start narrowing down or expanding which goals that we really want to prioritize. And that way we can move to the next step, which is figuring out how do we collect this data, how do we collect this feedback.

E: May I ask a clarifying question? Most of the conversation tonight has been on the goal section and the comp. That's where the conversation has been focused. The competency section are the criteria the community said they wanted to see in the superintendent. So I would, if I may, I would urge the board to try to keep those because it's what community said they wanted to see. And I wonder if the conversation and further discussion and deliberation is about the goal areas I'm hearing and we all agree that student achievement is a prominent measure and the measure we know we have because I have to sit here and tell you all the news all the time. We don't have enough of our students on grade level and we're not going to be satisfied until those bars are at 100%. We've got to figure out how to get there. And so I wonder, for example, the board could decide, well, we want each of the goals to be one of the board goals. That could be something you all could talk about if these other things feel not concrete enough because then you still have the competencies and, and these other priority areas that are aligned to the strategic plan can be discussed as a part of the self reflection of the superintendent and the conversations about how we're trying to get to the board goals. So I just wanted to offer that.

start time: 936:21:50.000

G: And I'll just ask, so when we talk about the competencies, how do we quantify that? How do I judge authentic and inclusive of leadership? How do I judge transparent, ethical and courageous leadership? How do I quantify that?

end time: 960:20:30.000
confidence: 0.95
E: It would be based on hopefully evidence that the superintendent, Dr. Armstrong will provide as she has tried to demonstrate that competency. One, one of the things that isn't in this template are the descriptions of the competencies. I was trying to sort of not give you three point size font to make everything fit, but there are a little bit of more description in the superintendency search criteria. And I do think in my experience, evaluation does come down often to judgment. Right. We teachers make judgments about student progress. Principals make judgment about teacher progress in standing. Leaders make judgment about their staff's progress in standing. And it's usually some combination of a goal that you set or a couple goals that you set and competencies that you've demonstrated throughout the course of the school year.

A: Yeah, I agree. Thank you. Just for the sake of time, if there's further questions, you can send them to me. Roseanne. Well, sorry. Yes, send it to Roseanne. The commentary on the draft evaluation. Send it to Roseanne. We have one last item is just five minutes for Eddie.

end time: 1005:44:14.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Okay. Because I have two things. Sorry. Well, this is the first time we've had a public discussion. So I would like to ask on the board of directors feedback, just like I think the fair thing for the board to do is to tell the superintendent here's, here's what we expect when we evaluate. I would like to understand from the superintendent like at the beginning of the year how she would answer that question, like, what would the support, what would the board supporting your work look like? So if we get to the end of the year and the question, and the question is like how the board did. Just like I think it's fair for us to say to the superintendent, like here's what our expectations, like, we think this is what success looks like. I would like to know from the superintendent what success looks like versus at the end of the year, you know, as Eddie, as a teacher, excuse me, Director Wong, like finding out the end of the classroom, like he didn't understand what success looked like. So that's one thing. And then I don't know if people saw in their email, but Liz sent the provision in the contract that has the when we have to inform the superintendent when they do their self evaluation and then the date, then we're going to perform an evaluation. And I think the next board discussion we need to have that timeline set out. So that we're following the contract again, in fairness to the superintendent. And the last thing is there was a mention that the quarterly meetings would just be with board leadership. And again, I feel like it should be with the full board as sort of best practice to have those, you know, not an evaluation conversation. But how are things going again? Hey, you guys, you're not looking like this isn't feeling very supportive or this next quarter. Here's what I'm going to need in terms of support from the board on X, Y and Z. But I think those are conversations that should happen with the full board and just be part of. There was a great. I think. Andrew, I need to go.

end time: 1024:21:12.000
confidence: 0.97
I: This is super quick. So I sent you the information about the self evaluation, and I just wanted to know, would you rather have the discussion on February 11 or February 18? 18th is a scheduled work session, so we might have something else going on the 11th. There's no meeting scheduled, and the person who would be doing the work with us said that you can do it either way. It has to be a public meeting. And the only thing with doing it when there's already a scheduled work session, it might already be full. And she said it usually takes an hour and a half to two hours to go through the discussions again, going ahead and doing it February 11th. So February 11th would mean that would be. That would all we be doing that day. So. Okay.

And I say we just schedule for the 18th, and if it can't work on the 18th, then we'll ask everyone to schedule an 11th. Does that sound okay to everyone?

confidence: 0.95
D: So I'd like to finish my comment since I was interrupted and you just moved on the agenda item that at the end of the evaluation that we had last year, there was sort of a cadence and A timeline. And again, I think, in fairness to the superintendent, we need to have that outlined. It's already the end of September, and I don't think we should have another meeting where we're talking about the evaluation again without looking at that timeline and when our quarterly. And get the quarterly meetings on the calendar. Again, this is in fairness to the superintendent versus versus just letting it slide, which has happened in the past.

end time: 1065:46:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: It was really using the board goals. I thought. I thought it was using the board goals as that. We are evaluating on those.

F: Right.

start time: 1065:58:54.000
end time: 1067:48:06.000
confidence: 0.92
D: And then the competencies. But we'd be getting rid of priority 2, 3, and 4. That's what I heard.

end time: 1068:18:50.000

start time: 1068:50:46.000
end time: 1068:57:42.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Right.

start time: 1068:59:26.000
end time: 1069:08:38.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So.

start time: 1069:10:54.000
end time: 1070:12:38.000
confidence: 0.85
C: Or goal one would be priority one, or goal two would be priority two.

start time: 1070:13:34.000
end time: 1070:24:10.000
confidence: 0.98
F: Yes.

start time: 1070:33:50.000
end time: 1076:37:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Right. But it would be. Essentially, I'm just trying to understand the assignment. So at first it was rank the four priorities, whether we want to keep them or not, and then Dr. Adams recommended actually doing the board goals as the four priorities and keeping the competencies as well. Is that what we're choosing between?

start time: 1077:06:00.000
end time: 1087:40:16.000
confidence: 0.94
A: No, no. I think I'm going to say all the above, because I think if there's enough board members that want to move to that option, just doing the board goals is priority 1, 2, 3, then we'll move to that. But if the majority of board members are in favor of keeping this and maybe waiting some and getting rid of some, then we'll do it that way. So I think whatever you want. Sounds right. You can do both. You can have. I want this. You know, the. The board goals would be prior to 1, 2, 3, 4, as like my top. But then my second would be like, these are the ones I want. You can. I would say, send it to Roseanne, and then we'll have to figure out some way to tabulate.

start time: 1087:42:08.000
end time: 1099:11:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So I'm wondering. I know that we're already extended on time, but it sounded like just listening, that the board has more of an appetite for board goals and things that they can directly measure because the other one will need to be workshopped. And find new measurements and other ways to. So I'm just wondering if there's enough here that can lean into Dr. Adams recommendation and make a decision on that, or if you feel like you still want. Because if that's the case, then people can give feedback on that, which is the recommendation is really take the four priorities, make them the board goals, keep the rest, and then give feedback on that.

start time: 1099:24:30.000
end time: 1103:29:30.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I'm gonna go with Dr. Adams. I'm just throwing that out there. That's gonna be my vote. That's what I'm sending in. Because I don't care if everybody likes you or don't like you. If the kids can't read and everybody likes you, then it's irrelevant anyway. So I'm gonna go with the one that Dr. Adams suggested.

start time: 1103:36:30.000
end time: 1103:51:18.000
confidence: 0.99
D: I like that, too.

start time: 1103:52:14.000
end time: 1104:54:34.000
confidence: 0.97
A: At the same time, we're still keeping the core competencies. Is that what the suggestion was?

start time: 1104:55:42.000
end time: 1105:02:58.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Yes.

start time: 1105:04:34.000
end time: 1106:15:10.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Okay. So my question would be, which one would be more useful to you?

start time: 1106:33:30.000
end time: 1110:33:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I think the board goals will be useful, and we still need to have another conversation about those as well and making sure that we're looking at how things are trending and setting high but realistic expectations.

start time: 1111:01:30.000
end time: 1125:51:02.000
confidence: 0.95
F: And I also. I'm not very. Because I'm not an educator, I'm not really gonna be the best to set a number on what it would be, because in my mind, it's going to be match it immediately. But I know that's not even close to realistic. So I would actually prefer to get some guidance because I also wanted to note that the last numbers that were set, we didn't set. The superintendent set those. So the board did not establish those numbers. We didn't say that this is what we thought the percentage was going to be or that it should be. The board did not do that. The superintendent said the sitting superintendent set those numbers and the board adopted them and agreed to them. And so I'm not. I'm not good at setting the numbers. I just want to hold people accountable to what. What we feel like we should be doing.

start time: 1125:54:06.000

start time: 1126:16:38.000
end time: 1132:22:26.000
confidence: 0.94
C: That's great. And I just want to add that we probably will sprinkle in some things I those board goals. So if we're looking at third grade reading, not just necessarily just a finite number, but like, you know, other items too, that look at things we're moving as it relates to literacy for third graders, too. So. But we'll have.

confidence: 0.94
F: That's why we have you, because you already know the stuff that I'm trying to get to, and it's I know that it's. It's something that is extreme, extremely important to you. So I don't feel like I'm. I'm too far out aligned with any of the stuff that I've said. I feel like it's preaching to the choir, but even the choir needs rehearsal, so I'm just putting it out there for all of us.

start time: 1163:09:18.000
end time: 1170:17:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Oh, okay. So my recommendation, based on the board's discussion, is to remove current. In the draft, the current priorities two through four, to place each of the board goals singularly as a goal area in the goal section, and to keep the competencies for the superintendent search based on the community feedback that went into the selection of Dr. Armstrong.

start time: 1170:34:50.000
end time: 1176:19:50.000
confidence: 0.93
G: I agree with that. I just. I will add to. I would want to know once again how we measure those other competencies. You know, that the community. Because community is not going to be the ones that's doing the evaluation. So as a board member for myself, I would want to know how to measure those other competencies. Unless we're just saying they're just going to be, you know, specifically.

start time: 1177:31:00.000
end time: 1178:51:24.000
confidence: 0.83
A: I mean, some. Some of you can. Yeah, yeah. There's ways. Perfect.

start time: 1178:52:12.000
end time: 1185:28:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: But there's ways so that I haven't clicked on the link that says criteria, but I think we could. I could. I mean, I haven't looked at it, but I think that there will be some things in there that will be measurable. And I think it's important to show the community that, you know, this is what we heard. This is how we made a decision higher and this is what we'll be evaluating on. I don't know what that looks like yet.

start time: 1185:37:30.000
end time: 1188:44:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I mean, some of the core competencies are repetitive too. Of priorities, 2, 3, 4. So it probably includes it already. So I'm okay with it, too. Moving to.

start time: 1188:46:50.000
end time: 1190:18:30.000

B: So when I'm looking at that next superintendent criteria, there's bullet points under each one of the experience strategic and visionary educational leadership. And there's three bullet points under there. I'm looking at the next superintendent criteria. It doesn't have a date on it, but it's linked in the evaluation. And so a demonstrated ability to articulate and act upon a future focused strategic vision that prepares each PPS graduate for post secondary pathway. And we could evaluate that based on whether that's been delivered upon. I guess that's like a yes, no question.
