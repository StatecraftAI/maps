confidence: 0.98
F: I think I might, though. But I'll. I'll remember that. I'll remember that. Chair. Vice Chair Green. So let's jump into. Let's jump into the work. One of the most. Most important things I think that we do is at the early stage of a process, commit to a time frame. And so our goal would be tonight, with our first agenda item, to commit to a timeline. Now, the draft that you see did not take into account your personal schedules because we didn't have them when we built them. So we built a draft that would work, and I'd like to walk through it. And there are moments in time when we need. There are a handful of moments in time when we need all board members to be present. So when we get to those, I would like to see if that date will work and hopefully it will. If it won't, then we need to. We need to punt and we'll take a few moments to figure out what will work instead. Of course, there are things on the timeline that are important for you to know, but don't necessitate your. Your being present somewhere. So, for instance, if you look at the timeline, I'll give folks a moment if they don't already have it. We are already up into the third row. I can't see the board closely enough to see if anybody needs more time. So let me know if you need more time. Otherwise, let's jump into this. This document.

confidence: 0.93
C: Yeah, no, I'm not doing that at all. I don't. My admin isn't here, Ashley, and I'm not going to lock myself into dates at all. So, Roseanne, you'll probably have to connect with. But, Ashley, I think these are broader.

end time: 92:50:56.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Well, let me. Let me answer. Let me. Let me answer the question because we're not prepared to do that. We're not prepared to do that. The intent of tonight was to look at this agenda and on the. There are certain events that need a commitment from the board to be present. And it was our intention tonight to ask you if those dates would work on your schedule and to have you have a few moments to look through your calendars and so forth. If that's not something that we can do tonight, then we're going to have to find another time to do that. But it's everybody.

start time: 92:51:28.000
end time: 95:13:40.000
confidence: 0.92
C: It's just me. I can't. I'm not speaking for everybody. I'm only speaking for. For me, for. For Herman Green.

start time: 97:14:10.000
end time: 99:21:10.000
confidence: 0.98
F: Well, let's get started. Let's walk through them. But. But if it's only Director Green, if it's only yourself, Maybe we can figure out a way to.

start time: 99:39:30.000
end time: 102:14:02.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I know we will. I know we will. There's. I have every doubt that we will come up with something. Hey, trust you me, I know we will. I got every confidence in you.

start time: 102:17:06.000
end time: 108:01:10.000
confidence: 0.97
F: I like your confidence. Thank you, sir. Let's go. Let's go through this and see. And see how far we can get. We are in the third. I'm going to assume everybody's got it, so I'm going to jump into the third row, which is where we are right now. The planning meeting. Number two board one on ones I believe have already been scheduled and completed. I think with all board members.

start time: 108:08:50.000
end time: 108:26:02.000
confidence: 0.96
J: Have one left.

start time: 108:27:46.000
end time: 152:26:48.000
confidence: 0.97
F: One left. Thank you. Thank you, Christie. And the next row is focus groups. This is a body of work that we talked about the last meeting, which also does not specifically need board member time at any specific moment. So that's. That's maybe in the FYI category, but that work is already being scheduled and planned and being executed upon. It's a. It's a heavy lift. I want to thank my team and I want to thank your team as well, particularly Roseanne and Liz as well as the work group of board members who participated on that. The next row is. You'll see I'm moving fast because we've. We've talked a little bit about the overview in the last week and I want to move toward when might the board need to be present. We'll have some discussions that this next row agreement slash planning around second round interview process is something that Christy will talk about a little bit later in the agenda. But there's no specific dates associated with that at this moment. Our goal board is to open the vacancy window March 15, which is merely 11 days from now. We feel ready to do that. If we can hit all those things above. We're confident we can do that. Board. And that means. And so a vacancy window, which may or may not be a term that you're all familiar with is that's when the applicants can apply and that's when your consultant team moves fully into recruitment. We're out there talking to folks. We see that. And so that's in blue. You'll see that begins March 15th on our draft schedule. It begins March 15th, then ends on April 19th, a little bit over a month for the recruitment period. As you remember, we talked about at last meetings, because of where we are in the season, we are going to. We are going to do some degree of overlap between the recruitment window and the engagement period. So the engagement period hasn't ended on March 15th. It's still ongoing. We have a survey that will be going out. Christy will talk a little bit about that later in tonight's agenda. And then we get to. We get to the next row, which does require a moment in time that the board would review. It's really the next two rows. If you think about the board would review the next superintendent criteria that we've drafted and that there would be a meeting on April 9. That would be a great day if we're able to do that. To have a meeting where there's an adoption of the next superintendent criteria. I do not believe. Correct me if I'm wrong. I do not believe there's currently meeting scheduled. I don't think there's a board meeting scheduled on April 9th. So that. Am I right, Roseanne?

start time: 152:29:44.000
end time: 154:09:00.000
confidence: 0.86
H: Correct. There's no meeting scheduled.

start time: 154:20:00.000
end time: 157:39:40.000
confidence: 0.98
F: So that would be. And I don't know if we're prepared to. To do that tonight, but nothing would make me happier if we could commit to a special meeting on April 9 to adopt this next superintendent criteria.

start time: 157:52:10.000
end time: 158:32:18.000
confidence: 1.00

confidence: 0.97
F: I beg your pardon. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Just making sure you're paying attention. That will allow us to close the vacancy window on April 19. And that gives 10 days for candidates who or prospects, folks who may or may not be applying to zero in on. Okay. What is the PPS board asking of me? What are they expecting? And that's a good amount of time for candidates to Say, okay, this is me, I want to get my application in. Or you know what, I've. I've seen what they're asking and I'm not really the right match for them. I'm pulling out. So that's perfect. So that allows us to close the window on the 19th. I want to go backward now for a moment. What we'll do, and as Christy suggested earlier, is we. We actually would like to have two readings. We'd like to have an initial reading where you, you see the criteria. You might respond to it prior to the ninth. And that can be. That doesn't need to be a special meeting. I don't know if you have something scheduled between April 2nd and 9th, but I. If we could either get something on the agenda between April 2nd and 9th or have a short special meeting.

start time: 245:27:10.000
end time: 247:45:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Let me check. So we have the second as a whole. We don't have a regular board meeting. So we have one, don't we?

start time: 254:16:48.000
end time: 255:30:20.000
confidence: 0.90
I: I was gonna say do it as part of the board meeting. I guess if people wanna do it at five, that's fine. Cause it's held on our calendar.

start time: 255:36:00.000
end time: 256:07:36.000
confidence: 0.98
H: Unless they need more than an hour.

start time: 256:10:08.000
end time: 262:31:06.000
confidence: 0.97
I: So. Hank, can I ask a question? I mean we just scheduled an hour and a half vote. Now we're talking about an hour on this to review these criteria. In my mind, this shouldn't be a conversation that lasts more than about 10 minutes. And I guess I'm thinking that we will's board members will have seen this beforehand. I guess if someone's got issues, we can raise them. It feels like a lot of time us to be spending.

start time: 262:32:58.000
end time: 264:39:10.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Seems like we should have the most time for the meeting be when we review it and then when we get to the vote, that should be 10 minutes.

start time: 265:39:30.000
end time: 272:35:04.000
confidence: 0.98
F: I will say in my experience that doesn't often happen. But if the board's making a commitment to do that, I would agree that that certainly could be. And I would agree that the first meeting is maybe where you're going to offer more of your. Of your thoughts. But also keep in mind that the 9th is the date when you're going to hear public testimony. And so it's important that you hear that testimony and that you take that into account before your vote.

start time: 272:37:12.000
end time: 280:45:40.000
confidence: 0.97
I: We generally limit public testimony to five. So unless. Unless we're going to open it up and do something broader than that, I guess I would say is if we're really relying on public testimony for this, we wouldn't want to do it on the 9th because that's when we're voting. We'd want to do that as earlier. I guess I'm just flagging this. I guess I'm hoping that we do. I mean, as individuals, we get this beforehand. We can have some conversations with you if we have any issues. So that our public meetings are more of just the pro forma. I mean, I'm assuming we're going to be all in agreement, and if we're not, we can work some of that out.

start time: 281:02:40.000
end time: 281:32:08.000
confidence: 0.97
C: That we can work it out before we get.

start time: 281:33:04.000
end time: 282:53:40.000
confidence: 0.97
I: I guess the other thing I'll say is the more if we schedule the time, we're going to take it. I know my colleagues, so.

start time: 283:54:40.000
end time: 285:06:50.000
confidence: 0.91
A: I think, yeah, what you're getting at is being more efficient with the sequencing of this. And.

start time: 285:07:30.000
end time: 285:41:14.000
confidence: 0.98
I: And also, we are way deep in the weeds.

start time: 285:43:22.000
end time: 285:56:42.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Way deep.

start time: 285:59:06.000
end time: 288:18:18.000
confidence: 0.92
H: So one thing, when we review for the April 2nd through 9th board reviews, will we have already seen a list?

start time: 288:20:34.000
end time: 299:17:40.000
confidence: 0.98
F: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, ideally, it sounds like you are operating on sort of the top level of boardsmanship. I mean, ideally, what we would like is that you've certainly, you've seen it and you've read it, and if we could come on April 2nd with whatever thoughts you have, that would be great. And if you want to insert public testimony at that point, too, I think that. I think that would be wise. We could, in fact, then have a much shorter meeting on the 9th. But it is important that the public has access. I mean, it is statutorily important that the. That the public has access to it and can give commentary to it. So that's why usually that happens at the second meeting.

start time: 299:38:30.000
end time: 302:00:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So we're going to do that. If we are going to do that. I think I'm with Director Scott. I think we just do it during the board meeting if we're going to be having public comments.

start time: 302:37:10.000
end time: 327:53:00.000
confidence: 0.95
D: The one thing that I would say, in addition to the issues that Hank just raised, is at a certain point, then the recruiting team is off. Once we've approved it, they're often recruiting. And the next time people are really going to see, like who might be in the job is when you have the people who might be in the job. And so one of the most important. I mean, I always felt the important, like, people felt like I had a say in, like, who got selected was helping, you know, giving their input into the position description. Because it was like, hey, we went and recruited, you know, this pool of candidates that meet this criteria. And so while it seems like it's just a job description, it's also a really important proof point because when you hire. When you hire that superintendent, there's going to be people who, like, disagree. And it's like, this is the candidate that came closest to that position description that we all talked about. That said, this is what that we're trying to recruit. So to me, it's more than just a position description. It's also sort of your pact with the community. Like, we're going to go try and find the people who meet this position description. So just merits some, like, public discussion. Like, here are the five main competencies or criteria. So as long as we have time for that.

start time: 328:45:10.000
end time: 336:29:28.000
confidence: 0.98
I: I would agree with director. I think that's the most important part. So I think if we want to set aside even that extra hour, Gary's over here talking to Roseanne. But Even if that 5:00, which we already have held in our calendar on the second, do that, as you know, we publish the criteria, maybe we open up for more testimony than our normal five, give people an opportunity. I guess what I'm getting is I feel like as board members, we should come prepared with. Yeah, I'm fine with the criteria. Or here are my suggested changes. We can even give that to you ahead of time.

start time: 336:30:24.000
end time: 336:53:12.000
confidence: 0.83
F: That's what I would say.

start time: 336:54:56.000
end time: 337:31:04.000
confidence: 0.99
I: Let's spend the time hearing from the public on the second.

start time: 337:32:32.000
end time: 337:38:32.000
confidence: 0.83
A: Yes.

start time: 337:39:36.000
end time: 338:32:24.000
confidence: 0.92
I: Then we can incorporate anything during that week and then take a vote on.

start time: 338:32:32.000
end time: 345:45:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: The 9th, which that's what I was thinking. If we can. If we can. If we have questions about the criteria. I don't want to bring that up at the meeting. Let's look at this up and get that in ahead of time so that by the time we get to the meeting, we've already. We've already gone through our questions and the changes have been made. So now we can spend more time allowing the public or the community to. To weigh in on now, what they've heard or something like that. I'd much rather do it that way.

start time: 345:56:50.000
end time: 347:46:50.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So what I'm hearing is we want to do the bigger meeting on the earlier one and then the shorter vote one on the ninth.

start time: 347:48:10.000
end time: 348:17:30.000
confidence: 0.98
I: Yeah. And maybe Use that five o'clock.

start time: 348:18:50.000
end time: 350:53:46.000
confidence: 0.88
B: Yeah. So we can just say. So we're going to have. We'll set that 5 o'clock time just to hear public comments for the superintendent search and we'll post it that way.

start time: 350:54:58.000
end time: 350:59:54.000
confidence: 0.45
H: Yeah.

start time: 351:00:42.000
end time: 353:40:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So we have a whole hour to hear that stuff and then we can get into our. Without voting. So then we can get into our meeting at 6 and they.

start time: 353:41:30.000
end time: 355:11:30.000
confidence: 0.92
H: And the public will have filled out the surveys by then, right? You will, you will have.

start time: 355:12:10.000
end time: 355:22:30.000
confidence: 0.68
F: Yes.

start time: 355:32:10.000
end time: 357:24:30.000
confidence: 0.99
H: Then you'll have a result of what those surveys showed, and that will be presented at that meeting as well.

start time: 357:38:50.000
end time: 360:05:34.000
confidence: 0.97
F: The surveys inform the creation of that document. So that's what you see. You see the document which is created through the focus groups and through the survey responses.

start time: 360:07:42.000
end time: 362:55:42.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Can I ask for clarification? So the 5 o'clock time will be like a preview of the criteria with public comment on the second.

start time: 362:57:26.000
end time: 363:02:54.000
confidence: 0.53
B: Yeah.

start time: 363:03:42.000
end time: 364:47:10.000
confidence: 0.87
D: So on this, a week later, you will vote on the criteria with additional public comment.

start time: 364:49:10.000
end time: 369:32:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah. So yeah, on a second, we're going to do a board review for the superintendent criteria on the 2nd with public comment. And then on the 9th, we will adopt the criteria for the superintendent with public comment.

start time: 369:42:40.000
end time: 370:00:24.000
confidence: 0.84
H: With public comment.

start time: 370:01:52.000
end time: 373:11:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Because you have to have, you have to, anytime you vote, you have to have public comment. So. And we only. We have a couple, two, three slots for that. Okay.

start time: 374:00:10.000
end time: 387:18:36.000
confidence: 0.98
F: So board, as I think about the conversation you just had in the plan, I, I think that's a really wise one. And, and the piece that I want to make sure that we would do is we're going to get you the criteria draft ahead of time. You're going to reflect on it, public is going to come and provide testimony. We will still need to hear you say something at that meeting on the second to give us information about how you might want us to revise it. Right. And then we're going to bring it back to you on with whatever revision. So there, I want to be clear, it doesn't sound like it would be purely public testimony. There does need to be some board public thinking reflection so that we have our marching orders to come back with potentially a revised document one week later. Does that sound about right to you? Yeah.

start time: 387:19:08.000
end time: 389:32:10.000
confidence: 0.97
I: Hank, is there any reason why that can't be done individually with us ahead of time just to speed things up, or are you not anticipating having that criteria done before then?

start time: 389:51:50.000
end time: 395:09:18.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Well, the dilemma. There is. The dilemma is there, there is this. If we post a draft in public space and you are then giving us feedback. I'm, I'm thinking aloud here. But if you're giving us feedback. But the, but the public is the only artifact the public has to respond to. Is that an initial draft?

start time: 395:10:54.000
end time: 405:33:56.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Now I hear, let me like what I'm thinking is how we get to that initial draft. This will correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I am. You can share your early drafts with individual board members and individual board members can provide you feedback because those are internal advisory communications and we're simply providing feedback in order to get to the draft. Then you have something that, you know, each one of us, not collectively like, we're not talking to one another, we're individually saying, hey, this captures everything I thought or maybe I want these things. Okay, you got a draft that's maybe 80% there. That's what we publish, get comments on from the public. We have any conversation as a group on the second, hear from the public, make any revisions and adopt it.

start time: 405:35:08.000
end time: 410:20:00.000
confidence: 0.98
F: Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Director Scott, that, that, that that process of going into one on ones with board directors is, is not something that we have, you know, that that's not part of a process that we've established or that, that we have bandwidth around or that we've got time to come back and do individual. So it really does need to be in.

start time: 411:09:10.000
end time: 412:10:50.000
confidence: 0.99
G: I would also like to build in some time to talk with the other board members.

start time: 412:17:10.000
end time: 412:37:34.000
confidence: 0.87
I: We can do that in a second.

start time: 412:39:02.000
end time: 420:37:24.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I was going to say ask the second. On the second. If so if we have everything or close to it by the second, then on the second, as we're hearing public comment, that also gives us an opportunity to hear what the way I'm thinking, the rest of my team is thinking about it, maybe areas that they like or dislike or something like that, all that. But for the most part, I'm thinking that for the most part we're there.

start time: 420:38:52.000
end time: 420:43:00.000
confidence: 0.73
F: Right.

start time: 420:43:40.000
end time: 427:42:22.000
confidence: 0.95
C: You know, there may be a few kinks in the, in the armor that we need to tamper out, but for the most part we might be there and we're really spending a lot of time listening to what the public has to say about it because that'll be the one piece that we all haven't heard. And that is what does the. What does Joe Public or Susie Public think about. About what we're, what we're putting out. I want to hear a lot of that.

start time: 427:45:26.000
end time: 433:30:50.000
confidence: 0.93
D: There will definitely be different points of view because there'll be people like standard debates. There'll be like high levels of accountability. Tight, loose. I mean, there will be, I think, some significant disagreements within Our community over what we should emphasize and.

start time: 433:37:20.000
end time: 434:35:00.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Yeah, and we should listen to it. And we have to make the decision.

start time: 435:05:20.000
end time: 436:44:20.000
confidence: 0.96
G: The survey that you're doing, the raw data, is that going to be available to us as well?

start time: 437:22:40.000
end time: 439:53:00.000
confidence: 0.97
F: The survey data is typically not given to the board. Once we give it to the board, that becomes a public document. There's a. That's typically not something that we would advise.

start time: 440:25:20.000
end time: 440:49:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: We'll get the analysis.

start time: 440:57:10.000
end time: 441:30:38.000

start time: 452:04:50.000
end time: 475:54:46.000
confidence: 0.98
F: Yes, indeed, Indeed. Let's look past the 19th. So the 19th, the window closes. As you recall, when we went through this last time, the first. The. The first process is that the consultant team reviews and selects some number of candidates for preliminary interviews. And those candidates who get preliminary interviews also get preliminary reference calls on April 27th. This is not a date that I necessarily need every board member to commit to. This is the start date by which you would have access to the applications, and you would have, starting that day and for the ensuing days, the opportunity to review whatever number of applications you care to review. And that would bring us to the very next date that we'd like to be able to hopefully commit to. Tonight, which is your slate meeting. That's the meeting. It's an executive session where the board comes together. It's just the board and the consultant team. You've reviewed some number of applicants, some of you maybe more than others, and you're going to make a decision as to whom you want to invite for a first round interview. And so is it possible. We did great. On April 2, April 9, is it possible to look at May 1 and see if that. I think I already heard a. Was that a yes?

start time: 475:56:38.000
end time: 478:47:28.000
confidence: 0.93
B: We have a board budget hearing and budget workshop session on the first. Well, so the question is, do you guys want to add on to that. That type that meeting?

end time: 484:04:20.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I would say we. It doesn't give us enough time. I mean, the four days is kind of tight to review, depending. I don't know how many we're going to, how many applications will or candidates we'd be reviewing. But does that give us enough time to prepare for other readings?

start time: 485:06:20.000
end time: 486:11:32.000
confidence: 0.88
H: Well, it could be 10 candidates more if we want.

start time: 486:13:16.000
end time: 490:01:20.000
confidence: 0.96
D: That's a great question. Because would we actually, on the 27th, which is a Saturday, have it in the morning? Because if we've got. I mean, for me those are Saturday and Sunday would be the days I'd have.

F: Yeah. So I wasn't going to recommend May 2. Let's move to the next row. And then we're gonna come back. We're gonna come back to the slate meeting and let's talk about where the first round interview is. The first round interview board is the longest, the biggest chunk of time that you'll be committing in the search. We usually do one really robust, adrenaline filled, wonderful day. And we usually start at breakfast and we usually end at evening. Little dinner time. That's the kind of day we look at. And so we threw May 6th out there. Is that potentially a day that all seven board members could clear their schedules and participate in a day of first round interviews?

confidence: 0.98
F: Don'T even see if May 13th works. Let's do May 13th. It will push. I mean, it will push your announcement out into June, but it's super important that all board members are participating. So that's what we do. That's what we do. Is the 13th a day that appears to. To work? Not.

start time: 560:40:24.000
end time: 563:35:40.000
confidence: 0.97
I: I mean, not ideally. Can we take a step back with the board? We're talking. Hank's talking about one full day. What. How do people feel about breaking it into two evenings, starting from like. Like four to seven?

start time: 563:43:20.000
end time: 565:32:10.000
confidence: 0.98
F: That. That would be insufficient. Director Scott. This is. This is a good 10 hours of work, maybe even 11.

start time: 565:50:30.000
end time: 569:28:50.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Okay, well, some of us. May I then pick a day and I'll let you know if. If I can do it or if I'll just step back from the interviews. So, I mean, I'll do my best, but, you know, if we're not able to do them on the weekend, we're not able to do them in the evening.

start time: 569:39:50.000
end time: 571:06:50.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Can I ask Another question though. Are, are we doing these virtual with candidates? Are they in person?

start time: 571:11:50.000
end time: 574:49:52.000
confidence: 0.97
F: We, we are doing them virtual. They could be on consecutive evenings. I just don't, I just want to, I don't want to want people to think it's from 4 to 7 that would. You never get through them. You could do them on consecutive evenings from five to 10. But it is why we need 10 hours.

start time: 574:51:36.000
end time: 575:27:40.000
confidence: 0.90
I: But then we're interviewing people for five people.

start time: 575:40:40.000
end time: 577:53:04.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I was going to just follow up that with that same thing that we're interviewing them at 1 in the morning, potentially not at 7:00.

start time: 577:55:12.000
end time: 580:50:52.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Well, we interviewed folks at 1 in the morning. As I said, we usually start at breakfast and we usually end at evening. And it's a long, robust day. We don't interview at 1 in the morning.

start time: 580:52:36.000
end time: 586:49:16.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Can you, can you, Hank, can you walk through why we need 10 hours to interview five people? I mean, I want to be really clear. I want to be there. I want to do everything I can to be there. But you're asking for a massive chunk of time to interview five people. So I'm just. What's happening during that 10 hours? Like are the interviews, I mean, these are 45 minute interviews, hour long interviews, two hour interviews.

start time: 586:49:48.000
end time: 604:57:00.000
confidence: 0.97
F: What are we, what are we looking at? They are typically right around an hour, sometimes 50, 55 minutes, sometimes an hour somewhere right in there. There's usually, there's not. Usually there is a 30 minute or so 30 to 40 minute debrief time where you're reviewing each candidate on their own merits. Breaks are built into the day and we interview each candidate on their own merits after they interview. At the end of the day, we have a summative discussion where you've, where you reflect is the first time, the only time the day that you come together and say, okay, we've interviewed these five, and I say 50, 55, 60, because we don't know if it's five candidates, we don't know if it's six candidates. Sometimes people want. So within that range, let's say it's an hour interview. Let's say it's a 30, 35 minute debrief, which is not a lot of time for a seven member board. People need a lunch break. People need little stretch breaks. We have never had a board not do that. We, we certainly can adjust. If this board says they don't want to spend that amount of time, we can certainly adjust. This is how we've done every time. And with success, I'm just gonna say.

start time: 604:57:40.000
end time: 627:08:00.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I definitely do because I look at this as like we're gonna meet somebody twice that we're gonna hire to lead the district. And to me that seems like Nike would never hired somebody after two interviews. So I want. I would want to have a full opportunity to interview somebody, get a sense of. I mean, you know, maybe they say you have 10 questions, they screw up too, but like they knock the other A out of the park. If you give them much smaller amount of time, I think you get a more shallow look at the candidates. So for me, I'm not even super comfortable with just two interviews by the board. So I don't want to condense the time down. I also think I know the pool shrinks. So you actually want that first round to be larger than. Because there may be some people who exit themselves out and then if you didn't do somebody in the first round, it's hard to add them back in. I'm not wild about losing a workday, but I also think we need the time to meet the candidates that we're potentially going to bring to Portland.

F: 13Th. That is awesome. Thank you, board. And before we get to Director Green, I want to go back to Director Pass because I think we've solved your problem. Since with the first round interviews are now on May 13th, I think we have much more flexibility, the date of that. So the slate meeting. The first was not a good day. The second and third are not good days for us. Excuse me. This would be about a 90 minute executive session to determine first round candidates. Because this is a virtual interview, we're not looking at, you know, having people buy last minute plane tickets. There's none of that. And because we're committing to dates ahead of time, candidates will know well in advance that if they're invited for a first round interview, it will be on May 13th. But we want to give a little time to just build a schedule, get things taken care of. So I would say if we could have a slate meeting, which we can do virtually, if that works for folks who might be out of time, if we could do that May 6th or 7th or even 8th, that would be great.

And Vice Chair Green, I'm going to head off your disappointment because we can't possibly do them on the 21st. 22nd. 23rd, sir.

start time: 784:06:58.000
end time: 785:20:40.000

start time: 790:08:04.000
end time: 795:27:08.000
confidence: 0.98
F: No, I. Right. Which I think is probably the weekend of May 26th. 27th. Anyway, so we'd be looking now at somewhere between. Well, here's what I would like to propose. Is that the 20. The week of May 28th. I say 28th, which is a Tuesday, because I think Memorial day is the 27th.

start time: 795:28:44.000
end time: 795:42:04.000

B: Yep.

start time: 796:01:40.000
end time: 811:07:14.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Okay. So I'd like to propose that the week of 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st is when you're doing your final interviews in person. Now, the good news is you're not spending full day, full days like you did on the first round. You're spending a chunk of time. Typically what you'll do is you'll, you'll meet one candidate per evening or one candidate per afternoon. So we'd be looking for round about a three hour block of time. We don't have to decide that right this minute. I don't want to spend right now deciding exactly what time really. I just want to know is, can the board commit to those days being days where there will be interviews or where you will find some chunks of time? It'll. For instance, if somebody's traveling, that's not going to work. But if somebody, if people, if that's a pretty regular week and people can block out their evenings or their afternoons or something that I will call it.

D: Good for tonight, I'm going to be on Tuesday. On Tuesdays and Thursdays during the day I have commission meetings I have to go to and on Wednesday night I have something. I mean, it's just, it's just hard because it's right in the middle of budget season.

And so as soon after May 31st as is humanly possible, we should do that. So that could be the first, if that's possible. I. I don't know if somebody said they couldn't, or it could be the third, but we don't want to wait too long. Third of June. Sheila, why don't we look at June 3rd?

start time: 980:19:00.000
end time: 984:02:20.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Question just given that's all very condensed. So say we have two or three candidates that we're interviewing, I don't know, on the 28th 30th or 31st.

start time: 984:31:20.000
end time: 984:37:20.000
confidence: 1.00
F: Are.

start time: 984:38:00.000
end time: 989:50:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: We gonna have them sign even like all the finalists sign something so that we can do the background check? So that when we have that conversation about who we're landing on that they've already had their initial background, their background check done?

start time: 990:03:30.000
end time: 997:23:32.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Yes, for sure. Absolutely. Now, as you might recall, background checks are being done by the district, but two weeks is typically plenty of time for when we do. We typically do the background checks with a third party partner in two weeks is plenty of time. But your question is, I think is, are we going to have those background checks before we deliberate? And I'm going to say we can't deliberate until you have those background checks. So yes, that's what I just want.

start time: 997:23:56.000
end time: 998:40:00.000
confidence: 0.95
D: To make sure that. So we build that into the timeline if the district's doing it.

start time: 998:51:40.000
end time: 999:06:44.000
confidence: 0.59
F: Yeah, exactly.

start time: 999:07:32.000
end time: 1001:06:44.000
confidence: 0.96
D: So that we have. Even if we're doing them on multiple candidates so that they're all done a thousand percent.

start time: 1001:08:12.000
end time: 1002:10:00.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Yeah, yeah. We don't want to deliberate before those are completed.

start time: 1002:41:00.000
end time: 1003:45:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So we might want to start doing that around right after, around the first round.

start time: 1003:46:20.000
end time: 1004:14:38.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Right, exactly. Exactly right.

start time: 1004:16:04.000
end time: 1005:17:10.000
confidence: 0.91
B: So that first round, folks, we should probably just go ahead and just background them.

start time: 1005:26:10.000
end time: 1005:39:10.000
confidence: 0.83
H: Yeah.

start time: 1006:22:10.000

start time: 1007:06:42.000
end time: 1007:30:02.000
confidence: 1.00
D: It took like three days.

start time: 1007:33:06.000
end time: 1008:07:06.000
confidence: 0.97
C: It's like 100 for Sandy.

start time: 1008:08:58.000
end time: 1008:38:30.000
confidence: 1.00
D: No, it's like, it's like 4K.

start time: 1008:46:10.000
end time: 1009:07:54.000
confidence: 1.00
C: What are we looking for?

start time: 1009:09:22.000
end time: 1010:17:14.000
confidence: 0.98
D: That's why they're doing it. You totally want to do it.

start time: 1010:18:42.000
end time: 1010:44:58.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I mean, so 4,000.

start time: 1010:47:14.000
end time: 1011:30:12.000
confidence: 0.94
B: We could come, we could come back on when we're going to do the that.

start time: 1011:31:56.000
end time: 1012:24:40.000
confidence: 0.86
A: So here's why I was asking.

start time: 1012:30:20.000
end time: 1013:43:32.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Hold on, hold on, you guys. We can, we can come back to that. We don't have to discuss that right now.

start time: 1013:45:16.000
end time: 1013:56:04.000
confidence: 0.99
C: My goodness.

start time: 1013:56:52.000
end time: 1014:50:40.000
confidence: 0.89
B: I'm just saying, y'all at 7:00. We got a half hour.

start time: 1015:25:00.000
end time: 1032:41:20.000
confidence: 0.98
F: We do have. If we're good. I'd love to. We have another number of agenda items to get to. We won't get to them all tonight, so we'll probably need to. We will need to come back and visit with you one more time or we'll figure, we'll figure when that can be. But there are some items that are maybe more time sensitive than others on our agenda. And I know 7:45, we want to have a stop time. So if you'd look at your agenda, I think, I think we want to hit number Two. And I think we want to hit number five. And I think we want to hit six and eight, which are both, I think, fairly. Here's what I'm going to recommend that we do and I'm going to turn it over to Christy. I think that we can do 5, 6 and 8 in a reasonable amount of time. Christy. And then go to number two. And then whatever pieces we don't finish, we'll come back to another, another meeting and wrap those up.

start time: 1033:14:20.000
end time: 1048:40:20.000
confidence: 0.96
J: Okay, so agenda item number five is related to the superintendent salary. And we'll need to land on a salary range that we put in the posting and you'll need to deliberate about salary range in public. So Human Capital can get you salary ranges of superintendents in Oregon, but we don't have the ability to get some outside of Oregon. We can get you. Sam Kaiser, Beaverton. We could add Hillsborough if you wanted, but. And we can bring those to you to a future meeting to talk about salary. But as a board, you need to decide are there other places you want to look at salary and can that be something you can ask the district or HR to do on your behalf? So I'll just open it up for discussion.

start time: 1048:56:40.000
end time: 1051:21:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I have a question. So would we not use comparables with other. With other candidates not in Oregon or are we just going to keep it local?

start time: 1051:48:50.000
end time: 1055:39:50.000
confidence: 0.97
J: That's a question for you. Our recommendation would be that you do look at some other comparables outside of Oregon. We just don't have the ability to do that. So you'd need to direct the district to begin that work for you.

start time: 1055:44:50.000
end time: 1065:20:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah. Last time we did like peer districts, like comparable size districts around the country and in districts where we thought were like comparatively comparative size, primarily on the West Coast. And then we also had like an Oregon mix as, as well. And we got, I think we got the information from Council of Great City Schools and we had, we had like a two person board work group that pulled it together. I can, I can forward what we did last time.

start time: 1065:25:30.000
end time: 1067:57:06.000
confidence: 0.93
E: I know that HR at various times has updated a chart for different contract renewals. So I think there's a running start to this work outside Oregon already.

start time: 1067:59:38.000
end time: 1068:30:58.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, let's just pull that. Let's just pull that.

start time: 1068:31:54.000
end time: 1068:54:26.000
confidence: 0.96
E: So we have one already.

start time: 1068:56:58.000
end time: 1069:16:50.000
confidence: 0.71
H: There's one in place.

start time: 1069:18:50.000
end time: 1070:43:46.000
confidence: 0.96
A: We had one in 2020 when we were doing the contract extension.

start time: 1070:45:38.000
end time: 1074:06:38.000
confidence: 0.98
I: My only caution is that sometimes those comparables are hard to do depending on how contracts are structured. So Hank, do I hear you saying that Human Capital doesn't. You don't have a database of.

start time: 1074:07:34.000
end time: 1076:05:30.000
confidence: 0.98
F: We don't we don't keep a database. It was not, was not part of our proposal to do the compensation study. But we do think it's important that you have a compensation study.

start time: 1076:19:50.000
end time: 1081:17:06.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Yeah, it's really important. Yeah, I'm just. I mean, so. Yes, I mean, I know we have something which is great. I want to make sure we actually take the time because sometimes what shows up on the page is the salary. Once you then look at all the other incentives and housing allowances and car allowances, it can be very different between contracts.

start time: 1081:18:58.000
end time: 1084:14:26.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I don't have it in front of me, but my recall is it's pretty detailed by category, which doesn't mean it's got some differences that we need to pay attention to, but can resurrect that.

start time: 1084:16:58.000
end time: 1095:07:10.000
confidence: 0.93
D: So, and this gets into like just the base contract. What we've done, well, I think for the last three superintendents since 2000 is have a pretty straightforward contract. So they got the same benefits as other senior administrators. And then, so really what you're looking at is salary. And then if they're in Oregon, like how their pension or out of Oregon, but there wasn't a lot of other things that we added on. So it was mostly, mostly salary and.

start time: 1095:07:50.000
end time: 1096:15:42.000
confidence: 0.90
A: I think, sorry, relocation and then.

start time: 1096:17:26.000
end time: 1116:55:40.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah, that's pretty stupid. I, I want, if I can just, just distinguish between two things around contract. One is the negotiation contract that you end up negotiating with your finalist at the end. And that's going to include a whole lot of maybe, maybe not smaller kinds of things like mileage reimbursement and cell phone and vacation buyout. However, earlier in the process is when you're going to establish really the salary range. And if you're a prospect for the port school superintendency, you're not at that point looking about is there mileage reimbursement or you're probably not even looking too much about reload, although you might ask in general, but you are looking at, hey, I make $325,000 a year right now. Is PPS going to be an increase or a decrease or about the same? And so for this part of your process, I'd be, I'd be staying big picture. What our salary and maybe TSA kind of that combination. What does that look like in like districts that you want to do a comparison? What does the superintendent make in terms of salary? What is the tsa? If that's not a term you're familiar with, it's like the 403B or 403K equivalent that's going to be enough for early in the process for a candidate to decide do I want this job or do I not want this job.

start time: 1117:08:40.000
end time: 1117:34:24.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Thanks for that clarification.

start time: 1117:36:32.000
end time: 1124:15:12.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So how do we. Or are we at a place now where we can say, okay, we want somebody to. We do want to look at what the national comparables are, and we need to assign somebody to do that. So how do we begin that? If that's something that we want, do we say that now or do what do we have to do to get that process started? Because just looking at Oregon is not sufficient. We need to look at a national.

start time: 1124:16:56.000
end time: 1124:52:48.000
confidence: 0.87
I: We say that now, and Roseanne can communicate that to Sandy.

start time: 1124:53:04.000
end time: 1129:12:24.000
confidence: 0.91
E: And I would tell it to hr. I could tell HR because there's again, there's a running start on this work. They can at least update what we have, do another review of, like, districts across the country. I think I recall some of them from the list, but that would be dangerous.

start time: 1129:13:12.000
end time: 1130:05:28.000
confidence: 0.90
C: Yeah, that would be fantastic. Now, I think if we could get that or get that process going.

start time: 1130:06:24.000
end time: 1130:12:40.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Yeah.

start time: 1130:14:00.000
end time: 1130:42:16.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And then send it tonight before we leave.

start time: 1130:42:48.000
end time: 1152:01:34.000
confidence: 0.97
I: It sounded like this is not the goal of tonight's conversation, but I do want to put on the table. I think we need to build in time to have this very high level conversation about compensation and where we want to be. And I'll just say, because I'm honestly of two different minds, there's the part of me that says we have to be competitive. We're going to get the best superintendent out there. We got to look at what all these comparables are. And if they're paying for it, we know what the comparables are. It's 350 to $450,000 a year and that if we want somebody, we got to pay that. We also know that Oregon is a little different. And we also know that that has been a huge lightning rod in our community. I think there's a really important question and it's kind of the same as, I mean, it's not the same, but it reminds me of the sort of transparency question. Right. It's like we may want to end up down at a lower end knowing that we will lose some top tier candidates who are going to say, oh, I make 350 right now. I'm not going to apply for a job that pays 250 or 300. And I think I want to make sure this board has some time for that because then I will tell you because I'm, I'm actually, I can make an argument on both sides. There's part of me that says, you know, we need to do not just because the reality is superintendents are an inflated market, because it is a very small pool of candidates, which is why it's an inflated market. It's going to be challenging. I'll pull an example. It will be challenging.

start time: 1152:02:22.000
end time: 1155:22:16.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Before we do that, Director Scott, if I may, if I may, just because of the interest of time, this is on the agenda to discuss what the comp should be, and it actually is on that April 9 meeting. So I, I know, Hank.

start time: 1155:22:48.000
end time: 1166:44:31.000
confidence: 0.97
I: Let me just finish up because I think it's an important point and we did take an hour on scheduling, so I think this is more important. My point is that I think it's going to be really challenging. It's not just Oregon superintendents. We will be challenged if, say, we pay our superintendent $100,000 more than the new city manager of Portland, which I don't think we know what that compensation is going to be, but that'll raise questions. People will say, wait a minute, they're running an entire city versus running a school district. Like, what's, what's the difference there? And if we want to go there, and we may, I just want to make sure we've got answers as to why we're paying so much because again, this is a lightning rod in our community. And I just, you know, so I, what I'm saying, Hank, is I want to spend the time in that meeting to talk about that.

start time: 1166:47:35.000
end time: 1167:58:23.000
confidence: 0.96
A: The new city a lot less than a superintendent.

start time: 1168:00:31.000
end time: 1168:25:03.000

start time: 1168:27:51.000
end time: 1168:51:43.000

I: I mean, actually they have no, I.

end time: 1169:31:27.000

end time: 1170:14:50.000

start time: 1170:20:30.000
end time: 1181:42:40.000
confidence: 0.98
F: So if we look at. And actually April, we had Talked earlier about April 9, which is now on your agenda as the date to adopt the next superintendent criteria. And we talked about that being maybe a shorter meeting. However, I am really glad we're having this conversation right now because there's also an agenda item, and you'll see that on your timeline to discuss the salary range. So April 9th is actually both of those things. And I would absolutely agree that you do want to have some ample time to discuss in public session exactly what you started to discuss tonight. So just add a. We'll need to add a little piece of time. Maybe, maybe not so little, but we want to make sure we have ample time on April 9 for that conversation as well.

J: Okay, next item, the second round interview process can involve some community group groups or community Leaders or like community based interviews could have some staff in there. So in other places during the second round, a candidate could meet with like three different panels plus then go into their meeting with the board on their same day. And so every community is a little different. And you're going to want to think thoughtfully about that second interview process and where you' bring in some other stakeholders. So what I'm wondering is if we could assign just a couple board members to work with us on what those second round interviews will look like, both the community side and thinking a little bit about the board at that point too. So I just need a couple board members for that.

More an FYI or let me know if this doesn't work, but it will be translated into Spanish, Vietnamese, Mandarin, Russian and Somali are your top five languages. And as I understand it, that's the languages that you translate everything into. So as long as we follow the protocol that the district usually does. Are you good to go?

Through the communications budget, not this contract going to use Hank's team to help with some of the specific communication content, given some of the how stretched thin the communications team is. So she asked me to provide that update here. It's a very specific focus on helping with those communication, the communications content.

end time: 1281:52:42.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Let's do number two. So number two is. And this might very well take us to 7:45 and we might chair Holland. You might have to cut us off at 7:45 because I know that there are some thoughts on this and this is the notion around to what extent, if at all, the board is intent on identifying publicly the names of your finalists or to what extent the board is comfortable with those names not being announced in public space. And so I really want to sort of pick up where we left off. Obviously there are. There are arguments on both sides of that. Ultimately the board's going to have to land on a decision around that. I don't know if we can wrap that up in the next 28 minutes, but I thought maybe we could try that.

start time: 1281:54:26.000
end time: 1311:03:30.000
confidence: 0.98
I: Maybe wrap it up in a couple. Can I suggest something? So maybe it's a crazy thought, but like, I find myself torn on this one. There are different opinions on the board and I can see the arguments on both sides. And I don't usually like to punt hard decisions because I think we should make them as a board and then just go forward. But here's an. Here's a way we can punt that I think might be effective. My question is, do we need to make the decision about the finalists today? If we, if we are willing to ensure candidates confidentiality through the first stages of the process, can we. And adhere to that? I mean that, that when we get down to that final five or six, which I don't think we should release five or six, for me, the question is, do we, do we not release anything? Do we just essentially announce a candidate or do we release the final two or three finals? That to me is. I know you had talked about five or six, Gary, but my question is, when we get down to that point, we as a board can have that conversation again. And the reason why that might be effective is it's possible that our final five or six, all of them say, oh, yeah, if I become a finalist, you can release my name. That's fine. It's possible that one or two or three of them will say, actually, I'm not sure I would be comfortable with that. And we will then know and have that as not just a theoretical we may lose candidates, but we will know that someone says, I'm not comfortable sacrificing that, if that's your plan, I'm going to withdraw. And we would allow them to withdraw without obviously violating the confidentiality. So it just made me wonder if we, instead of thinking about. Because I think we all agree if we knew we were going to lose the best candidate by making it public, I think we would not. And if we knew that we would build a lot of trust and have a great process by making it public, we would do that. And this gives us a little bit of time to just wait to actually have candidates on the ground who can tell us pretty bluntly what they think.

C: I'm not with five or six. I was actually thinking more like the final three or something. You know what I mean? Like, when we get down to, like the final three, that's when I was thinking, like the five or six. I think we're still dwindling it down. I think we're still trying to get down to some. But when we get down to that last three, that's when I was. That was going to be my suggestion.

start time: 1341:14:20.000
end time: 1343:54:36.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Yeah. So we're very clear with them. Like, when we get to the finalists, you have the opportunity to continue and we're gonna. We may decide to publish your name or you can withdraw and keep your confidential.

start time: 1343:55:08.000
end time: 1352:54:10.000
confidence: 0.94
I: Well, and I think what I'm actually saying is, and I want to be clear, if the majority of the board wants to release those finalist names, then. Then we can make that decision today. Right. Like I said, we don't need to punt. I'm more thinking because of the difference of opinion. Is there some value in waiting? Because again, there might be an incredible candidate who, you know, after we meet in that small session to talk about the five or six, we're like, we are interviewing this person and Hank says, you know, I had a conversation with them and if you're going to release the names, they are not comfortable with that and it might change Gary's mind.

start time: 1353:21:50.000
end time: 1359:57:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah, I guess I'm interested in doing what qualified candidate. And if they're at the point of being a finalist, I would think that they might want to notify their board maybe, hopefully that they are a finalist, but not. But I think it's important to maintain their confidence, confidentiality as long as we can, so we get the best candidate.

B: I guess it just really depends on what transparency mean to us. Right. Like as a district, what do that mean when we talk about transparency? You know, like what Patty's saying is if they know up front that when we get down to the finalist piece. Right. That the names will be released, at least they know it is. My mind is just trying to understand when we talk about transparency, what does that really mean to us? I'll be hard pressed to. For my words to be talking about transparency like we have been talking about for the last couple years. I'm on the board. But then my action does something different. And maybe that's just me. You know, I try to make sure that my words is backed up by my actions. And even though. That we could lose out on a super. I think we could gain a great superintendent as well. Like, it's the coin flips on both sides on that. Right. I'm okay with doing the. Of course I would look at five or six. I'm okay if we did at least the finalists, you know, But I think it's. I think if we really talking about our words matching our actions, we have to actually do the action. And it'd be hard for. And I understand the reasons why. That's. I understand the reasons why and all that stuff. But also, I just. I don't. I don't. How do we, you know, when part of our deliverables was develop a transparent and open process to build the community's trust in the process. I don't see that. How do we do. How do you guys do that?

start time: 1393:44:10.000
end time: 1398:44:02.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I'm gonna answer what in my mind a transparency is. I mean, we. Almost all of our personnel actions in this district, I mean, most of them aren't transparent. Like when we hire fire principals. I mean it. Teachers.

start time: 1398:45:06.000
end time: 1398:49:54.000

F: It's.

start time: 1398:50:42.000
end time: 1418:01:30.000
confidence: 0.94
D: It's not. It's not done publicly. So most of our personal actions. So to me, a transparent process is we're including the community in the most. I think the most important part of the Process which is defining what it is that we want in a superintendent, what are the key competencies. And we're very open about that and we're going to be open about what we're going to pay them and what the, what the contract looks like. So it's not going to be like all of a sudden, the last minute a contract with a whole bunch of things in it that we're going to me an openness about the processes when they've defined the position description along with us that we hire a candidate who matches that position description. And I mean, I'm trying to view. It's like I don't think when you run for the board there's like the five main responsibilities. One of them is like hiring this, the superintendent. And so to me, it doesn't say we have to hire the superintendent, you know, in this particular way. It's like we need to hire the superintendent who's going to be the best person to lead pps.

I: Can I ask if you knew that we would lose three of the top candidates, it would be really good for the district by adhering to those transparency values. Because I want to just be right up front. Your focus on the transparency values is one of the things that's changing my mind about this because I think it's important for me, it's that adhering to our values versus the potential actual impact on the search. And I'm just hypothetically, if you knew that we would lose three top candidates, would you still want to do it? And just know we're settling for B listers because we're adhering to our transparency values.

start time: 1436:16:10.000
end time: 1459:06:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I, I think it's, for me, it's, it's like, oh, how to answer this? It's kind of like if you're asking me if I think because my values that I will not get the right candidate, I. I would have to say no. Like, because if, if I knew that we were going to lose candidates because of. Of my values are the values of that we talk about, we will have to lose them because I feel then we wouldn't have picked the best superintendent for us based on our values. You see what I'm saying? Like if we saying our values is this and almost look like as an integrity thing. Right. And I'm not saying we're not integrity, you know, not using integrity. But if my integrity is saying go this way and I lose things on the way, I'll be okay with that because I know my integrity is intact even if I lost things along the way. So for instance, if I knew I can, you know, sell drugs and make, you know, two or three million dollars a month, or I can use my integrity and go haul scrap metal and make an honest living, I chose going to all scrap metal.

I: And one more sort of non hypothetical but real is just like I. And I think it's okay that I bring this up, but I'm. Because it was public. But you know, when Guadalupe was announced as a finalist for the LA job, that had a pretty negative impact on his reputation here in Portland. And there were just lots of people online and it just became this, oh, he's trying to. Even though he had been here for what, five and a half, six years. Oh, he's a short term reason. He never really was completely. And I think that's what I'm afraid of is that there are superintendents out there who just don't. Again, it's because there are people in their community who will act like that, which I don't think is the right thing to do. I mean, for those people, but they will.

A: I wonder. So I hear what you're saying, Garrett. I really appreciate your honing to your values, but I was wondering about from the perspective of the candidate. The candidate also has values around how they want to show up and when they want to notify their superiors, et cetera, and their reputation back in their home district that they need to maintain while they're also trying to better themselves by looking for their next opportunity. I'm just wondering if we can think about the candidate experience a little bit. Not just our own experience, but what is the candidate experiencing and also maybe try to look for transparency in other ways. I suggested a bio because, yes, you could type in someone's bio and probably find them on LinkedIn. But I was just wondering if it could be anonymized to the point where it's just years of experience and something that they've done for their home district.

B: I'm glad you said that. I'm glad you said that. Sorry. I'm glad you said. Because I actually did think about it from the candidate point of view as well. I was trying to think of as a candidate. I'm like, if, if I'm a candidate, especially knowing how Portland is, would I want to go into a situation where I Am it might be perceived that it wasn't a transparent process. Would I want to come into a system, a system like that? And that's why I did try to look at it as that as well.

G: Appreciate two things. One idea. I have one idea. Because I like the idea of yours because, you know, waiting a lazy possible. See who we got. You know, what if we had. This is just an idea. Like, before they even start, you know, the first question on their application was, would you be okay with your name being released publicly? You know, yes or no. If it's private, then we can make a decision later about if we want to keep this candidate or not. But at least we get to see, like, who we got maybe. And then, you know, second question would be like, prove you're a human. Choose all the crosswalks. And then, yeah, the other issue I also want to bring in because, you know, I'm with you, Gary. I think this is a. This is like, yeah, you got. You got to pick the high road. At the same time, I'm also like, yeah, take a point of view from the candidate. And I just want to say, like, knowing what Guadalupe went through as a person of color, imagine if we had a leader in a different city as a person of color or a woman who are way more scrutinized about their leadership than most people. And so therefore, I think again, like director Silverstein kind of pointed out earlier, this represents an extra barrier, especially to a lot of our leaders of color or female or people who identify as other non CIS categories.

C: If we did. If it was part of the questionnaire, this is. If you are found to be one of our last three finalists and then put the question around that part. Like, I don't think. For me, I'm not talking about everybody. I'm really just trying to get down to, like, the ones that we're really serious about. I do believe that it could cause harm if we're not serious. If we're not really serious about you, then, yeah, I believe there it could cause a level of harm. I think it would be an unintended consequence in that that's not what we were intending to do as we're. Because we're looking to be extremely transparent. We're. What we're really looking to show is that we're leading with our values and not leading with. With something else.

And if that means that we lose something here Then that means that we lose something here. But what we're not going to sacrifice in the process are the values that, that we're building this system on. And so, and that's why, I guess I wonder if we, if we put it in the beginning that this is what we're considering, you know, this is what we're considering. That if you're, if you're found to be one of our final, our last finalists, that this is what our intention is. If you have a, you know, if you have an issue with this or concern with this, please let us know ahead of time. Right now what I feel like I'm doing is I'm actually giving them an opportunity, opportunity to share with me as to, you know, I'd definitely be interested. I want this. And this is, this is why I think understanding the why someone might say, please don't introduce me or might help me make a decision versus me left to my own. Because when I'm left to my own devices, I think evil, you're a liar, you're trying to hide, you're trying to cheat me. Not really. But you know, someone could argue that and I think giving them an opportunity to explain their why around it might also show that we're concerned about, about how what we're considering doing might impact them. And we want that input before we.

D: So I'm going to say having been participated in not just superintendent recruitments but also executive level, often the people who don't want to be public or have their reference checks with their current employees, our employer are people who are women who are the primary support for their families and the jeopardizing. And I do think and maybe that you can get to that why. And that's what I would think in that question. And then it becomes somewhat subjective. Like, okay, if this person isn't this old, you know, like we're going to make them be public. I just think there's a lot of reasons and it's not because people are not wanting to be transparent. It's just most, most employment processes, processes are not by their nature public. I'd like to ask Hank what you think the impact of the process, the process would be on the pool.

F: Sure. Yeah. I mean I, I feel confident that there are a number of sitting superintendents who would immediately say no. Your question is different than what Director Scott was thinking he might want to ask me, which is about his maybe hybrid answer.

end time: 1665:11:36.000
confidence: 0.97
F: I can speak to that too, but why don't I speak to yours first? I mean, there are, there are individuals that we want to reach out to and we will reach out to either way, but we would like to reach out to and we think that there is a decent chance that they would apply for PPs if their names were not relisted. And these are people who are sitting in superintendencies or I can think for instance of two state superintendents of instruction that for different reasons might be interested in moving to Portland. I can't imagine that a state superintendent of instruction. I mean, can you imagine a state superintendent of instruction putting their name in, in the newspaper as a potential finalist for Portland Public and then having to return to a state where they are superintendent of. And again, I can't guarantee who's going to, I mean none of us can. Who's going to say yes or no. But all I can say is from our collective experience, it is the first question or one of the very first questions that sitting superintendents ask. And, and so I, I think it would. If you are looking for somebody who's an experienced superintendent coming to pps, I think it will significantly injure the pool if that's not a high priority. And I'm not saying it necessarily has to be your last. At least two superintendents were not seeing superintendents. It's a little less risky if you're sitting in a deputy superintendent role. It's, it's less risky. And so I don't know that that would be a huge turnoff for a deputy. Could be, but not to the same level. I know that you'll have interest from folks who have been superintendents but are currently not sitting superintendent. So maybe they, you know, left their board or their board, whatever, but they're currently. That's, that's very different situation than someone who is sitting in the chair. So I would say I, I have a lot of confidence. It's, maybe that's the wrong. I have confidence that folks will, will opt out of applying for Portland public if that's the decision. So that would be the answer. And I think, and I might have shared this last time, I think if you look at large, particularly large district searches that are, have been public over the last year, most of the time the finalists are not Sitting superintendents. You might see people in the mix that were superintendents or maybe superintendents of small districts or superintendents who don't have a lot to lose. But for the most part, if you do, if you search recent large district superintendents where there's an open public showing of finalists, you're going to see a whole lot of deputy superintendents and chiefs of staff and a very small number of sitting superintendents. So that's how I'd answer your question. I think if I've been invited to sort of respond to the earlier hybrid. I mean, I think it's really interesting notion. Director SCOTT and we, we learn something new in every single search. And, and I, I wouldn't ever want us to come to a board and say, no, there's only one way to do it. So I think there's some possibilities there. I think there's some cautions there. Could it work? Maybe, I mean, may, maybe it could work where you don't make the decision until, until very late in the process. There's a couple things that I would caution us about. One is you might have folks say, well, why am I going to put my. I mean, it takes a lot of energy to apply for a role and to know that you might go all the way through it. And at the very end, the board's going to say, yeah, well, we've thought about it, but we've decided to go public. I mean, that, that doesn't feel particularly good and that could cause somebody to opt out. I don't know. We've never done it before. So I'm just hypothesizing. I would worry also, and I don't know if this would play out. But what if you had three finalists and what if all three, three of them said no way? So then what are you going to do? Or, or maybe, maybe at that moment you would decide that you're going to not go public because you don't want to lose all of your finalists. There's a statutory piece, and I might, I might. I mean, if this is the direction you want to go, I'd want to work with Liz to get a legal guidance, because typically you make your decisions around process in public space, not an executive session. So I'm, you know, and maybe that's just a granular piece, but we'd have to figure out where you make that decision, because I don't know that you could make such a decision in an executive session meeting. So could it be done? Maybe. And could it, could it actually thread the needle that we're trying to do maybe. So I, I, I think it's an interesting, creative notion, and I'd also want to give it a little more thought. And I might actually, since I don't need to be the one doing all the talking, I might ask Hector and Christy if, if you had answers to either of those questions as well.

H: I have a question, Gary. So how do you see it as more transparent having the three people say, we have three at the end who are talking? I guess you want the public to hear them give presentations, then we're talking to them and we talk amongst ourselves about the different qualities that we're looking for. So sounds to me like the board's being transparent. Is that right? So we'll be discussing, are we in front of the public when we discuss who we want for? No, we're not at all. We're never talking.

C: The only time, based on the way, the way Hank, as I understand it, the way that Hank has outlined it, is the only time that we would release a name is after we have already decided that this is who we're going to go with. So then the public doesn't, Joe Public or Susie Public doesn't know anything about who we were interviewing or any of those things. All they know is the last thing that they were a part of. If I'm, if I'm understanding this correctly, the last thing that they were actually a part of was the surveys and the search criteria. After that, the board is doing the work of doing the interviews, and then we can't talk about it to the people. We can't share information around who we've interviewed, what we liked about it or what we didn't like. We have to keep all that close, close to the breast, close to our chest or whatever. And then we, we get all the way through. We wind all the way down. So now we go from, from 10 to 6 to 5 to 3 to 2 to 1. And then this whole process from a community perspective has been done in a vacuum behind closed doors. I don't know what y'all were doing in there. All I know is that I gave y'all some criteria, and I'm hoping that y'all were, you know, that y'all were doing it. And so then we come out and say, this is who we've decided to go with. This is who we're selecting. And it was a trying interview process. It took us a lot to get down to this one. But this is who it is. And From a community perspective, they were like, wait a minute, wait a minute. When did y'all start interviewing? The last I heard, we were just talking about the criteria. When who came in? What was the other person?

D: I can tell you. Like, so, for example, we had like every two weeks we provided updates. Like, we had 35 applicants. They were from more than six different states. They were national and local. They were from large districts, small districts, they were from traditional superintendent candidates, and there were some non traditional. So you give them the scope and as you move along, you can still provide a sense of where you are in the process. Like, we're still trying to find that person that matches the position description. I guess from my viewpoint is I feel like we got elected to do this job. We tell them like, they're helping set the criteria. But so say if we said, here are the three people we interviewed, I'm still going to pick the person that matches the criteria. I'm gonna use my judgment, you know, based on a whole host of information, not just the interviews on, like, who's the best match. But I'm not going to be like, hey, the crowd is telling me I.

G: I wanna. What you said was kind of. I think the root of the argument too is also what is the value of the transparency? For example, if they get to see everything that happens, does it actually really matter in the end? Because a. Like you said before, we were elected to pick the superintendent, that was one of our main jobs that the public voted us to do, whether they wanted to or not. But that's a different argument. But at the same time, what is the value of the transparency? Right. Like if I'm Joe public, Jane public, something public, and I get to see what happens, does it make a difference? Because it's not like I can really, you know, I can send some public comment in, I can email the board, but it's not really going to change the outcome.

But I'm just saying, like that's where I, my concern is with the individuals in their careers. But I don't know, that's just my question. It's like the fundamental question is what is the value of this part of the transparency? I mean for the budget thing, that's a good question. We should talk about that more.

It's gonna be hard for me to talk about transparency and my actions is different and however that looks is that it's going to be hard for me to do that. So for instance, as an example, someone asked me, we got down to the final three and somebody ask me, who is it? It'll be hard for me just to be like, oh, can't say nothing. That's going to be hard for me. And I don't know if I will do that because my value is my value.

G: See, this is why like I was asking, like it was possible, maybe on the first question would be like, would you like your name kept private? Because then if they said no, then you can be like, oh yeah, I can talk about this candidate, but this candidate then now if they ask about the other candidates, I can say, well this candidate has to be private so I'm respecting their privacy wishes. Just like for example when we talk about candidates, when we're terminating candidates and some of them say they don't want their names to be released, we respect that. It goes the other way too. I defer to. I would like to do what the candidate wishes. This is such a long process. It's a difficult process. It's risky for some people. It's not risky for others. I think everyone has a different story. And like Herman, what you said before that really spoke to me is like they can explain the why and we get to learn from that. And that appeals to me probably more than anything else right here.

J: Can I add one little piece of information too that might help the. It's Eddie and Michelle who are going to help design that second round interview process. And within that second round interview process, you can have some community based panels where you have some teachers, some CBO execs, you put them into a lottery, you know, some administrators, you can go through whatever categories you want and then a candidate can interview with those three panels and those panels sign confidentiality agreements. But the way you demonstrate your transparency is you're bringing in a group of people to help you with the process and then you're getting the feedback. So that's one little piece you haven't talked about. You can go to some, that racial justice partners group and, and ask for two people from that that goes so you can get some more community into that second round process. And that's part of what that working group is going to work on. So just another little bit of information for you.

A: So, Christy, I, I was invited to one of those panels for a director level for at the city and it was kind of a lottery system. But maybe that's a way also all of our board members could suggest a couple people. So that way, you know, everybody's got their people in the room and of those people there's a smaller subset or that's. Maybe that's one panel. Yeah.

start time: 1839:00:22.000
end time: 1850:55:30.000
confidence: 0.97
J: And you can decide how you want to. That's your decision to decide how you want to populate those panels. And every district does it a little differently. And the experience we've had is that those people, when they sign that confidentiality agreement, it's been rock solid on keeping it confidential. But it's another way to demonstrate you've brought in your community to help you with the decision because then you're taking their feedback. Then they see every candidate, every candidate has the same prompt. It gives it a fair, a level playing field for the candidates too, versus some of the public forums when they're just all peppered with different questions. So, something else to think about.

F: And I might add, the other piece of that is that through your communications you're widely announcing and publicizing that as a part of the process so that your public knows that these 12 or 24 or 36 people, you may or may not name, name names. But if you're routinely informing your public, this is the next step of the process and we're going to be building community panels and this is how the panels will be pulled. Usually there's at least some element of lottery in those panels so that everybody in the community at least could potentially have their name pulled out of hatch. That does, that does buy an awful lot of goodwill in terms of community thinking. Like, oh, okay, it's not just seven members of the board behind closed doors making a decision. I would agree you don't want your public thinking that, but that's not actually how it happens. It happens through a narrower number, but nonetheless a group of community members who hopefully are a microcosm of your community doing the deep dive, doing the interviews, as Christy said, signing the confidentiality affidavits, but publicizing that so that your public knows this is the process.

confidence: 0.94
A: And that does. That's a level of transparency in the process, which I think is great. I'm going to add also, like those community panels were also very clearly told that you're not making the decision, you're helping to inform, you know, inform the process, but not making a decision. So that's also being transparent in terms of how any community members input would be utilized or not.

Are you going to want them to live within Multnomah county or within a certain distance of Portland public? So that's, again, something that people are interested in when candidates are applying and something we'll want to start talking to people about. So we're anxious to hear your thoughts around the superintendent moving within your district boundaries.

start time: 1920:05:00.000

start time: 1938:48:16.000
end time: 1947:55:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: One thing you might want to consider, and I know it's. Sometimes it's hard to do this in the abstract when you don't know the candidates. But really you're giving talking points to the three of us about what to say to candidates. But one thing to consider is, let's hypothetically say you have a really strong candidate who lives in Gresham. Does that person. It's less of an issue really if somebody's moving into Portland from another city because they probably will land in the jurisdiction. But what if they live in Gresham? Their kids go to high school in Gresham or Beaverton or Tigard. That's really often where it becomes more of an issue is, okay, do I need to sell my house and.

D: Only under the circumstances that Hanks said, would I maybe consider it. I'd like to say, I mean, we ask a lot of our community in the way of taxes and to say like, I think it creates just something different. Like, hey, you're proposing all these things and spending this money, but you're not. You've chosen not to live within the PPS boundaries as long as it ain't.
