F: Well, a few weeks ago, I had a chance to speak with Army Instructor Sergeant Rob Aguilar, who teaches at Oregon City High School. He's one of the two staff members leading the JROTC program. And the purpose of my conversation with him was to learn a little bit more about jrotc. Oregon City High School is the closest high school that offers the program and one of maybe two in the state or one. There's a program at Mattress that is currently not running because of staffing shortage. So army instructor Aguilar really wanted to emphasize that JROTC is a leadership program. It's not a recruiting program. It's a program that's about values and life skills. And he sees it as an opportunity to prepare students for life beyond high school. Oregon City High School average is about 100 cadets a year. And their program, like all other GRLTC programs, have at least two staff members. Department of Defense typically pays for one of them. The host school district pays for the other. So he shared that with me as well. All qualified staff members are retired, are retired from military within the last three years. And when they transition into schools, they are licensed through cte. They have typically three years to meet those licensure requirements. As I mentioned, school districts pay for one of the two instructors typically, and Department of Defense pays for all necessary gear. And there was a significant shortage nationally where about 400 GRPC positions were not funded or not properly staffed throughout the country. And as I mentioned, Madras High School used to have a program, but they don't appear to have one this year because of the staff shortage. So that's what I wanted to share today. A little bit more information about GRTC from one of our neighborhood or high schools nearby.

A: I can't see everybody because the screen is still up. So I don't know how to do that. Or maybe I just make it smaller so that I don't. There we go. So, Philippe, thank you so much for that information. Since I've spoken to you and since you've shared about it. I also reached out to Oregon City. I also reached out to Vancouver. I also reached out to Bend, who has one that's functioning the Madras situation. I did try to find out a little more information about the mattress situation. Madras is different in that it is a, it's a rural county. And so when you're out in a rural space and you're looking for retirees, there's not a lot of people retiring to Madras. I mean, it's, I mean, that just is what it is. Portland is somewhat different in that Portland is a major city and there's a lot more people retiring to Portland. So Portland may not have the same, the same stipulations or the same issues with finding someone to, to sit in and to, to be the, the coordinator. Then there's also the, the funding piece. I looked into that because Director Wong suggested that if you're going to look into it, we need to look into it, all the different things, pros and cons. And so I looked into the funding and there is space for conversation with the DOJ as where they would pick up more of the tab than they have in the past as a pilot. And that would be under the, with the stipulation that, you know, we're going to truly evaluate it, see what's working, see what's not working, and then readjust and pivot where necessary. I want to be clear that the program that we're talking about is not for every PPS student. It is not going to be something that every PPS student is going to want to do, desire to do, feel like they should be doing. This is going to be something. When we start looking at our graduate, our graduate portfolio, and we start looking at the different multiple pathways to graduation, this is going to be for the students that want this. I want to be very clear. This is for the students that want it. If the students don't want it, don't want that, then it's not for that student. But for the students that do want it, then it is our job to make sure that we give them the opportunity to make a decision for themselves and not make the decision for them by not even allowing the decision to be on the table. That's the issue that I see with this right now. We're removing their ability to make a cognitive decision by not even putting a decision on the table for them to say yes or no to. Thereby what we're doing is making that decision on their behalf. And that's what I want to move away from. So I'd love to have some more conversation. I know that Mike is there. I know that I believe someone else may be there as well, but I want to have A dialogue around what does it look like for it to be operating within PPS for the students that are going to benefit from it.

B: Was there more? Yeah, I mean, I'm open to discussion. I guess to start off, I have lots of questions which is, you know, if we're taking on this program, I am. I'm going to be 100% transparent and very skeptical. Only because, you know, I grew up in Chicago where there was heavy recruiting by the military, especially among our poorest areas. And you know, it was, you know. So I have kind of mixed feelings about this now. Again, nothing I say has anything to do with the people who serve. I have the utmost respect. What I want to talk about is just in terms of the. As a whole, you know, because the way I see, you know, when we're talking about, especially in times of shrinking budgets, right. When we provide a program, I guess I have a couple questions. Does that mean we are also need to replace something else or that kind of funny could have gone somewhere else. My second question is also what Again, I'm always open to be convinced. I try to stay as open minded as possible. My second question is also, has there been a demonstrated need for it that we're trying to fill with this? Does that make sense?

start time: 211:59:10.000
end time: 284:42:00.000
confidence: 0.97
A: No, it makes perfect sense. And so I. One of the things that I want to make sure that we do. One of the things I love most about you, Director Wong, is that you do come into a conversation open versus being closed off, as in from the gate. We don't need to be doing this and this is terrible. So I like the fact that, that we come in open from a budgetary perspective. I agree with you 100%. We just went through a budget crisis and we were. We've already said that we are deficit budgeting and that now for everything that we're doing right now, there's going to have to be like where there's a trade off. Where is that coming from? And that's where I believe that we go back and we say, okay, this is our, this is our baseline. This is where we're at. If this is going to happen, then this is how it needs to happen. This is, this is what it needs to look like from a budgetary perspective. This is what it needs to look like from a, from a management perspective. So I believe that we're in a space where we can direct that traffic. I'm also concerned as well about recruiting. I don't think that we should be heavily recruiting our students. Let me take my Hand down because I'm actually talking. I don't think that we should be doing like this heavy recruiting aspect. I believe that what GRTC offers though is a leadership curriculum. So every other program, all the other different programs that we come in, they have, they have a curriculum, right? And that curriculum curtails how what they're going to come in with and then what they're going to know at the end of that curriculum. So when we look at it from the, from the curriculum and what the students are going to learn and what they're going to gain, then we have to ask ourselves again, are we trying to make the decision for the students because of our own bias? Right? And so no one looks at our, our CTE programs that have a curriculum and say, you know, I've got this bias because we're going to be pushing people towards sheet metal work or we're going to be pushing people towards becoming an electrician or are we going to be heavily recruiting people to become carpent? Are we going to be heavily recruiting people to become plumbers? I mean these are CTE programs and these are different curriculum based programs. And we don't have the same, we don't have the same bias because you know, for one reason or another, we've put, we place value on what is okay and what is not based on our lens and how we're viewing things. So we're looking at this saying based on my lens. The military has a bad track record of trying to recruit kids and I'm not trying to send my kids off to war and I don't want my kids to die when the reality is we got more kids dying going to plat pantry, we got more kids dying going to a, a house party. We, we got, we got kids dying just coming to school. So we have to remove this bias that says I'm afraid that they're going to die. Unless we're going to look at everything across the board and say we have to prevent, we have to stop, we have to eliminate and we're going to not make it available for everything across the board. So our kids can no longer go to plant pantry, they can no longer go to house parties, they can no longer go to, you know what I'm saying, to so and so's house. Because they might die, we all might die. But that's not what this is about. This is about our, what are they learning? The kids are going to learn based on the curriculum. What does the curriculum state? So let's look at the curriculum and if we Find in the curriculum that there's something that is heavy on recruiting, then I say, now we got something to talk about. If we find in the curriculum that something is heavy on pushing towards the military, then now we got something to talk about. But if the curriculum doesn't state that, then how is that part of the conversation?

start time: 285:57:00.000

C: I just would like to know how it would work physically. Like, would it just be one school? Would it be taught during the school day? Would it be after school? How many people just kind of the nuts and bolts of how it would work? Because right now it just seems kind of out there without any kind of plan.

start time: 292:41:40.000
end time: 345:08:30.000
confidence: 0.97
A: No, and I believe that that is where we would bring in the experts and then we would, you know, that's where we would bring in Dr. Proctor, who is over curriculum and over, over schools. And, you know, and she would, she would be able to look at it and say, this is how it could work. This is what it could look like and this is the way that it could play out. I feel like our staff. So the reality of this. And I want to be 100% transparent because that's the, that's the only way I live. We are not fighting a. We are not fighting a right or wrong battle. This is political. So this is, this is going to get politics. And so then you're going to have the warmongers who are going to come in and they're going to be saying, you know, we hate the military because the military has done this. And you know, we're, we're. This. And we're, you know, we need to be there and you need to let us know. Well, I'm going to say, I didn't see you at the Bend board meeting. I didn't see you at the Oregon City board meeting. So is that because it's okay for white students to be educated? It's okay for white students to get leadership capabilities, okay for, for white students to have the opportunities to succeed and their graduation rate to go up. But for us, when we're trying to give it to schools that are, maybe they do have some minorities, maybe they don't. But we're trying to give our schools that have a low graduation rate, schools where we have kids that are not showing up, we're trying to give them another opportunity, something else to look at. Now you want to come in and say something. I got a problem with that. I got a problem with that. It's our job to provide opportunities. It's our job to provide education. It's not our job to take away decisions from our students. And that's what we're doing by not giving them the option. Dr. Proctor and her team, her staff, I'm not, That's not what I do. They can come in and tell us how it needs to work. Because, Patty, like, I agree with you, right now I'm at a hundred yard mark, Like I'm way out here looking in saying, we need to do something bigger, we need to create more opportunities. And this isn't going to be the last opportunity that I bring forth to the student success committee as far as, like different things that I want to see our kids doing. You asked, how does it, how do we start? I don't think that right now that we should do it in every school because I feel like we need to prove it right. We need to prove whether or not this can be successful. And why would I? I don't want to waste a lot of our school's time. So I want to find one school that we can pilot this through. Let's create a pilot in a single school similar to what we have done with, with sitting, where they have a pilot program function in their school. And now we've actually seen these games that have happened and taken place in their school where, you know, so let's do a pilot in one of our schools and then let's see how it works and then let's critique it, let's evaluate it, let's come back and see are we getting the results that we wanted to get. And if we are, then boom, we do it again. If we're not, then we pull out.

end time: 387:20:06.000

F: I can, I can share a few things. Hopefully they'll be helpful. So I think underneath some of this is the question of why do our schools offer the courses that they offer and who decides and who determines what is offered where? So in all of our high schools, we have a set of courses that are required for students to graduate from high school. Those decisions are made by the state of Oregon, Oregon Department of Education. Some of those decisions are made by the school board, pps, school board. And based on those decisions, schools identify what courses they have to offer. In addition to those courses schools offer, also offer a menu of elective options. And typically, those decisions around what additional courses to offer are preceded by some level of community engagement. Conversations with teachers, conversations with students. Oftentimes, there are conversations in site councils where schools make some determinations around what additional courses they're going to offer. So one thing that I would suggest is that if we collectively, whoever the we is, believe that JROTC should be presented as an option for schools as a course to offer. I imagine that our schools will want to make sure that there's some community engagement at the site level to determine level of interest from students, from families, from, from staff. There are some logistics involved. We have a district course approval committee. We have a committee of staff members that follow a process in determining what courses, when recommended, will be approved and not. And so if JROTC was going to be recommended by our school, it would go through a process, an approval approval process. And then there is an additional layer of us as a school district actually submitting an application to Department of Defense to be a host GRPC site. I. There's a form to be submitted. One thing that I have heard is that because there is a shortage, Department of Defense will want to make sure that there is sufficient student interest.

B: Right.

start time: 387:28:30.000
end time: 410:01:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: And so that's why that community engagement process is both an opportunity to evaluate the level of interest, but also to perhaps engage in some, some, some marketing, some, some information sharing, some generating of. Of excitement. So those would be some of the steps that I see as, as important. Community engagement, actual submission of the course approval for the, for the course approval process, and then some interfacing with Department of Defense. So in my mind, this is not, you know, something that we can do tomorrow. I think we probably, if there's interest here, that's probably something that we would look at for the following school year because our high schools are beginning forecasting process in January. In other words, high schoolers will be choosing courses for next school year shortly after winter break, probably end of semester one. So you probably want to spend the rest of this year early into next year to just do some additional exploring around is there high school that's of interest? What is the community engagement process that needs to happen and then take it from there.

H: Yeah, Philippe, I wanted to jump in here if I could. You know, I think we, you know, with, with this coming up and, and the work that we're doing to look into this, we could continue with that process because we know that it's going to have to take a process. I wonder what, what has to happen? Or you're talking about the forecasting of grades or class forecasting. Could you say a little bit more about that? Is that the course catalog that we complete and then we have all course codes for the schools to select from?

start time: 422:30:46.000
end time: 437:42:52.000
confidence: 0.96
F: That's right. So we're in the process of finalizing the course catalog, district course catalog, which high schools will then look at, what are the menu, what are the courses that are available in our school district? And then they'll make determinations about which of those courses will appear in their school course catalogs. So all the high school principals with their counselors and scheduling teams will look at the district course guide and say, okay, of all of these courses, these are the ones that will appear in our individual schools. And then students will begin selecting those courses in, in January. So I would say any effort to add to the course guide for next school year? We're, we're, we're. I don't think we have the time to do that, but what could we.

H: So let's, let's go back as a team, Christina, Philippe and I, and just kind of look at what, what that can look like. And then what else did you say are next steps in the process to continue to explore? Is it the community engagement?

start time: 444:22:00.000
end time: 457:06:20.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Well, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around what exactly we're talking about. If the ask is to find one high school that might serve as a pilot site, to me that sounds like a good idea, a good starting place. If that is the ask, then my next step would be to connect with high school principals and see if any of them are interested in engaging in this conversation further. And then beyond that, I think we would need to work with them to develop a community engagement process where families, teachers, students would have a chance to, I think, engage in the conversation that we're having here.

start time: 457:28:40.000
end time: 474:26:20.000
confidence: 0.97
H: So, okay, so let's look at putting together proposed next steps. What I do here, and I'm going to ask for clarity from our directors as far as which pursuit would they like us to engage? Is it community engagement to look at, to take the full process, to understand how we can build this forward? Or is it looking at a pilot for one high school? And then we will look at engaging within the high school itself. Is it pilot or is it let's go full scale or what's the direction? I want to make sure that we have that.

A: I would think that we would be looking at the pilot first. Right. I don't, before we say I don't want to make decisions for anyone, I want to. Let's reach out to our principals and let's see if there's any. The desire from there. Right. Because the last thing that we want to do right now is make someone feel like we're forcing them to eat something. Right. I want kids to have an option and I want them, I want them to be able to Say no. If they want to say no, I need them to be able to say no. But we got to give them something that they can say no to. So let's do the same thing with the, with the principals. Let's give them an option, say, hey, look, we're considering this, and, you know, it's come up, and we want to know, are there any principals out there that would even be remotely interested in doing something like this? Before we even go down this road to start trying to engage with your students and engaging with your community, is this going to be too much for you? So if we get the principal feedback first that says, yes, I'm interested or no, I'm not, then from there, then we can say, okay, it looks like we've got a principal. We might even find out that we've got three or four principals that are interested. They just never, they never had the opportunity to say no. No one ever asked them or they felt like they weren't going to have a board, a district that was going to support them in doing this, and they weren't ready for the political backlash that was going to come from something like this. So they were, they were hands off. But if it looks like the board and the district is actually coming to you saying, hey, is this something that you're interested in? Because we believe that this could work, but we want to make sure that you feel like it could work in your school, we might be surprised in what we get back. So I'm wanting to get surprised and what we get back from that, then I'd say, okay, now let's go to the, let's go to that school specifically work with the administrator at that school and let's, let's reach out to the students in that school and say, hey, this is something that we were thinking about. Are anybody, is there anybody in this school, are there any young people, any students in this school that might be interested in something like this? Because again, it's for the kids. So the kids say, yes, no, maybe, I don't know. So then we go from there. And I believe that the focus needs to remain the curriculum and what they're going to learn. Not to say that. We don't, we don't speak to the other aspect of it. But I shouldn't say but because, but means disregard everything that I just said and focus on what I'm about to say. And, and, or, or however. I, I don't want us to be tainted by bias because now we have a bunch of adults who come in and they start subliminally, subliminally sending messages out saying that this is bad. Now, I know I'm not the only person that believes that people send subliminal messages around what they like or what they don't like. So I want us to be intentional about recognizing our own biases and ask ourselves, are we allowing our biases to prevent us from allowing someone else to make a decision about their future and not mine? Because again, remember, you've lived your life, you've had your time in the sun. Let's let these kids live their life and let's let them have their time in the sun. And let's, let's teach them how to make a decision for themselves by arming them with enough information to say yes or no. And then from that, then they say, okay, we got some buy in from the students. Now let's pull in the rest of the community. Let's pull in the surround. Let's all the parents that, that are going to be connected this. Are you aware that your kids are interested in this? Are you aware that your kids are talking about that? Let's do a, a communication piece that speaks to all of the, all of the aspects of it. And now let's make sure that we arm the, the parents with information so that the parents can now jump in and say, I don't know if I, if I like this for my kids or don't like this for my kids. And let's make sure that we're speaking to the community that's going to be impacted by it and not some outside community that is completely detached but yet feels they have the right to make a say in something that does not mind them. So let's make sure that the people that we're speaking to are the people that are going to be impacted by it and not just the ones who want to come in and so bias. And then from there we can decide how quickly we roll it out. Bada bing, bada boom.

E: Yeah, I just want first say thank you, Director Green. It's been great to see how invested you are into this, but I think, really, I think I hear you saying, you know, we don't want to, you know, make those decisions for our students, but I think it would be interesting to see, I know with seeing what, just reading and just hearing from you, how you talked about, like, their leadership values and the skills they'll gain, but I think to me it seems like an even bigger conversation, maybe some sort of like, survey, and there's like a selection of these, you know, programs like this. And I do wonder if this is like an elective. Is this an after school thing? And you know, obviously just hearing like some like the budgetary restrictions we're going in, just hearing like some of the trade offs and it's like for example, it's like if we can get, you know, an extra mental health support, would that kind of conflict with this jrotc? I think there to me it's just I haven't heard any interest from students from this. I do, I think just hearing from it, I think it, there's. I see lots of the benefits, but I do see a lots of the downsides and the trade offs and just like understanding kind of like the logistics, like how we make this possible and like where would this be? Like houses in like a PE place. Would that, you know, take away from a PE class? And just hearing like lots of more. I think to move on more with this. I think we need to start with student engagement and just getting out the logistics first and kind of opening this conversation to the district student council, seeing where their stance is at.

And it feels like there are several questions you just asked here that we just need more information. I've heard things around curriculum like as I'm just kind of reading through, I think before we take it to principals, we would have to have a solid understanding about is this, this is an elective opportunity.

Their students talked, how they felt about it and hearing from what their building admin felt about it as well. I think, you know, I think we should really engage with as well as our educators too how they feel about attention to like a little, little temperature check to see how they may feel about it and see if there's any like more insight on the situation.

H: I think because we have some schools. I think I heard that we have some neighboring schools or districts that have these programs. Would it be worthwhile to take a subcommittee of this committee to take a look at as we're exploring. Right. Because it's often so. I want to say clearly that I have come from systems where they have had JROTC programs at if not the majority of or then almost all of the high schools and it was representative of all of the armed forces. But there was never. I've seen it work well. I've seen leadership development in students. I've seen students have a strong sense of belonging and connection where otherwise they perhaps would not have had this sense of belonging and connection. They learned a lot. They participated in drills and drills are competitive. You could compete with other neighboring like to say schools or districts for similar to how you have chair drills or chair competition or these types of activities. Through their programs they have drill competition with other JROTC programs and getting awards again and building a sense of team and. And camaraderie and such. But these are systems where this. I came into a system where it was already happening. It had been happening for decades. It still happens today. These programs are just a part of the overall programming that they offer to students at the high school level. And it's based on student interest. And yes, students have an opportunity to graduate, graduate with a cte, graduate with dual enrollment also while they're participating in JROTC and graduate with a myriad of options. But there's nothing that says that the student has to go into the military. And oftentimes those students are really pursuing. If you know about the military, the various universities, the Navy program and army have full university programs where students would get full scholarships. So there are a lot of opportunities that I see with this because, you know, context matters. We and being in, you know, Pacific Northwest, ideas and approaches are different. It has not been done, I don't think here in this district at all. And it doesn't look like there are. It's not a practice. But we will still have to engage community students and go through the full exploration at some point to bring people along. And I wonder if part of bringing people along or to help them to understand because you can't ask people to share their ideas or views of something that they haven't seen, they haven't touched. They, they maybe other than hearing a particular rhetoric that says it's bad for this reason or that reason, you know, I think people should have an experience. So if we could connect with a program that, that could be visited and to see what the benefit. What the benefits and challenges. What the challenges would be as well.

F: Yeah, Dr. Proctor, I was thinking the same thing, so thank you. I'm hearing a desire to learn more. I'm hearing there's a desire to engage and to find a way to move forward. And I wanted to offer that I can reach out to Army Instructor Sergeant First Class Rob Aguilar at Oregon City High School and either ask him to join us here to share more about his experiences as the army instructor at Oregon City, or I can ask him if he would be willing to host a small group of us and we can visit Oregon City High School and I can see if any of the high school principals would be interested to join us. So I'm not sure if either of those ideas sound like a good next step. In other words, either a visit or.

To go and be a part as well so that they can be a part of these site visits and maybe it counts as a. A day for. So that they're not missing Any classwork, maybe it can be during a time where I. I don't know. Let's work with the. I figure out a way for our, our students to be part of the process the whole way versus us coming back and saying this is what we saw. Allow them to see it firsthand, allow them to ask their own questions and that sort of thing. Is that possible to figure out as we're looking at the exploration process?

F: Yeah. I'm happy, like I said, to reach out to Oregon City and just ask if we can visit and maybe get more information about how big the group can be. And I agree with you that students should be part of the process from the get go. And starting with our student reps here, I think is a good place to start. Would you want to come?

B: I'll put my faith in jj. This is a really good conversation. I'm glad. But I do agree with you. I think we need to start with our kids first, our students first, because they're the ones that should be guiding this conversation. The other thing I do am worried about, and I'll still keep repeating this over and over again, is that, you know, we're working off a pie, not a fountain.

start time: 744:21:26.000
end time: 744:28:22.000

E: Right.

start time: 744:30:06.000
end time: 759:35:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Which means that if we're putting effort into this, what are we trading off? Repeating what you said earlier. We're trading. We have to be trading off something else. Now I'm just curious, like with the same amount of effort, does that mean, are we foregoing like potentially turning another school into an IB school? Right. Which would be something I would be very interested in. But we'll talk about that later. But I'm just. Yeah. So I think the idea, Dr. Proctor, of a subcommittee, maybe, maybe Director Green, if I can volunteer you and JJ and you can pick what you want to bring along. So I think I'm kind of in a position like stated earlier was I think I don't have enough information to really decide one way or the other. So I think a subcommittee idea is a great idea.

start time: 759:54:50.000
end time: 778:35:20.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I think the other thing that I would just offer is that schools go through a process of thinking about what CTE programs they want, what is it, the menu of offerings that they want to have. So we have a process where students, or, excuse me, where schools address readiness and sort of program, you know, portfolios that they're putting together for their sites. So I think this would fold into that process. It also begs the question, as Director Green stated, how are CT programs doing? Who are they serving? Do we know what that looks like. And it's also been part of the advanced coursework that we've been looking at thinking about what, what are the ways that students are demonstrating college and post secondary readiness. So college and career readiness, which is one of the board goals that, that has been in sort of. It's not really a formal board goal, but we keep checking on it. So this again will help provide context as to who is taking advantage of what. What is the body of students that are doing those things. And this then pinfold into that same conversation that we've suggested.

start time: 781:45:00.000
end time: 783:38:00.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Director Greenish I just let you guide the next direction.

start time: 783:46:20.000

confidence: 0.97
A: I will connect with. I need to get some contact information for JJ so that I can, as I'm, as I'm making these different connection points and conversations that I can figure out how I can loop him into these conversations. And I believe between the two of us, we can create a strategy that is both open to possibilities as well as making sure that we are being inclusive of the student. And I would say the, the, the entire student body and, and not just some of the student body. So for, for this type of activity, we're not looking for the student, you know, let's be realistic. The, we're looking for the ones that don't feel connected already to something like they, they don't, they haven't found their place yet. They haven't found yet. They need something and they're just not quite getting it. And so that person realistically doesn't come to the DSC site council meeting. They don't come because they're barely coming to school maybe. So we need to figure out how we're going to connect with the entire student body and not just the ones that, that show up to, to all the meetings. Is that if that makes sense. Right? It's. And, and that's been the, I know that's been the one of the, the battles that DSC has been fighting for, for years now because it's been, you know, when I was at Roosevelt all the time and Philippe was there, it was hard for us to try to put together the DSC and get the, the site council, the students to come together to even know what it was like. What is that? What do they do? What do they talk about? And then the students that did showed up, they all dressed the same, they all thought the same, they all ate at the same place. They, they were the same students. I'm looking for the students that, that we're not connecting with. I'm looking, I'm looking for Antoine. I'm looking for Steve. I'm looking for Bobby. I'm looking for little Billy. Looking for the ones that don't quite feel connected. They haven't found their place yet. They need something. And so that's why I want to work with jj. He can help us figure out how we're going to connect with every student and not just one. So the more student involvement I can get to help me with that process, then the more I can channel my energy, my resources, my finances. I'm not asking the district to pay for something that I. If I want a survey and I want everybody to do it, then I'll pay the students to take the survey. I don't need the district to do that for me because I got my own money. So whatever. I just want to talk to the people. So you get me in the room, I'll do the rest. Great.

H: I think Miles had to leave, but I was just gonna say I would be interested, Director Green too, and helping JJ part of that process. Because I think like student transparency is very important. And with what you were talking about, I totally agree with how we can oftentimes, like even though we might do it like subconsciously, like we veer towards like one group of audience, like one type of people. And so I'd interested in helping out with like reaching out to affinity groups and people that identifies people of color and lower income families and communities since those are the people that are most in those situations. And I'd be willing to help with that outreach and stuff to get student input and I can send you my contact info or something.

C: I haven't spoken with building leaders directly about it, but we do have a process every year, as I said, where we engage and say, you know, what are the things they're thinking about? And to Director Green's comments as well. The question is how do you get, how do you, how do you understand the level of interest from students about any course that we're offering? And this would be part of that same process. So we, we have done a variety of surveys over the years, at different sites we've had, we work closely with counselors and folks from chief staff to go out and work with kids directly and talk through what are the ways that we want to keep kids engaged in school and what brings them to school. So I think that there are mechanisms that we can do.

Right now, their phone numbers are in my phone. So there are three principles already on deck, and I'm still choosing to say we only need one. We choose one, we do a pilot and we show that it works. We, we walk, we. We crawl, we walk, we run. There's no reason to just, just throw it all out there. Let's crawl first, little baby steps, then we'll start walking and then we can take off and run after we've proven the process. But yes, to answer the question of is, are there principals out there that want it? I have three confirmed that said, absolutely, yes. They're just, they're just not sure that this district will support them because of the political. The political backlash that may or may not come. My response is, you do education. Let me focus on politics. Because your job is to educate, not to do politics. I'll do all the politic. If everybody. It's good, they'll slash my tires again. But just think, I got four brand new tires. Brand new. And all I had to pay was 250 for them. So I'm gonna win every time.

I worked in Portland public schools as a special ed assistant, an after school program instructor, and a mentor. I understand the importance of keeping students engaged and showing up for school. But JROTC is not the way to fix these problems. There is no tangible evidence that JROTC motivates students to stay in school. If that were true, then why, according.

C: Sylvia Hart Mansford thank you. I just want to speak from my heart to some of the points on the table and I will start with violence. The military needs to help the schools of course learn and students learn about national defense. But to invite in a program that's not an extracurricular program nor is it an academic program as a replacement for sound curricula, pedagogy and career guidance isn't the route to go. Students need to learn about fighting and how humans build groups and nations, how they use politics and power and how they struggle and strive in the context of other lessons. Now, all of our lessons pull things out of concept context. But this military focus for a whole course, quietly, not always tacitly for a specific portion of our student population isn't wise for them. It's making a choice for them very quietly. And that's not something that we need to do. I think that there are deficits in our schools and if certain Segments of the population or our people, generally speaking, are suffering from these deficits. They should be directly addressed, not through a program that avoids helping people with their scholastic problems. So I've addressed violence. I've talked about the school deficit, and I'd like to talk a little bit about careers and heroism because we talk to students at our tables in the schools and have for years, and they want to be heroes. Quite a number of them are interested in the military tables because they want to serve their country and they care about people and they want a path to follow with a good career. Do we back up to one narrow kind of education as an excuse for not providing that in our other programs? I loved your word trade off, and I call that an opportunity cost. The energy, the passion that we put into bringing JROTC into our schools, if we go that route, could be much more effectively used on other parts of our schooling. Is J ROTC all bad? No. But could we get more bang for our buck if we stayed away from that kind of narrow training? I think we could. Thank you. Oh, I just want to say one more thing about leadership. Yes, we need to teach leadership, but in that context, it's very skinny kind of leadership. We need to talk about leadership in nurturing careers, healing careers, artistic careers, investigation, inquiry, creating, and in national defense. But to backtrack with a whole offering saying, oh, well, we need students to make the choice. We have so many choices. We don't offer our students that going to the military for one of them as our first place to go, it doesn't hold water. It's not rational. And our experience in other realms of education shows us that that's not where you improve education.

G: I'Ve been following this conversation for a number of months, and I want to put out my bona fides, if I might. As far as I went to Peninsula Elementary School, Chief Joseph Oakley Green, and then I managed to get to Adams High School, I had some of the most wonderful teachers you could possibly imagine. The majority of my teachers have master's degrees or better. A lot of them were doctorates. A lot of them were out of Princeton, Harvard, Brown. These were educated people, and they came here specifically to teach at Adams, which was a novel concept. But for me, I was raised in Northeast Portland, and I'm the guy that the Director Green's talking about. I'm the guy that didn't connect. I had the best staff that you could possibly get me, and I just couldn't keep up with them because they were so Far above and beyond where I was at in Northeast Portland with trying to make money and stay out of trouble. But I didn't have any role models. So my role model, which is interesting, I'm a history statement, by the way, and I really want to talk about this gentleman for the building that we're meeting in right now. This gentleman needs to be talked about even more.

B: Dr. Profit.

start time: 1043:31:52.000

confidence: 0.96
G: Because Dr. Profit was raised in Mississippi. He was picking cotton. His parents said, heck, no, you're not doing that. They found the money to send him to school, but he couldn't finish college for whatever reason through the articles. And I talked to the Oregonian writer that put this article together, and she's going to give me the background on all this because she. She related to me about this article. Dr. Proford Profit was in a. He was brought in on the draft. He went to Korea nine months after he was in. He was a sergeant in the United States Army. I'm a retired master sergeant. That means something to me. This guy is on the ball. Then when he got back, instead of getting out, he stayed in the Army. He put himself through night school. He got a commission as a second lieutenant. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He's been awarded numerous valor medals and Purple Heart. He served in Vietnam. He came back here and was our district person, our superintendent for 10 years. He was that guy that everybody got along with. He was such that guy. He attributed a lot of that to what he learned in the military. It's not for everybody. I know some people are going to go to Santa Cruz, UC Santa Cruz. Some people are going to be over at the law school at Lewis and Clark. I get that. But for a lot of people like myself, we don't have the role models to watch to go into your school system and do well. I did go through the Marine Corps 26 years. But it was a gentleman, my career counselor, that said, you know, you're going to get suspended. You might want to talk to the military. I had no intentions of joining the military. I had no affiliation for the military. That is not what I was thinking at all. I was thinking, I'm about ready to get suspended for school, for skipping, among other things. So I met a recruiter. The recruiter was in my School in 1977. He remembered my name. He said something to me later, after I managed to get suspended from school and I joined the Marines, I'm gone in San Diego. My three years is up. I stayed. I go through 26 years in the Marine Corps. I retire. I Come back home. I've served in combat in Iraq, and I. I recognize that some of what you say up here, I've had different opinions and I have different experiences. I don't devalue what you have to say. I respect it. But my experience is much different. I was a northeast kid that went through a lot of schools that couldn't graduate. But I'm told that I am the newest high school graduate of Portland Public school schools. This was dated October of last year or this year, October. And it signed off because I found out that there was a law that was passed that said that if you left school, join the military, got an honorable diploma, and you came back, you could submit for this. And I thought it was a joke. I called. I called the lady that she got my high school diploma transcripts, put everything together, and three weeks later, I had a high school diploma from Portland, Oregon. I can't tell you how proud of this I am. And when I came back out of the Marine Corps, when I retired, I went straight to Portland State University for four years and have a bachelor's degree in business administration. My oldest daughter's graduated out of University of Oregon with a business degree. I have. My middle daughter is at U of O right now as a junior. I've got another one slated to go to Oregon State. All of those things would have never happened. Unless, again, it's not for everybody, but for me and people like me. I had an opportunity to gain traction by being surrounded by people who could say, not like this, but like this. And they showed me the value of education. I came home and I used my VA loan to purchase a home. And I just want to say there's so much good in Portland and I know that you can make a difference with it, and I thank you for that. And we have a history with the military. It disappeared for a long time, but I'm a history statement to say it worked once and I believe it can work again.

end time: 1182:45:20.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yes, yes. I just want. I've been listening to this on, on the streaming station, but I just wanted to kind of just look at, you know, when we talk about the ROTC program, you know, I think when we really look at the programs as a whole, I mean, we know there's a lot of positive that goes with this, right? We talk about leadership development we talk about character building, we talk about community service that many ROTC programs is involved in in their communities. When we look at career explorations, you know, when you look at the different career tracks, you know, I think we have to look at how do we get away from looking at it as just a war tying organization and also look at the career explorations that kids can get out of that as well, from doctors, lawyers, social workers, teachers, all of those comes out of, that could potentially come out of the JROTC programs. You know, and so I wouldn't necessarily want to look at this as what negative that could come out of this, but let's look at what positive that could come out of this. You know, let's look at, you know, when we look at the impact on our student outcomes. Right. You know, the RAND Corporation had a, a survey done just as 2023 happened. And it talked about those that join ROTC programs, attendance rates increased. Right. Those that joined the program academically fared off better. And it even talked about those that started the program and dropped out in the first year, how worse off they was than those that stayed. So while I, I hear everybody side on, you know, whether we should or shouldn't do this, I just wouldn't have everybody just kind of focus on what is the possibilities, what is the benefits, not for our own understanding as adults, but for our kids. You know, those kids that would never, wouldn't necessarily be able to go to college because of the funding that they don't have and can this provide them a way for funding? When we talk about generational wealth, you know, being able to come out of the military and use the GI Bill to buy your house to start generational wealth with your families. Let's look at the positive that could come out versus why we shouldn't do it. And I think we should just kind of look at why we should and what we can benefit, not us as adults, but what our kids can benefit. And we can just keep our focus on kids. I think then we can look at kids coming out of high school should have multiple opportunities. They should have multiple ways to go. It shouldn't just be college. It shouldn't just be career technical stuff. It shouldn't just be, you know, one way or the other. They should have multiple options when they come out. And I think this is just one options of many that we have in our schools today. And this could be one option that we add to our tool belt, you know, when and when a worker, you know, and I'm real big CTE fan. When a worker has a 2 belt, he has multiple tools in his tool belt. He don't just have one or two. He have multiple. Because he doesn't ever necessarily know what he's going to need when he come up to a problem or solution. And this is all we're saying is jr JROTC could just be another tool in their toolbox. And that's all I have to say about that. Thank you.

But before we kind of continue, I don't know, Sarah Miles, if you're still with us over there. Jj, one of the. One of the things I want to mention about Student Success Committee is that, you know, this is about the students, right. So I sent an email out to you three earlier today. I'm sorry, it was kind of late, so, you know, have to answer today. But one of the things I do would like is if our student reps also kind of help set what kind of agenda items you want to discuss and talk about. One of the things that the student success committee, obviously in the name, right. It's about what will help our students succeed. But it we serve, kind of the way I see it, this community kind of serves like three, right. One is kind of an oversight to kind of see what programs are going in, what they're doing for our kids, and kind of reviewing if they're showing success or not. Right. Hopefully showing success. The other one, the other potential is like, for example, you just notice sometimes there's Action ID where we have something we might explore or implement or if there's something like we might in a very rare chance think of maybe a policy direction or something that we want to send to the board. Those are also options as well. With that said, if anyone has any questions, we would like to move on to the graduation requirements.

If you threw on a have ideas you want to throw out there or you can always just email me later or do it next time. There's no timeline except this year. Great for graduation requirements. Just kind of introduce a little bit. We started looking at graduation requirements as part of there's always that conundrum where you want graduation requirements to say something, to mean something, to show rigor to to. But at the same time you don't want it to be inaccessible or reduce for example graduation rates because they may be unattainable for certain pathways. And so one of the things that we talk about in graduation requirements is how do we continue to have high expectations but without cutting people off? I don't know. That's kind of over simplistic and I really butchered it. So I'm sorry I didn't have enough coffee today, but I don't. I think there's a presentation right. So I think we can start with that and then have questions come after. Sure.

start time: 1257:15:40.000
end time: 1328:11:00.000
confidence: 0.96
F: I know we're short on time, so I'll just provide a quick overview. Wanted to make sure that the committee was aware of a new set of graduation requirements as part of Senate Bill 3, which passed last spring. This bill establishes that class of 2027. So this is current ninth graders. Students who are currently enrolled in ninth grade will be required to complete a half a credit of personal finance and half a credit of higher education and Career Path Skills as part of their 24 for credit graduation requirement. We can go to the next two slides, provide a bit more information about these two requirements. You can see the Career Path Skills calls for schools to ensure that schools are providing instruction on how to apply for jobs, how to apply for admissions, to post secondary institutions, support students towards developing career related skills, etcetera and then the following slide talks a little bit more about personal financial education and what that should include, namely education around credit scores, investment strategies for creating a budget, taxes, building, financial well being, etc. As far as the logistics are concerned, the following slide. We understandably are wanting to make sure that our current 9th graders have these new graduation requirements incorporated in their graduation plans. But unfortunately, the state or odes yet to release the actual standards and information about licensure requirements. So they are in the process right now of convening panels which will develop those standards and determine if there are any specific licensure requirements. You can imagine that if we had to hire teachers who have special licensure to teach financial literacy across our high schools and across the state, that would probably be untenable. But nonetheless, we're waiting for ODE to provide more information. That information should be available this spring, which means that next school year would be the year that we are then building out what will most likely be these new courses which would then be available to students the following school year. So our current 9th graders will probably have to wait until junior year before they can actually begin working towards completing these graduation requirements. The good news is that all of our high schools already offer a course called College and Career Education, which appears at least to align with one set of these requirements. I did have a conversation with somebody from OD to say to see if we could retroactively award credit, and the answer was yes. So that's, that's good. And so our hope is to, you know, watch closely. We can go to next slide to see when the standards are finalized. We're in the process of auditing our courses to see what courses do we already offer that may be aligned with some of these new expectations. And then we'll be most likely adding, creating new courses during the 2425 school year to add to the district course catalog and making those available for students in 24, 526. So that's a little bit about SB3. Any questions there?

And what we're saying now is we have to wait until we get more information from the state. So at this point, there really isn't anything that students could do to fulfill these requirements other than to continue, you know, going to class and do well in the classes that you're taking. But we're hoping that next school year we will be sharing a lot more information with students and families to say this bill was passed. Here is what the state decided are the standards. Here's what that means for you so that nobody's surprised.

I've heard from a number of students and my own children like, you know, we need some more financial literacy. How do we make decisions about a variety of things as we're either working for the first time and or planning for post secondary. So I think there's an opportunity to both get a sense of interest in what are the topics and then is that something that we can align with the standards and try to produce that and do it in both directions?

B: Like. Oh, yeah. I mean, I guess it depends on when we get the curriculum. But you know, usually they like assign social studies teachers or something to do. That's right. So I guess the. My. I guess clarifying questions are typical. If that does happen that way. Right. It's probably. There's probably a route where teachers can get certified over summer, you know, using their professional development stipends and stuff like that.

start time: 1380:40:50.000

A: Or.

start time: 1380:44:50.000
end time: 1397:36:22.000
confidence: 0.94
C: And how is that fitting into the credit requirements that we're looking at? Which is. It's part of parcel of this whole conversation. Right. So this, this is a, you know, is it something that becomes formalized and then is, you know, is this, is it a line specific line, a graduation on a diploma or whatnot. So I think some of those details will have to be sorted out in the coming year. Yeah. Like would it mean maybe you couldn't take that art class you want because you have to take this? Well, it could mean that instead of. So you know, it could mean like they're 24. It's part of the 24 graduation requirements. So they haven't expanded the total number of credits to graduate. They change the mix of what's required and then our high school students have an opportunity to earn potentially up to 32 credits. So it may not be the trade off but it may be that you have to. Of the 24, you have to have this explicitly instead of it being in a like a category for social studies.

end time: 1401:49:44.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was going to be my question. Like is this replacing something or is it adding on top? It sounds like it's. Sounds like it's replacing. Right.

start time: 1401:51:12.000
end time: 1412:33:06.000
confidence: 0.92
C: And then in the Oregon in the Oregon diploma and then PPS diploma is slightly different. Right. Because we. Our graduation requirements include world language on top. So it's. We have more credits that students have to complete complete in a. Well, we have a different mix of credits. So the total bucket may still be the same but what is. What is going into that bucket may be different and students. Again 24 credits is the minimum requirements. Right. So we're expecting students to explore at a richer level. 24 is not what we're aiming for. We're aiming for beyond 24.

H: I was just gonna say also with the like I looked over the new graduation requirements like what was in the slideshow and with like the replacing. I'd be a little bit concerned with like Lincoln, for example, as a full IB school and I'm also a full IB student. So there's like certain requirements for that. So like how would that affect the diplomas like that. And like would it take away from being able to do something? I don't know.

end time: 1455:46:38.000
confidence: 0.92
G: And ode what they're doing is right is they're working through some of these pieces now. And that's definitely going to be. Because it is going to affect our juniors around. I'm assuming that they're going to have. Because we're not. We don't. We're not the only district that has IP schools.

confidence: 0.94
B: Anything else? I just want to. The reason I want to kind of end this really quick so we'll save equitable grading practice for next time. That's a big one. But I also want to open up to our students and kind of pry any. You have any ideas you might have for what you want to see this. This committee kind of explore or talk about or what directions that you're thinking of what needs you see today.

start time: 1471:35:40.000

end time: 1500:13:30.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah. I'll start off. So I think would be. I don't know if this committee would do. I'm not too sure but I think it would be cool to see how. Because I feel like oftentimes students have a hard time like navigating the district. Like who do I go to or like, you know, they go to like departments page and there's like so many roles. So I think it'd be really interesting to See if we can. How we can find avenues for navigators for students, like, who to contact. Like, do I contact, like, the head of department or do I contact someone maybe, like, lower down the food chain or whatever, the chain of command. And, you know, I did talk to students about the program that we were talking about, and I heard some students say how they think that's a really good program, but what they would like to see is like a cosmetology class. You know, I think especially for our black and brown students who have to be our underserved students, I think that is really going to be beneficial because, you know, I hear tons of conversations like, oh, I would love to learn how to braid hair. I would love to learn how to do nails. And if our district could provide that for students, I really see that boosting in the attendance because that's something they're truly passionate about. And kind of layering that with like, you know, maybe it's. I know Benson has their, like, medical program and they connected with like, nursing departments and hospitals. Like, maybe, you know, we could connect them with, you know, cosmetologists, like, businesses and all that and like, local businesses. And I really think if I don't know who could look into that or could get me more data or information on that, but I really think that would be really helpful for students.

H: Adding on to jj, I know the DSC discussed last meeting, like, having some sort of, like, district directory that, like, students could have availability. Availability to. Because, like, for me personally, like, before joining dsc, I had like, no idea about anything that went on the district and, like, how anything worked. And so I think just in general, like, being more. Finding ways to be more transparent or, like, include more student voices and outreach and input into like, all the decisions that we take as a district is just beneficial since it is impacting, like, the students the most. I feel like off the top of my head, I don't have, like, any major ideas, but I'm willing to think of them and then let them, let you guys know about them in the future.

start time: 1515:52:10.000
end time: 1521:26:30.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Thank you. Like that both of you mentioned, like, a district directory. Is is there an example of the. Of the situation or a need that happened once that you could give that kind of helps illustrate where the confusion and where that may help, maybe.

E: Well, I think, for example, I know we've had this conversation with Margaret and I, my student council did, but, you know, sometimes, you know, we had like, topic of like lunchtime, how to extend it. I think, you know, and I know some tons of Students try to reach out to, like, tons of people in the district, but we just, like, little bit hard for them to, like, navigate, like, who's the right person? You know, I know some of y'all have really, like, busy schedules and all that, and it's, like, hard to, like, answer emails, but if there's, like, some sort of person, like, students could go to or, like, some. So I know there's like, the. What's it called? There's like, some sort of, like, page. Yeah, let's Talk feature. I think that's a really good thing. But I did hear from students that it takes a long time to get a response. So if there's just a way students could get, like, you know, obviously get their answer question, but in that more of a timely matter, I think that would be really helpful.

end time: 1543:07:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yeah, there still is, but I think the students aren't really using it because I know not too many students, you know, really go on, like people in space. Just a little bit hard to kind of find. But I think just looking at different ways, how can we kind of promote it, you know, whether. I think social media is, like, obviously a really great way of engaging with students. I think just looking into more things like that.

D: Yeah. I was listening to the students speak, and I think, you know, it would be great. You know, just. Just an idea. I'm just throwing ideas as I hear them speak. May we have, like, a student liaison department or something where students have a direct connect with, you know, a department that's directly for students. Just a thought.

E: And, you know, I know, like, tons of district staff and our leaders do, like, evaluate, but what I've heard from students is, like, we want to see you, like, more involved in our community. You know, we want to see you at our assemblies. You know, we want to see you at, you know, our talent shows. And I think if we could, you know, see more of our district leaders and, you know, I think post about that on, like, you know, obviously our, like, PPS instrument, because I feel like you're now in the world in a generation where it's like, if it isn't online, it kind of didn't happen. So I think it would be cool to just see you guys more at our events. You know, I know, maybe McDaniel at December 13th, we're hosting a winter craft fair where we're having tons of students and affinity groups, you know, selling craft, and it's a way they can, like, show our community and make profit from that. You know, it's at McDaniels from 3:30 to 5:30. So if you're able to come, that would be amazing.
