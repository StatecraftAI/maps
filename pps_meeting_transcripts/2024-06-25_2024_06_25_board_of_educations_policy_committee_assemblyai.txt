A: Okay, we're gonna go ahead and call the meeting into order. We'll start with opening with the policy committee meeting. We have a couple policies on our agenda for consideration. And I'm gonna start with introductions. We'll just do the dais and we'll start with Ann. Kara, why don't you star Kara? Kara Bradshaw, executive assistant.

A: Julia Brim Edwards, board member, committee member, committee chair. And we have a student rep on the committee, Frankie Silverstein. She unfortunately is not able to attend today, but she did send, send some comments on the policy and I will Forward them to Ms. Bradshaw. So everyone, maybe you can circulate them to the group or were you copied on it? Okay, I'll forward them to you and if you could send it to the group and maybe we'll discuss it when we get to that policy. So the first policy. Let's see. Before we get to policies, we have public comments. And I'm going to give people the choice who signed up for public comment. You can either comment at the very beginning or if you want to comment, which is how we have it on the agenda, or if you want to comment right before we consider a policy. I'm also open to that. Do you want to go ahead and Ms. Bradshaw and just say who signed up for public comment and people can tell us whether they want to do it now or adjacent to the item? Yes. Leah Starr, Kerry Zambrano, Jamie Homburg and Jessica Colby. So anybody who was called, would you, would you like to go now? Okay, I see no from Jessica. Anybody else who's here to testify, want to come now or do you want to go later? So we've got everybody going later. Okay, great. Thank you for your cooperation. I didn't want to make you wait. But also, sometimes it's more relevant to get it married with the agenda item. So the first agenda item is field trips, foreign travel, and other off campus activities. And these are policies for discussion and potential action. And was anybody signed up to talk about speak on this topic? Okay. No. Perfect. All right, so in our agenda items, we, in our materials, we have two documents. One is the version that we discussed at the last meeting. And this was put forward initially by Director Wong, and then we've had several committee discussions and also some revisions from the original document. And there's a second document which are some proposed staff amendments. And I think we should just walk through those just line item by line item, and then if we're agreeable to them, we can then just adopt them as a package. Into the. Into the policy that works. Yes. And you'll see that there's additional flexibility. Is red lined out. That should be the version you're looking at. This is the staff amendment package. Liz, do you want to walk through these or do you have somebody else you want to.

C: I'm happy to walk through them. Many of them were just tweaks to language and not substance. Just tightening some of the language. So one of the things I will point out though in the first paragraph is we talked about extended travel as being a term that may not be readily interpreted consistently and could mean different things. And I know we talked about 14 time zones versus not. We just said overseas travel just as a way to. And those are long trips anyway, given that we live in Oregon, unless they're going to Canada. So we thought that that was. And I think overseas actually as I'm sitting means international in that context and maybe that needs to be changed. But instead we looked at different ways to articulate a big long trip that has a lot of travel time and came up with something fairly simple and then set out. Tried to again just tighten the language around the receipt restrictions. Again, I don't think there is significant substantive change. It's mostly language with maybe one exception in two exceptions in C and D. In C, there's the addition of the principal supervisor has to approve the plan for the students who are remaining and not going on the trip or the impact of the school. And the. I think there is an open question on the number of days. So it didn't get changed in here. But there is significant staff concern about 15 school days, including concerns about a 10 day. If that means a 10 day drop, I don't know if that got resolved. I'm not sure that it does, but that was one question. But also when you think about students and a DLI program attending non DLI classes at the middle school level, the things that aren't in that program, they will be absent from those three full school weeks would be a long time. So I think. And I don't know if Lorna. Lorna's looking at me like no, I can report the concerns. Seven days, 10 days, I think is more in the range. What was being sought within the caveat that the superintendent may approve longer if the particular trip needed it. But to set the expectation that it is certainly no more than 10 days. And I think some preferences on the academic side were for seven.

start time: 119:29:10.000
end time: 120:23:26.000
confidence: 0.93
B: So is that seven days out of school?

start time: 120:24:38.000
end time: 121:06:06.000
confidence: 0.83
C: School days okay, School days, yes.

start time: 121:09:18.000
end time: 122:22:16.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And then 10 days maximum no, be seven days. Seven school days.

start time: 122:23:28.000
end time: 123:54:16.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Seven school days. So trying to maximize other holidays, weekends.

start time: 123:56:08.000
end time: 124:00:56.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Yes.

start time: 124:01:28.000
end time: 128:54:32.000
confidence: 0.96
C: But I think there was consensus that more than 10 was really causing a lot of concern about the impact of being gone that long again, with a kick out to the superintendent. If the program required 11 because of travel and tickets or part of the school experience abroad, but they were very.

start time: 128:54:56.000
end time: 136:01:22.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Concerned about 15, would it be. I guess my question for that part was, would it be possible to do the policy without mentioning maximum or minimum? Say, like. Say like, allowable travel time shall be a standard of 10 days. And that way it allows flexibility. Because what I'm worried about with the language of maximum. Right. If you say, oh, maximum of 10 days, then, you know, what's to stop someone saying, hey, you can only go for three days?

start time: 136:03:06.000
end time: 136:12:18.000
confidence: 0.55
C: Does the policy.

start time: 136:13:14.000
end time: 140:24:20.000
confidence: 0.92
D: It's maximum. Right. So I guess if we say something like, with a. Yeah. I mean, would. Would it sound okay or work okay if it said the standard of allowable travel time shall be 10 school days?

start time: 140:29:20.000
end time: 142:09:12.000
confidence: 0.95
C: And then I worry that standard means it needs to be 10 days, and it means it may be eight or.

start time: 142:09:36.000
end time: 142:39:40.000
confidence: 0.97
E: It might be standard allowable.

start time: 143:25:30.000
end time: 148:49:54.000
confidence: 0.90
C: I think we're trying to say the same. I mean, we're trying to get to the same place. So you can. If maximum is causing the problem, we can. We can wordsmith that. I think we want it. Maybe it's just allowable. Is that instead of maximum, does that address your concern?

start time: 148:52:42.000
end time: 153:56:56.000
confidence: 0.94
D: I think so. I mean, I think the key here is that. I mean, I really like the idea that the superintendent can prove longer for exceptions and things that. I think the point with the word allowable instead of maximum, is that allowable or just the standard amount?

start time: 153:58:48.000
end time: 156:39:36.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Just take out. So it says if these conditions are met, the standard allowable travel time shall be. And then just take out maximum in just 10 days.

start time: 156:40:48.000
end time: 156:51:40.000
confidence: 0.83
F: Yeah.

start time: 157:05:20.000
end time: 157:38:22.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So it's allowable 10 days.

start time: 157:40:56.000
end time: 161:40:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: The flexibility. The best academic practice is to be gone no more than 10 days. But we want the flexibility in case it's 10 and a half or 11 or 12. Yeah, I'm happy with that.

start time: 162:10:50.000
end time: 166:57:20.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So a question I would have. Is it clear that C and the. I'm sorry, D is linked to these odds overseas trips or is it about field trips generally?

start time: 167:00:00.000
end time: 167:23:00.000
confidence: 0.89
C: Well, I think it's.

start time: 167:42:00.000
end time: 167:53:36.000

C: These are subsets.

start time: 168:06:56.000
end time: 169:08:16.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Something kind of funky about the. There's like zero. Zero.

start time: 169:10:48.000
end time: 170:44:48.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Well, but there's a colon at the top of this. Again, this is a. This is a segment of the full policy.

start time: 170:47:04.000
end time: 171:00:32.000
confidence: 0.61
A: So that's what.

start time: 171:02:16.000
end time: 171:20:16.000
confidence: 0.91
C: So those are a subset.

start time: 171:20:48.000
end time: 171:23:28.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Yeah.

start time: 171:23:44.000
end time: 171:40:00.000
confidence: 0.87
C: That's what they're calling.

start time: 171:41:20.000
end time: 171:45:36.000
confidence: 0.52
D: Yeah.

start time: 171:46:08.000
end time: 172:25:56.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So this is like a sub subset of field trips.

start time: 172:27:48.000
end time: 172:34:44.000
confidence: 0.82
C: Right.

start time: 172:36:12.000
end time: 177:49:24.000
confidence: 0.93
D: So this is supposed to be under two, the district staff. So when we copy and pasted it, the word document resetted all the numbers and bullets. So it's P under two, district staff responsible. And then this is an addition to it, version A where it says zero is supposed to be two and then A, B, C, D are under two.

start time: 177:50:52.000
end time: 178:42:12.000
confidence: 0.61
A: Okay, it's formatting. Yeah.

start time: 178:43:16.000
end time: 178:54:00.000
confidence: 0.58
D: Yeah.

start time: 179:43:50.000
end time: 184:09:02.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Okay. So it would very clearly apply to all these things and then 10 days. And the suggestion is that we'd be striking the words a maximum of and then changing 15 to 10.

start time: 184:10:46.000
end time: 184:44:50.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yes, that's what I understood.

start time: 185:02:30.000
end time: 185:23:42.000
confidence: 0.86
D: Does that sound okay to you?

start time: 185:25:26.000
end time: 185:36:30.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Yes.

start time: 185:39:10.000
end time: 188:23:02.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Okay. Also just keep in mind that the current ad that we have says five days school days, but up to 20 days under exceptional circumstances.

start time: 188:24:06.000
end time: 189:04:54.000
confidence: 0.86
F: So it's just the ad would probably.

start time: 189:05:42.000
end time: 189:42:30.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Be amended in light when this policy is adopted.

start time: 189:43:50.000
end time: 190:23:02.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So the AD follows the right.

start time: 190:23:26.000
end time: 191:23:50.000
confidence: 0.97
D: But just kind of giving you an idea of like the historical range that we currently have.

start time: 191:24:30.000
end time: 219:31:38.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I don't know that anybody. I've never heard of a 20 day field trip or travel. I mean there used to be a separate policy around like, or maybe this still exists around foreign exchanges. But I can't recall in 20 years ever saying a trip was 20 days. I don't recall that. Okay, great. Thank you for the wordsmithing there. I'm supportive of the other changes and including the one instead of just sharing it with the principals, but also being approved by the principal supervisors. And the reason I say that is I appreciate. So thanks to staff who put together the chart that had the information about who goes on the trip. I mean just to summarize, in general, it's really not staff outside dli, it's just DLI staff. So that's a good checkpoint. So that was one thing they're concerned. And then does an administrator attend and all of these say yes, that there's an administrator. Which is why it's probably just good practice and good governance not to having an administrator approving the their own plans. If they weren't going, I could see, if there wasn't an administrator going, I could see like they could have final approval. But since an administrator is going, they'd be approving their own plans.

start time: 219:33:14.000
end time: 220:25:50.000
confidence: 0.89
B: So who would be approving the administrators?

start time: 220:34:10.000
end time: 239:31:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: The principal supervisor. It's in, I mean I saw the language, it's in C. So the plans made minimize impacts have been improved by the school principal and the principal supervisor. It just changes. It from being shared with the principal supervisor to being approved it. Also, the data I thought was really interesting to get on the attendance of the trips. And anytime you have almost 100% participation shows an inclusive practice. Are there any other questions about the staff amendments other than the changes we just made? So I'm going to suggest, and since we operate more informally at the committee level, that we move the changes. Let me ask one last one. Do we want to change overseas to international? That would be on version A, the third line.

start time: 239:44:30.000
end time: 241:46:46.000
confidence: 0.98
C: I recommend that while you're in it, I mean, I think I wrote overseas, and as I was listening to myself explain it, I thought international was a better word.

start time: 241:47:18.000
end time: 242:18:50.000
confidence: 0.55
D: So excludes Hawaii.

start time: 243:11:10.000
end time: 244:15:06.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Well, international would not exclude Mexico. We're going to.

start time: 244:17:28.000
end time: 258:24:34.000
confidence: 0.93
A: The two changes that we're going to make to the staff amendment is changing the word overseas, swapping in international, and then we're going to be in D, dropping the words a maximum of. And then we're going to be changing 15 to 10. Everybody on the committee good with that? Yes, Patty, I know when you show up, you get to share an opinion. And. Okay, so we've made those changes to the staff amendment. And then is everybody agreeable of moving all the staff amendment, as amended, into the base document?

start time: 258:26:32.000
end time: 258:37:50.000
confidence: 0.53
B: Yes.

start time: 258:40:30.000
end time: 258:52:50.000
confidence: 0.88
D: Yes.

start time: 259:58:30.000
end time: 262:41:34.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So with that, I'd like to move it out of committee for a first reading. Does everybody recommend to the board to have a first reading? Okay.

start time: 262:42:22.000
end time: 262:50:54.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Yes.

start time: 262:53:02.000
end time: 269:10:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: All right. Thank you, everybody, for your work on that and to staff for getting the data. I think that was one thing I like to do. If you want to put this in a format that's somewhat informal for the community's use, but somehow put it in some sort of format or maybe it's the staff incorporated in the staff report.

start time: 269:36:50.000
end time: 270:20:58.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yes, we can. We'll figure out how to do that.

start time: 270:23:14.000
end time: 271:51:54.000
confidence: 0.96
A: It's great data, and I think it's good to be sharing as we're my.

start time: 271:52:02.000
end time: 273:05:54.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Deer in the headlights, because I did not create the data. So I will find the people who, to make sure we did incorporate.

start time: 273:06:42.000
end time: 288:59:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I just wanted not to say, like, oh, we're just going to put this out there because it looks like it might be more informally presented. Okay, great. So the next policy under consideration is promotion and retention of students, which is being renamed acceleration and retention of students. It's 4.2 0.10. And this was a policy that staff asked us to change. Kara, do we have anybody that want to testify on this? No. Okay. I had a question for staff. Is my version of it that I printed out on the third Page under acceleration E, it says add here at the end of the sentence.

start time: 290:44:40.000
end time: 291:47:00.000
confidence: 0.99
C: I'm sorry, I can't speak to that. I don't know what was meant.

start time: 292:15:20.000
end time: 293:07:40.000
confidence: 0.87
B: It looks like someone's planning on adding something.

start time: 293:24:40.000
end time: 295:58:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So if a student is recommended for whole grade deceleration, the principal must inform the supervisor and ensure that a personalized learning plan has been developed and shared to the family. That includes.

start time: 296:13:30.000
end time: 297:38:42.000
confidence: 0.94
C: There's clearly some missing text there and we'll have to take it back to the academic team to have them address it.

start time: 297:39:06.000
end time: 303:39:24.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I'm sorry, the question I would ask about that is shared with the family. Should the sentence just end there and the recitation of what actually goes into that be like in the ad or not actually in the policy? Because it seems like that might be overly detailed Anyway.

start time: 303:41:32.000
end time: 304:21:20.000
confidence: 0.89
C: I think that's a divine solution.

start time: 304:28:20.000
end time: 306:14:40.000
confidence: 0.89
D: Yeah, that's what I was going to suggest too, because it already instructs that the ad would be implemented.

start time: 306:21:40.000
end time: 319:17:02.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So that was the other thing I was going to suggest is that we actually strike that sentence because the moment we pass it and they develop an ad, it's like we don't need it in the policy. So the expectation is if we pass a. If we pass the policy, they'll develop an administrative directive. So I would suggest we strike the language in E, which it says that includes the colon, and that also we strike. The superintendent should develop administrative directives to implement the policies. Everybody okay with that? Yep. Okay. Is there anything else? We've had this. I think this is the second time before. So is there anything else that anybody has any comments on?

A: Are we okay with recommending a first reading? Okay, so another one we'll send out for first reading. Our third policy is 6.1 0.100 high school credit earned prior to ninth grade. And this is a policy that we've had before us for a couple meetings. And I think I'd like to start with. We have some public comment on it.

E: Hi, my name is Jessica Colby. J E S S I C A C O L B Y she her. I am the current TAG act chair. That's the talented and Gifted Advisory Council and have been advocating for the many needs of students in PPS for nearly 10 years. I'm here today to express our appreciation, Tacac's appreciation that the proposed revision of policy for the high school credit earned prior to ninth grade grants students the right to have their work acknowledged and accounted for. We are, however, worried about the administrative directive that will align with this policy. Our goal is to ensure that students who have completed accelerated coursework will be able to move to the next level without barriers. A transparent and streamlined system is key in supporting all students who have accelerated their curriculum. We hope that you will include us in your community outreach when developing these directives as we have a window into these issues that PPS currently does not. Additionally, we are disappointed that we received no response to our email from either staff or board members, no notification that our email would be included as material in today's agenda, or even that this meeting was happening today. This lack of communication is not collaborative, respectful, or student centered. And we expect PPS to walk the.

I'm as interested you. Your submitted testimony is a little bit different than what you offered today. Yes, that was our response to the meeting and then we were happy to see what the changes were. And my testimony today is to just say thank you because obviously that was looked at and also we have concerns. Just keep an eye on things because the administrative. Administrative directive coming after is important. And also it would have been lovely to have gotten a heads up. Thank you for your comments and for the clarification that you feel like your initial set of comments actually got incorporated even though you weren't acknowledged. So apologies. Okay, so. And I'm gonna actually raise some of the issues that were raised in your initial testimony because I thought there were some good points. So we have a document and I list you on to walk through the have.

F: I have some summary comments and then I'm happy to answer any questions. And. And I will just say that before I start, I was also addressed in the TAG ACT letter, but I did not receive it until I saw it in the board book. So just want to kind of state that for the record. So. Good afternoon. The last time that Dr. Arishtek and I came before the policy committee, it became clear that we had some work to do on the high school credit before 9th grade policy. Many of your questions led us to taking several steps back and to recommend changes to the policy itself. If these or other changes are adopted by the committee and the board, we would then begin the process of revising the administrative directive to better align with the policy and would request that. Would request to bring that before you at a later date. So our first recommendation is that the policy identify the superintendent or her designee as the person who can designate which courses are available for high school credit. There's been kind of a tradition of only mathematics and world language being the courses considered, but that wasn't spelled out, so we would defer to the superintendent on that. We've included or maintained language that the courses approved by the superintendent should be standards based with equivalent content and instructors who are licensed by the state to teach this content. Other aspects of the courses approved for high school credit should be equivalent to what is found in high schools and in terms of their content statements, goals and syllabi, their textbooks and instructional materials, time allocation and facilities. We recommend that students also earn a grade of C or higher to earn the high school credit. We maintain the policy's original language that states that pre 9th grade credit should not compel students to graduate early and added language that this policy should allow students to take more accelerated or advanced courses such as international baccalaureate, AP and dual credit during high school. We also included language that states that high school courses taken outside of PPS should be reviewed and approved by the superintendent or her designee before credit is awarded. And finally, we did review the thoughtful commentary submitted by the TAG advisory council. And we would be happy to meet with this group in the new school year to ensure that their concerns are addressed in the administrative directive.

start time: 459:03:40.000
end time: 467:16:10.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So it's been kind of the current practice, which is not stated anywhere, but has been just kind of tradition has been world language and mathematics. We really are not. We haven't done a kind of comprehensive review to be able to say what would be appropriate or not what we would recommend to the superintendent. And we don't know kind of where she stands on this evening either.

B: Okay. So as long, I mean, you've put the guardrails in place at least to have the discussion.

confidence: 0.95

H: When you say world language, what exactly does that mean? Is that language arts or is it foreign language?

start time: 477:35:20.000
end time: 484:24:20.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So it's also known as foreign language, but you know, it's a little more inclusive language to say world language. So typically Spanish, Mandarin, are there ones that are accessible in middle school coming, you know, eventually with Vietnamese, other languages in our DLI programs.

start time: 484:34:00.000
end time: 486:23:44.000
confidence: 0.91
H: Okay, so then it excluded like language arts classes.

start time: 486:24:32.000
end time: 499:08:20.000
confidence: 0.95
F: That would accelerate it, correct? Yeah. We have not had a practice of, of students taking a course in middle school, a language arts course for high school credit for a number of reasons. Partly because we require four years of language arts only in high school. And so we've seen that as a four year requirement is kind of the first reason. The second reason we talked about in the prior meeting that it's part of our ninth grade teams, based on our Measure 98 work, which is informed by the University of Chicago research around ninth grade, on track, trying to keep somebody.

start time: 499:11:00.000

H: Okay, thank you.

start time: 500:31:40.000
end time: 532:07:32.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So I appreciate the considerations given. I still feel that it's. There's some subjectivity in it or like just. It would be very hard, I think, putting my parent hat on and having had three kids in high school who took classes at PCC Summer Scholars whole. They took world languages in middle school, they took math in middle school. So I'm just going to view it through that lens. And so to me, I couldn't read this and know which one of those courses actually required. And to think that just from a practical standpoint, you would want to know before the student took the class whether it's going to count for credit. So I'm thinking it's a rather clunky process to going to submit something like, is my PCC? You know, I forget the numbers, like 115 or so. He's like, would that count as freshman English or as an English class? And would a family need to submit that? And how would that be different than I'm assuming when, for taking a example, students in the Sherwood School District and they take a English class that when it comes through, we're just like, this is they. We're assuming because it's in Oregon, they've taught it to standards and everything else and it meets the requirements and we just put it on the, on the transcript with. The superintendent doesn't approve the Sherwood High School transfer.

start time: 532:09:56.000
end time: 546:38:30.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah. So let me respond to both of those. So the first comment is that there should be some transparency about which courses have the potential to be credited at the high school level and that families and students and educators need to know that ahead of time. Our assumption has been that that would be spelled out in the administrative directive. The superintendent or designee could still, you know, decide what exceptions there might be, but that that wouldn't be the material, that that would be very specific to go into the policy. And so I don't know if that was a valid assumption, but that was what our thinking was.

start time: 547:18:10.000
end time: 552:33:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So I'm in favor of clarity because like I say, I look at if you took a class at an Oregon accredited high school, I think it's fair to assume that it would just transfer.

start time: 553:11:40.000
end time: 553:24:00.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Right.

start time: 553:29:00.000
end time: 557:01:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Because and I'm wondering like for this particular case, is it because it's from a charter school versus like the example that was given was the charter school versus say Sherwood High school or high school or another.

start time: 557:03:40.000
end time: 582:33:40.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So I'm so I think that's more to the second question that you raised, Director Grim Edwards. And I think one of the kind of salient issues is that high schools tend to be accredited. Middle schools do not, are not generally accredited for giving out for issuing high school credit. So we have an internal system in our district that accounts for that and it is spelled out in here, there is a section at the bottom that talks about out of district credits, that there would be a process for that. We have a similar process that happens with international transcripts where we have person in the office of Student Support Services who does the work of interviewing students, tracking down records, kind of trying to make sense of what credits can be transferred. And we've had a lot of students as an example from Ukraine who might not have written documentation. And so the interview process processes in place to try to make sense of that.

start time: 583:14:40.000
end time: 594:38:58.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Because I think you had said like the example of Sherwood that it would just be accepted because it's an accredited Oregon high school. So I'm wondering if C is really actually like non Oregon accredited high school to get the point about the middle schools. But if, if a student has taken a high school level course in Oregon and they got a C, we're not going to have the superintendent decide whether or there doesn't need to decide whether that is A counts.

start time: 594:39:14.000
end time: 601:10:50.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Are we correct? Yeah, it's already been validated by the other school district and charter schools are also generally accredited. So I don't think it's an issue of whether it's a charter or A district school. I think it's an issue of whether it's a middle school or a high school.

start time: 601:27:50.000
end time: 606:38:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So maybe the language on C should be high school level courses taken outside of Oregon accredited high schools books be reviewed and approved because this just says outside of PPS.

start time: 607:49:10.000
end time: 611:06:32.000
confidence: 0.97
F: And so I'm sorry, I don't. I think that you would say that outside of Oregon would be different than pps.

start time: 611:08:56.000
end time: 616:29:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Well, my assumption is if we're going to accept Sherwood or Milton Freewater or Medford or Marshfield High and Coos Bay if it's taken at an accredited high school in Oregon, that there's not going to be the superintendent review. It just is an automatic.

start time: 617:09:30.000
end time: 621:03:10.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Yeah, I hear you. I agree. I mean we do students from out of state do transfer in but again that is at the high school level they can transfer their credits in.

start time: 622:06:50.000
end time: 623:03:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So it's in the U.S. so.

start time: 623:57:30.000
end time: 640:47:20.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Yes, I think that outside of the U.S. there is, it is a different situation. But yeah, I think that this, I think that what sea is getting at is that we know within PPS what the high school credit courses are like in middle school. We have an internal mechanism for defining all of the qualifying characteristics. We don't necessarily have that in any school outside of PPS if it's taken at the middle school level. We assume if it's taken at the high school level that it is high school credit worthy and that schools are are accredited. But we don't know this that the same is true outside of our district.

start time: 641:33:40.000
end time: 675:50:50.000
confidence: 0.93
D: I can just chime in a little bit. I'm glad. I really like the. When you talked about earlier about getting together with interested parties and relevant parties to work on the ad. I think that's important especially with the tag AC Office. Right. And office peoples. I think one thing I would I kind of favor in terms of policy. I generally like the policy being a little bit more like you said, setting up guardrails and then having the AD be more specific. Because part of the problem with not the problem, one of the awesome things about students is that there's so there's so much variety in capabilities and one of the things is that graduation is not necessarily, necessarily just shouldn't just be determined based on how many credits. I mean there's some kids that we get that they're ready to move on at age 16. Right. And there's some kids who have a lot of credits but they haven't quite matured. You know, just need a little bit more time to cook. Right. Sorry, I don't know if I used that Phrase properly. But I think the idea is that I would more favor more local control over it, you know, because, you know, I like that it was mentioned in this policy about how, you know, just having credits, you know, we're trying to compel them to take more advanced credits and move into that. But yeah, I think I would, I would be more in favor of the ad being more definitive about what credit because I think the issue with there is that different situations that we may not be able to foresee are going to arise. What if there are institutions out there that actually do have subpar standards or don't meet our standards or vice versa? It could happen the other way. And I think the ad allows that flexibility that a policy doesn't. And so I would be more in favor towards a more guardrail E policy like we have.

end time: 683:05:02.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Yes. What I'm on, see, the issue I'm having is like we don't actually do that for ether. Oregon for ether. If you're outside of PPA but you're still within Oregon. I think what you said was it.

start time: 683:05:26.000
end time: 685:08:30.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Just transfers high school to high school. And so I don't know if this is where we're getting.

start time: 687:27:50.000
end time: 692:29:00.000
confidence: 0.98
F: I think what might clarify this is I think we should have said high school level or high school courses taken in middle school outside of Portland public schools or taken prior to ninth grade.

start time: 696:00:10.000
end time: 698:13:10.000

start time: 701:05:30.000
end time: 713:25:10.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Well, I actually don't think it's redundant. So not every, not every school district is going to allow is going to have the same high school credit earned prior to 9th grade policy that PPS has. So if, let's take the Sherwood example. Say you're a middle schooler and you take a class at Sherwood High School and you get credit for it and then you're transferring to pp. Yes, I'm saying that we wouldn't recognize it. I understand. If it was Sherwood Middle School.

start time: 713:31:30.000
end time: 716:47:22.000
confidence: 0.95
F: No, I'm saying that we would. That Sherwood High School has already accepted that and transcripted it and so we would accept that transcript from Sherwood High.

start time: 723:35:40.000
end time: 730:59:10.000
confidence: 0.90
A: We're saying that we don't do that for. If it's. If there are other organizations, accredited high schools, like they don't go to the superintendent, they just get approved. So I. And we're not moving this out today. So we figure out how to wordsmith it that we indicate that if it's an Oregon high school, that it.

start time: 731:49:30.000
end time: 733:40:20.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I think that's right. I think there's some additional questions about the out of state high school transcripts that staff needs to come back and.

end time: 740:23:20.000
confidence: 0.92
C: But you have PPS other Oregon US outside of Oregon International. I think we want to think through the impact of that. The superintendent individualized transcript review should be the exception, not the rule.

start time: 740:43:40.000
end time: 753:07:00.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Right. I mean typically a high school counselor is the person who receives the transcript from another Oregon or US high school and transfers the credits over. So yeah, I mean if it's. If a credit taken prior to 9th grade is already validated on that transcript, it already transfers over. And we're not suggesting that that should change. I do think that that is complete without that C. So I'm agreeing with the suggestion of wordsmith.

start time: 754:11:30.000
end time: 756:58:34.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I think I would leave it in. But be clear that other Oregon high school credits just. We can wordsmith it.

F: I think.

start time: 757:02:26.000
end time: 784:46:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Do you understand what I get at? Okay, so I'm going to get to a more fundamental question because I think the policy will leave parents totally guessing about what? Like why is the world language different or why is math different? And from my understanding, what's been stated before is it's. Well, there's like a different socialization purpose for having English not applied, not because they're not getting like English fundamentals. Conceptually, I think. Well, not conceptually. I think what we're telling students is if you take Spanish in 8th grade, that is this equivalent of high school and you meet the high school standards, you get the credit. Same thing with math. If you did the exact same thing with English or these other subjects, I'm not sure which they are, but I'll just use English because that's the one that seems to be the focus that you. Then you could go through all the coursework. But that's not the point necessarily of the English class in high school. I'm just, I'm trying to make sense of it.

start time: 785:09:10.000
end time: 798:24:10.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So you know, we, what we saw last meeting was that we needed to take a step back and that the courses that we have been saying you can earn high school credit in were not written. And so we haven't had a conversation with the superintendent about this. We wanted to kind of open it up for that to happen so that that could be defined. But we have not, you know, had that kind of a conversation since the last meeting to be able to answer why or why not a specific course? Does that make sense?

start time: 798:51:10.000
end time: 816:18:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: It does, but then I think we should get that. To me, then it doesn't. Still doesn't answer the question, because as a parent, I would never know that, because my logic model is you have this type of accredited standards curriculum that you should get credit for it. But it seems like PPS is saying, well, we have this other thing that we value that's actually more important that's not listed here, which doesn't have anything to do with necessarily the curriculum, but it has more to do with your being successful as a ninth grader and being part of a cohort in an academy. And. And so when I look at this, I don't get any of that. And I think we should just be really clear from my standpoint, because otherwise I don't think we've actually made a significant difference or been very clear about why we might differentiate.

start time: 816:39:10.000
end time: 819:19:20.000
confidence: 0.90
D: Could you get English credit but not necessarily applied, like a specific credit, you know, like English. No ninth grade credit. Could it just be English credit? Like, would that be a. Okay solution?

start time: 819:39:40.000
end time: 823:02:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: What the district is saying is they don't. Even though the policy doesn't say it is, they haven't given 9th grade credit for English of whatever it is.

start time: 823:55:40.000
end time: 845:34:30.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So the current practice is around some of the. It's definitely around English language arts curriculum and instruction at the ninth grade level. And you're right, it is around the model under measure 98 and the ninth grade cohort. We, you know, haven't had that conversation about the implications of changing that. That if we did list English in the policy, we would probably have to go back through our Measure 98 plan and make revisions because it would disrupt that cohort model. So that's. Those are the kinds of implications that with interim and not yet kind of sworn in superintendent, we haven't been able to really have those conversations yet. And so that's why we would defer that to the administrative directive and just keep this policy at this time. This way.

start time: 846:46:20.000
end time: 858:38:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So I'll just make a statement. Whether it's in the administrative directive or the policy. I think we should just be really clear because Otherwise it just seems very subjective where you have like, normally it's a very standards based. Like you do X, Y and Z, you get this credit. Like again, any other, if it wasn't in middle school, but any other high school, if they, they were transferring to pps, they missed say their sophomore year, they transferred into pps, they weren't part of a cohort because they weren't there for their freshman year. They wouldn't have it anywhere. But we wouldn't say you need to go back and take your freshman year because you didn't have it as part of an academy.

start time: 859:03:50.000
end time: 871:00:50.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Correct. We would offer Virtual Scholars, Portland Evening Summer Scholars as a chance to make up a course, which happens a lot for a transfer student whose previous high school did not require that course at their last grade level. But yes, what I want to be clear is that we're not trying to obfuscate anything or not be transparent. It's, it's important that the ad is transparent. We are just not at that point where all of the implications of.

A: So say there was time given to like, okay, the board has conceptually signed off on the broader language of the policy, but we're not going to actually put it through its 21 day public process until it's a draft ad. And that way people can see what it actually looks like. I don't know, Liz, is that okay? That might work.

A: And the other thing though, I want to go back to also the question I thought that Jessica raised, which was a really good one, because if you don't practice, participate in sports or some other activity that requires a minimal level of senior year credits. Two of my three kids, their senior year, the only thing they had required was English. They played sports, so they took a full load. But I think the questions that Jessica raised are really good ones of like, we have an A class schedule. Are we just hanging on to kids, some of them in their senior year? Because theoretically with an A class schedule, you could have all your credits needed for graduation with the exception of the English credit. And I mean, obviously I think it's a great idea for kids to have their whole high school experience, but we've structured it in a strange way. And then to say, well, you've got to come back for that high school credit and we're not going to. That's the only one that you can't, that's the only sequence you can't actually complete by the time you Graduate seems like a very odd construct.

start time: 912:11:00.000

F: I think that the desire, the hope is that we are giving students lots of opportunities for advanced coursework, for three years of cte, to be CTE completers, for AP courses, for dual credit courses. And it's not just one period of English that it's really, you know, designed so that there can be a robust four year experience.

A: I guess since we're going to have more time, I'd like to see the data on how many of our seniors have all their credits to graduate. Pretty much besides English, especially like students who come in with any sort of language credit, most of them are just completely done. I've just seen that a lot. And then I think we get students like, why are they, are they hanging on to us just for them, for the money? Because I only have one more credit to take.

start time: 930:50:40.000
end time: 932:10:48.000

end time: 940:54:50.000
confidence: 0.93
A: No, I was just saying like, for example, most kids who are in the dual immersion programs, they head into high school with high school credit. And so then they have 32 more opportunities in addition to that to get the 24 credits.

A: I'm sorry, the data I'm looking at I guess is like for high school seniors, what number of them have like one or two credits that are required by their senior year? Because if you get forecasted into generally a schedule that gets you on track to. For most students to have everything done but your English credit by the time you're in your senior year.

D: Maybe had an idea of suggesting maybe an alternate pathway because I don't want to go out and start looking for solutions to problems that we don't may not be a big problem. Right. So like, I would think a more organic way to approach the need that is addressing would be to poll our high school counselors. Right. If there are underlying issues of students who are stuck or need to graduate early or, you know, things like that, they would be the ones to know. Like in terms of just sheer numbers of people who have issues that need to be solved. Because I feel like, you know, one of the things I don't want to also. Yeah. Anyways, that would be my suggestion for an alternative pathway to kind of find the root of the problem and make the system a little bit more effective or efficient is to maybe tap our principals and our high school counselors.

start time: 970:21:14.000
end time: 985:45:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So I think that's a great idea. And I also would like to see the data I just think it's a good data point. I mean having spent 10 years with high schoolers in my household and a lot of their friends I heard a lot about, especially once PPs shifted to. Because most of my kids were in high school and PPS shifted to the eight, to all the high schools having eight credits because it used to be just, I think Roosevelt and Jefferson and then everybody shifted because it used to be 507. Maybe that was when you were teaching that that was eight. And so it just means there's like so many more opportunities and lots more kids just being done earlier. But I think that's a great data point. Do you want to formulate what the question that you want to have asked and just share it with Lorna? Not necessarily now, but.

D: You don't have to. Yeah, I don't know specific questions, but it would just be certain. Like do we have any issues with our. With kids with enough credits early or not enough or you know, just. I think because yeah, I don't have a specific question formula but I feel like this is a problem that kind of needs a more like I think a more effective approach would be from a more ground up grassroots problem solving methodology.

start time: 995:48:40.000
end time: 1010:17:20.000
confidence: 0.97
F: We can definitely get the data on the number of seniors who have just one or two credits still required by senior year. We can also work with counselors to get this kind of more qualitative data. It will be in the fall when counselors return to work. Is the only thing on that that there's a little bit more of a delay there? And I think, you know, the other thing that I can get more kind of precise information on is the Division 22 report that we send out does ask the question about how many students don't have a full schedule. And so that's another data point that we report to the state.

I: Hello, my name is Leah. L E A H star S T A R R I use she her pronouns. Thanks for listening to me tonight. I'm a science teacher. I teach chemistry at Benson High School. And there's been a lot in the news about the harms of Phone use for teens. And I think we're all sort of aware of that data. And what I'd like to speak more specifically to is how phone use really impacts the way that I'm able to teach the curriculum that PPS has in place in science. So we use the patterns high school science sequence and it's used in physics, chemistry and biology. And there are three pedagogy design principles of the curriculum that are really negatively impacted by phone use in class. One is science is a collaborative process and students are just because of phone use outside of school, they're just not used to collaborating. And if there are phones in the classroom, it makes it really, really hard for me to help them learn that process and give them a chance to engage in collaboration. One of the other principles is that science uses inquiry to discover and make sense of patterns. And one of the things we ask the kids to do is make a wild guess when we're first starting to learn about a phenomenon. And a lot of kids are just not used to even taking a wild guess about things these days. Right.

I: It'S. I see kids not inclined to be curious because they are conditioned to look things up on the Internet and get answers lickety split, whether the answers are true or not. They're not trained to sort of follow up on that. So that's another difficult thing that I see. And then the third design principle is science learning is a language rich experience. And one of the ways that this is defined is that PPS science curriculum and instruction emphasizes speaking, writing, interacting, reading and listening. And I've been specifically trained to include talk activities. Can I continue? Okay. Which help kids learn how to interact through speaking and listening. And they're not ready to do it because they're used to being on their phones and they just don't have the practice doing that. So thank you very much.

G: Hi, my name is Carrie Zombrano. I teach earth, space, science and biology at Benson High School. I've been working at Portland public since 2007 and in education since 1993. So thank you for your volunteer work to improve outcomes for our students. I'm here to share my experiences about classroom cell phone use. My hope is we can move forward forward together to improve student mental health, social skills, educational engagement and student teacher relationships. Schools need district guidance and policy if we are to achieve our graduate portrait that includes inclusive, collaborative problem solvers, inquisitive critical thinkers with deep core knowledge, positive, confident and connected to sense of self. Over the last 10 years I've seen focus and interest deep decrease. Current students are less likely to engage in a discussion and make connections or problem solve. A 2017 study shows a direct correlation between the cell phone proximity and decreased working memory capacity. How does this affect learning? To quote the study, the capacity of working memory can determine how many items can be held in mind at once in order to use the items together or link them to form a new concept in long term memory. Memory and the mere presence of a cell phone is decreasing that capacity. This last February, I strictly enforced the often away policy giving students one warning about a phone. Then if a student took it out again, I collected and kept it. This relied on my watchful eye and reduced my focus on the lesson and helping students. I did have positive student teacher relationships so most complied. Most of the time. Thereafter I observed them talking more with each other other looking relaxed and catching up with friends. My anecdotal observations are mirrored in a recent Pew National Trust survey. 75% of teenagers felt happy and peaceful when they don't have their phones. However, one student in particular chose not to come to class because he didn't want to give up his phone. Policing cell phone use by individual teachers degrades the student teacher relationship. If school staff enforced a single policy, it would be clear, consistent and take away most negativity and or confusion that results from different policies in different classrooms.

J: Hello, my name is Jamie Hamburg. I've been teaching at Portland public schools for 15 years now. I teach algebra and over the years I have seen cell phones become the biggest problem in our schools by far. Study after study shows the negative impacts on education, social, emotional cyberbullying at school. We even have the Surgeon General putting warnings on websites now or apps. As a teacher, it's a constant battle. I'm stopping my classes to deal with cell phone use. It's not only hurting the kid who's pulling out his cell phone, it's hurting the kids in the classroom as well. We need structure, we need guidance and it needs to be at the district level. All the schools should Be dealing with the cell phones in the same way. That way it's consistent for the teachers, it's consistent for the students, it's consistent for the administration. I think personally that this issue is so easily solved by being able to have clear guidance. And it helps the students in so many ways. It raises grades, it gives them better social, emotional situations. And I have students who even agree with me. So I have a letter of thanks from one of my students. And I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I will read this. I don't like math because of that. I like to be on my phone all class. If my teacher allowed it, I needed someone who would hold me accountable and not take any excuses. I think that's what we need right now as a district. We need to be accountable. We need to hold them accountable, the students and the teachers, to enforce the policies that are laid out. But it's got to be from a district level. It can't be just the school if it comes from the district. It takes the pressure off the teachers and off the schools. Thank you.

A draft student cell phone use policy which would be a district wide policy. And this was came out of last committee meeting's discussion about staff coming back with a sort of sample policy for us to sort of pressure test and also to have an opportunity here from various constituencies that we know will want to weigh in. And it's surprisingly short, I think at high level. Liz, do you think this would have a ante that would go with it or.

Appreciate Eddie, that you already gave us the Benson one and then to get some live comments from. From real vets and teachers as well. But probably have some additional ways to get feedback from teaching staff and families.

D: Interestingly, I actually don't think this goes far enough. So a couple things I want to add. One, so I understand doing a policy is going to take a while. One thing to keep in mind, we're not the first district to ban cell phones, right? This path has been laid before us. A couple things I also want to keep in mind too is that we also need to figure out maybe this is in the ad, but also how to restrict social media on our school's wi fi, right? Because if they don't have their cell phones, they may. There's a lot of instances where students are just going to escape to the library or steal a Chromebook and get on that way. So tackling the problem at its root. The other thing I also want to also add is that one of the most. Okay, so we know from best practices in education and educational studies that students thrive with consistency. And I really want to stress Jamie, Mr. Helmrich's statement about, you know, students need consistency. And one of the, one of the struggles that we have as educators is that when a student is in high school, they have eight different teachers, eight different policies on cell phones and it's just impossible to keep track of. And so not only is this a time saver for students, it's also a potential time saver for teachers. I'm also willing to. I know that it takes a long time to work out a good policy. So I also had a really long conversation with, with James McGee, the principal at Grant, about what led up to the decision to go with the pouches. And I think if we were trying to serve our students best this year, I think it would maybe we may want to explore, I would like to explore a two tiered pathway. One is that, I think because one of the things is that the first ten days of school. There's a wonderful book about classroom management by Henry Wong about the first ten days of school. And it's saying, yeah, yeah, no relation, it's spelled with an O. That the first 10 days of school is like utterly important for setting school culture, for classroom management, setting policies, procedures, all the routine stuff that's vital for teacher to have success for the rest of the year. And if we wait till January to set a policy, it may be too late. It's shifting. Horseman. So a lot of people are asking us to give direction. Would it be possible to give direction saying, hey, this thing is coming because we have a lot of principles that may want to do something, but they're reluctant to do something because it's not district policy. Right. And what we do really need is that, you know, like what is mentioned here is that the principal may set specific policies that are much more stricter. I would like to explore a potential to empower our principals to set definitive policies because that way it takes the hands, takes this responsibility out of, you know, all their teachers. Hands. Right. To enforce individual policy. It's a lot. Yeah, it's a lot. So, and then, you know, because one of the things I came out talking with James McGee and I asked him if it was okay to share this and he said it's great, it's fine. Was that, you know, he would advise, you know, because I asked about, you know, what about voucher, you know, the pouch system or the total ban. He would advise that we. He would, he said that he would know very definitively by even as early as November or December what has worked and what, what needs a little bit refinement or maybe some holes that they have missed. And learning from that lesson would be very valuable. I think. I agree as well. But at the same time, I think this is something that a lot of our teachers are asking us to do. And it would be really responsive of us to do something. Yeah, yeah, sorry. I'm trying to be quick.

start time: 1298:04:46.000
end time: 1301:22:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: And one thing, just an assignment. When you say doesn't go far enough, can you spend some time before the next meeting sort of outlining what that is? Like how would you go further?

start time: 1301:28:40.000
end time: 1310:31:04.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Yeah, I think the problem here is that it leaves a lot of interpretation about. So one of the things is like, you know, who's enforcing it? Right. Because one of the problems is if the teacher has to enforce it, we're not really solving the problem because, you know, it's the same problem and they're the same solution where the teachers are responsible for enforcing it and confiscating it. And then we have liability issues. I mean, yeah, it mentions a little bit of liability issues here, but, you know, if a teacher. Teacher takes a phone and then it gets stolen or whatever, who's liable? And it's just a lot to. There's a lot to.

confidence: 0.94
A: What I would ask you to do, I think this is the. Apply this to is just drop in the document like interact changes or the comments like where you think doesn't go far enough or we need X so that we start getting those specific areas where you think there needs to be more clarity. Okay. Michelle, popcorn?

end time: 1346:56:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yes. So I am really happy to see this on our desks when we talk to teachers. We know and I thank all of you teachers for coming in. We know that they're a distraction. Even if there's a policy in one classroom, just having one student with a phone out is enough to distract every student because they're salivating because there's a phone out and it's distracting. So it's a really good thing to work on. To your point, we do have lots of other districts, including the districts that I'm in contact with around the country that already have sample policies that I think we could bet and I would encourage us. It's summertime, but it would be great to roll out this bold district wide city. This is our city. These are our kids. We're protecting their brains. Kind of a bold rollout because it's important to do this when our kids are. Their brains are developing right now. I'll also, to be honest, did not read through this with a critical eye, but I will. I'll take a look and see if it needs strengthening. I know there's the pouches that are available at performing arts venues that have been successful. They're already calling us, you know, asking if we'd like to meet so there's a lot of interest and a lot of eyes on Portland. And I think this is the time to do something, you know, bold that protects our students. I mean, there's a reason why, you know, Google, Apple, you know, the founders of these organizations, companies do not let their kids have social media access or phones or devices. So, yeah, I'm really in favor. I'll take a look with a critical eye and would hope that we could maybe even start to socialize at our summer leadership academy.

H: Yeah, I've been reading a lot about it and just read an article today, in fact, that said even though it's bad in high schools, it's really damaging to junior high brains and we have to for sure get them out of the junior highs. And also from most of what I read is parents sometimes object at first, but they come around because parents are dealing with it in their homes too. They can't get their kids off it. So I think everybody knows it's hard. So I would love to work with you about getting something. I would love to see it happen in September. Maybe it can't. Something. And like you say that first 10 days of school, if it's not. If something is, it's hard to do it after that. Gotta get something going. So I went, might not be loved. We're often not loved. But, you know, I think something has to happen. It's scary to me.

D: Do to kind of give a little bit of experiential background. So the experience at Grant. Right. So before Grant, before Principal McGee told everyone that they're going to move to the pouches next year, Grant already had a policy just like this one. It was not allowed during school, basically. And when I was talking with him, one of the things that he mentioned too, was that even with that policy, it was very difficult, difficult to enforce. And that's why they escalated to the next step, which is the pouches. Right. And so I think we need to take that in count because if we just do a policy like this or what Grant had, we're just repeating the same mistake, right? Not a mistake, but an ineffective, partially effective solution. So I think we're going to have to be a little creative I think with this. But yeah, my, my goal was to I would like something by September.

A: Okay, seems like the best way to go. So I hear very clearly bold try and move quickly. I want maybe just for a moment Liz, can you. Because there also was a mention about other districts policy share how you. How we got this draft or what this basis. I mean you can Google there are tons of different policies. You know, Mary is the primary drafter.

C: Of this as a starting point and it was largely taken from LAUSD from where Los Angeles Unified. Okay, so looked at other. She's looked at other policies in other places but that seemed like a starting point for the committee's discussion. So it's not exactly. We modified it from there, but that was how it came to be.

A: It would be great. Maybe we could send that information where it came from. We've had for several meetings we've had like just sample draft policies. I mean you can go, you can look see state statutes now in Canada, I think five of the provinces have cell phone bans in schools. So there's lots of examples. And I take it the staff pulled sort of the basic fundamentals. And again I think the best way to quickly iterate is to people put in their questions or comments and, and we can sort of look how we can build on this one. And I think you have a really good point Eddie, that how it translates and gets implemented because yes, yonder those pouches are one example. That's what Mount Scott Learning center has used for. I mean they've got a whole year. It's obviously much smaller than Grant. What Grant's doing also from other schools, like maybe we don't want to pick a particular brand or a vendor or we have a different solution. So I think that would be maybe part of like the questions that we are asking administrators is, you know, not everyone has the resources, not every district. So like is the district going to provide that to every middle school, every high school? Are there other solutions that cost less besides picking a particular vendor? So it's a great question but I also think we have to be careful not to just like this is the One solution that is going to work for everybody.

C: I think that's an excellent point in thinking about how it's implemented. Things that we also wondered and had some interactions about in the draft. I think people. It's easy to imagine the classroom, but what about the hallways during lunch? What about on a field trip? And so thinking about the various applications, when it gets very detailed about it needs to be in a locked location. But if you're on a field trip or you're. That's may not during the school day, that may not be possible. Does it apply during the school day or to school activities? What happens when you're traveling for an athletic event? So we. You'll see the language in here. We tried to wrestle with those again as a starting point for the committee, which was I think the inappropriate assignment. But I would think through various places where we are in charge of students and they have or should or shouldn't have access to cell phones. And if not, what happens to them? And I think that's some of the texture as you're reading through it to think about.

A: I mean, Frankie asked, I think a really good question. Like when we say, you know, before or after school, it's like we gotta be clear like on school grounds or like at school activities versus like you can't use it after school even if you're at home, which is ludicrous. So those are the types of things that I think we need. All of your eyes are raising questions about. And then I think again, we don't have to create the wheel because lots of other entities are doing this, but we should drop those in. But use this as a starting base. And sometimes the end. I think about our professional conduct policy where we started with like a straw, straw man concept. And then by the very end, I don't think there were very many words that were from the original policy, but it was a very well crafted policy and all thought through. But we need it is something to start with. So view it in that sense. So put those in there. If you have comments, questions, suggested, other languages or wonderings, drop those into the comments and we'll go from there. And I think the other thing I'll do is put together, I think we.

A: So the other thing I'm going to do is and again this will be a strawman so take it as such is thinking about the charge of what if we could have it done by September. So I'm going to lay out a draft timeline to see whether that's practical. And I think Director Wong Yu had a good suggestion that sometimes like the 21 day comment period and everything else it's possible I think just to frame up of like here's where we're heading schools so you know what's coming. So it may not actually be all the way through the process yet, but the general outlines that maybe that might be done if we can't hit like a September.

B: I also want to just note that that Leadership Academy is where all of our building administrators attend. Would be a great time to. If we are getting prepared to say we will be rolling this out. I mean as a communication tool and I think it is summertime so people are traveling and vacationing. So I just again want to make sure that people don't think we're rushing this through but rather it's the first. We're aiming for that first 10 days foundation.

start time: 1505:19:40.000

D: Yeah. I mean could we even have just a very simple statement something like principles shall create a unified or consistent self own policy until further than the noise.

end time: 1516:06:22.000

A: I think we may get lots of different policies and it may be then hard to undo them. I think it's better to have general guidelines from the district that may supersede it versus asking individual principals to do that. They just may be all different. And then we.

A: So I guess I'm going to move the accountability up from. I think we heard very clearly from teachers like that move it up to another level. But I would suggest we should move it out of the principal level. So again they're not having to become the experts on what it might look like. But I think we could give that to principals and so they would have something, some guidance.
