A: Good evening everyone and welcome. We're pleased you guys are joining us this evening. Want to share a few reminders? Well make a statement. Director Green will not be here tonight as he is handling some God work at the moment and so he will not be with us today. Also a couple reminders. In order to ensure safety, please keep walkways and aisles clear. Please keep any signs below chin level so those seated behind you can see. So what we're going to do is Superintendent, would you like to introduce the item? First item. Good evening Chair Hollins. Yes, absolutely. Tonight we are actually pleased to have on display in the boardroom a display of visual art done by many of our Head Start students. And we have a brief video to give us a peek into how our youngest learners actually engage in the arts. Awesome. Portland Public Schools Head Start is a preschool program for children ages 3 through 5. We provide high quality education as well as family support for low income families throughout Portland. The Head Start program is awesome. Today let's learn about one of the parts that makes Head Start great. Art Enrichment Art Enrichment is an authentic art making program led by teacher Tara and teacher Julia. We travel to nine sites, 36 classrooms and capture, motivate and inspire 600 tiny artists per week. Being an artist in Portland Public Schools Head Start is just like being an artist anywhere else. We slow down and focus. We explore with new materials and laugh with our friends. We express emotions through art. We examine and discuss historical artworks to find new connections and to inspire us to create our own unique works. We collaborate with other artists. We use materials to generate new ideas. We connect with nature and explore new possibilities. We use art as a tool for social justice. We find joy in creating a again and again. This program embodies the core values of Portland Public Schools Strategic Plan and targets all domains of the desired results. Developmental Profile, which measures young children's learning and development in PPS pre K programs. Our learning is inclusive and differentiated to support this developmental needs of every child. When we work on techniques like monotype printmaking, we are challenging ourselves to persist in building layer after layer after layer. Our artwork is inspired by artists who represent our student population and to personify values of respect, creativity and social justice. We were inspired by artist Yayoi Kusama to explore collaboration on a grand scale. What can we create together that we can't create alone? Over the course of two days, eight classrooms participated in creating this Yayoi Kusa inspired installation. It feels great to be an artist. Bringing this much joy and beauty is only possible with support from you Portland Public Schools and our school board and our whole huge, amazing, giant Head Start family. We couldn't do any of this without you. I just want to express thank you to Tara Carmichael and Julia Himmelstein. I hope I'm saying your names correctly. They're here with us this evening. Thank you so much for producing this video, giving us a little glimpse into how you make visual arts come alive for our youngest scholars. To all our visual arts teachers, teachers across the school system, thank you for continuing to inspire our students. Thank you. That was awesome. Next we have Black History Month was created to focus attention on contributions of African Americans to the United States. It honors all black people from all parts periods of U.S. history and offer us a moment to lift up the rich history of Black Americans. Director DePass, would you like to introduce this resolution? Sure. And before doing so, if I may read a few remarks. Just personal reflections. As Black History Month unfolds, I find myself reflecting on the diverse experiences that have shaped my identity, particularly the intersections of growing up in Portland, Guadalajara and Washington, D.C. each of these locations has left an indelible mark on my understanding of history, culture, and the unique challenges faced by black individuals in these different urban landscapes. It's been enlightening to navigate and experience blackness from such diverse vantage points. Portland, known for its reputation of progressiveness, has provided a backdrop for both pride and struggle. While the city embraces the slogan of keeping things weird, some argue at the expense of racial progress, nevertheless, there's a concurrent commitment to the ethos that Black lives matter even as our community's leaders of color face targeted attacks at our workplaces and our homes and cars. And glaring disparities persist, especially for our students, as demonstrated by a greater than 54% achievement gap between White kids and their Black kids Black peers in third grade reading scores. This juxtaposition highlights the complexity of being Black in the Pacific Northwest and underscores the ongoing need for activism and social justice efforts, which have deeply influenced my sense of urgency for advocacy, celebrating Black achievement and celebrating the joy of being Black. My time in Mexico added another layer to my cultural tapestry, immense in a society with its own intricate history of race and identity, I gained a deeper appreciation for the nuances of blackness within a global context. Mexico's rich cultural heritage emphasized the importance of acknowledging and embracing diversity, of deep respect for ancestors, while also prompting necessary conversations around Afro Latinx identities and experiences. Washington, D.C. as the nation's capital, offered a unique lens through which to view Black history and its enduring impact on American society. The White House was built by enslaved people. And the city's museums and monuments, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture, stand as powerful reminders of the resilience and triumphs of Black Americans. Growing up in these environments and with the supportive family structure that I did instilled in me a profound appreciation for strength of Black community and the imperative to preserve and share its stories. Black History Month serves as a crucial time for reflection, celebration, and education. It encourages us to explore the diverse narratives within the black experience, recognizing that Black history is multifaceted and rich with threads of resistance, resilience, innovation and triumph. This reflection challenges me to engage with the complexities of identity and history, fostering a commitment to ongoing learning and advocacy. In conclusion, as I reflect on this rich tapestry of experience woven through my upbringing in Portland, Guadalajara and Washington, D.C. i'm reminded of the imperative to understand and honor Black history beyond the confines of Black History Month. Embracing the lessons gleaned from each locale, I invite others to join me in using empowering language and and concerted efforts to advance the ongoing narrative of Black excellence. Together, let us strive towards cultivating a community that is truly inclusive and equitable for all. You're welcome. And so am I introducing the resolution. Yes. Trying to get my chicken meatball recipe off my screen. You might want to share that with everyone. Shall I just read the. I mean, not the entire proclamation. Why don't we just read the resolution? Oh, and it's very small. The Board of Education of the Portland Public Schools hereby recognizes the month of February 2024 as Black History Month and encourages all educators to commemorate this occasion with appropriate ceremonies, instructional activities and programs. The struggles and achievements of black people and their roles in America's history profoundly influences and enriches the culture of the United States. Portland Public Schools acknowledges these contributions and reaffirms its own ongoing commitment to building awareness in an inclusive society. Thank you. Do we have a motion and second to adopt Resolution 6833? So moved. Second. Is there any other board discussion? Thank Director DePas for sharing your story in the framing up comments. Really set the stage for the resolution. Thank you. You're welcome. It's my pleasure. The other board comments. All right. Ms. Bradshaw, is there any public comment? No. The board will now vote on 6833Proclamation and recognition of February as Black History Month. All in favor, indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. All opposed? Student Director Silverstein, please indicate your vote. Yes. All right. Resolution passed or is approved by voter 70 with student director service Time unofficially voting yes. All right, next we have the update on the superintendent search. Last week the the board voted to hire Human Capital Enterprises to lead the search for our next superintendent. This is an important first step for us to identify the desired attributes for the next superintendent. And we will be updating the website as well with next steps. All right, now we go to the superintendent report. Well, good evening again, directors and PPS community. I know you were just talking about an update on the superintendent search. Today actually marks my last school board meeting as your superintendent. Next week, my six and a half year tenure will be coming to a close here at pps. So just wanted to share a few prepared remarks, starting with. As I shared earlier when announcing my departure, I just want to express my gratitude for the incredible privilege and opportunity to serve as superintendent. I'm grateful for the trust, support and most importantly, the opportunity to serve and make a difference here in Portland. I'm ending my tenure with deep admiration and respect for the people in our school system, our students, our devoted educators and staff, our school leaders, and our families and community partners. Because all of you PPS is strong. Thank you for everyone collectively for your unwavering commitment to every student, that each and every one of them should have a consistent, high quality, joyful school experience across every single PPS school. Thank you, directors and staff, for your unwavering belief in doing more and doing better for our students in particular, our students of color, our emergent bilingual students, and for students with disabilities. Thank you for holding each other accountable for the success of each and every one of our students. I'm grateful to have served in a district that's committed to both excellence and equity. Together, we navigated the challenges of the last few years. Of course, the global pandemic, extended school closures, growing student needs. The school system is fortunate to have a capable team of leaders, teachers and staff that are dedicated to ensuring our students have the opportunity and the supports to thrive. Despite the challenges we've weathered, I believe PPS has the right tools and foundation to continue improving this school system to ensure student learning and success. Directors in this role, you might imagine, like yourselves, I receive a lot of unsolicited notes and messages as I was cleaning out my desk last night. Late last night, I came across a note dated November of 2017. When I was just a few weeks into the job, I received a personal letter from a staff member at lane Middle School, Mr. Joel Campos, welcoming me to Portland and expressing that he wished my tenure will be Y cambios positivos que Todos unidos lograremos las metas para nuestros alumnos and todas las escuelas. He expressed his hope that in my tenure I would experience success and that there would be many positive changes for our school system. He shares his hope and belief that together we will meet the goals that we have for students all across our schools. My hope is that Joelle, who I had the pleasure of meeting in those early months, personally, that you're out there enjoying a well deserved retirement after your service, supporting our students as a paraprofessional here at pps and that I have left Portland Public a little better as a school system. I remain optimistic about the future of PPS and its students. In the coming days, the team and I will continue onboarding and orienting our interim superintendent, Dr. Sandy Husk. We remain hopeful that the next permanent leader will build on the work accomplished to date and take the school system to the next level. We've come a long way as a school system in a relatively short time, and I look forward to hearing of many more continued successes here at PPS in this next chapter. So with that, thank you, directors, all of you, both past and present, for your support. It's been a privilege to serve as your superintendent. Thank you. Children are dying. Okay. We appreciate the fact that you guys are. We hear you, but this is not going to be the way to get it done today. So we can ask you guys to make sure that you lower your stuff down. If not, we're gonna have to ask you to leave. So we're gonna call for a quick recess and resume five minutes. You silent. Thanks. Now, we left off with the superintendent's report, and so we know there's some comments that board members would love to make to the sleep. Or we could just move through the agenda. I will open up the floor. Well, I'll go quick. Thanks. I think I said before when you announced you were leaving that I only do one goodbye. And so I would wait. So this is it. But I'll still make it short because. I know, I know. I just want to thank you for what you've given the district. I want to thank you personally for welcoming me when I, you know, first arrived four and a half years ago and, you know, hoping, you know, you. You were already here. You had a lot of your team, you were already pretty, Pretty well established in sort of the strategic plan path you wanted to do. But a lot of that work was still in development. And so it was. Was a really good time, I think to come in. And, you know, I think you talked about the challenges. I think we have to continue to mention those because, you know, your tenure here has been full of challenges. And the thing that. And I say this not, I mean, with a little bit of wistfulness, but also, it is what it is. It's a reality. There was that moment sort of recover when I feel like we had set new board goals. You had your strategic plan coming together. You had done a lot, not all, but you had done a lot of the sort of reforms, systemic reforms that you were looking for. And we felt poised to really see the benefits of that. And it was a global pandemic, and you and your team were able to pivot, and you were able to pivot really quickly and do the best we could. You know, you and I have talked on a very personal level about some things we wish we could have done differently then, but it was operating in real time. Right. And moving through that, I started to deal with that, to deal with the funding issues in Oregon, to deal with the, you know, labor, unless last fall and, you know, snowstorms, not just this year, but in prior years as well. I mean, your tenure's been filled with a lot of extreme challenges. But I want to keep coming back to, I think, my experience with you and seeing what's happened during your tenure here. You know, know, this district was in pretty desperate need of some of the systemic changes and reforms that you and your team were able. And I think that change is hard. We know it's hard. I think we can look at some of the bright spots. You know, the increasing graduation rates were here. Even with the student achievement, we didn't see the declines that other districts saw. We're beginning to see, hopefully reap some of the benefits. I'm really hopeful and actually somewhat confident. Changes you were able to put in place that we're going to recur. It's for years to. So I just thank you. I thank your entire team for that. We're poised in a good place. Still a lot of work to do. Always a lot of work to do. Thank you. Thank you. My pleasure to appreciate it. First credit goes to all the folks behind us. I'll jump in next. I want to thank you also just going to, like, thank you for the meetings, I mean, to say, the meetings that we've had outside of here where you've been candid with me about your visions for the district. Yeah. I've enjoyed serving with you. I enjoyed the grace that you showed of me when I was 45 minutes late to our first meeting. So, embarrassingly, I got caught five stories underground. Couldn't get out. So I appreciate your grace. I've learned a lot from your leadership style. And I want to go back to a statement that my dad made. He was like, yeah, that's warrior, and your name means peace. And together you should be able to do great things. So I appreciate your commitment to this district, your unwavering support for, you know, moving racial equity along when even in Portland, it's been very, very difficult. Appreciate your comments that you made about how we can actually dig our heels in and dig into actually making change that we need to see that will benefit students. It's been a pleasure. So I didn't prepare anything, but I just. It was. It's been educational. I think it was. I came from a unique position. I got to work under you. I remember during the turmoil, and then when you came in, it was a lot of hope and. And one of the things that, you know, as someone who has worked in the district, you know, I really appreciate the almost the ferocity of commitment that you bring to this district. I think. I wish everyone could see what I saw because, I mean, there's a lot of things we disagree and start tearing up because it's been a while. I've been working with you for. Under you for a little bit as well. There's a lot of things we disagreed on, and there were a lot of things that I thought we disagreed on that when I got to know you better and learned about the issues, I no longer disagreed, but understood. I think that kind of. I just wish everyone could see that. I wish that everyone could see the. The human side of you where you're so willing to give. I mean, the work here is never done, and you're always so willing to almost sacrifice your health all the time to get as much of the work done as possible. I think a lot of things have been going on here have been unfair to you, but I think you took it with poise. And I think there's just. This was a challenge in general now, and I. I really am. I'm going to miss you. Appreciate it. Yeah, I'm pretty much just going to say what everything you said, Andrew, but also just thank you for welcoming me as a new person, not really knowing what I'm doing on the board. You're a good teacher. You don't tell people what to do. You show kind of different ways you can look at things. So, anyway, it's been wonderful for me. I wish I had more time with you and I look at some of the things you're doing particularly my knowledge is early childhood and I think it's and I appreciate that you you make it happen even when people say or maybe afraid of change but you're making it happen. I appreciate that. Yeah I was just scrolling through 2017 and those first days and I didn't proceed you by much on my at least my second tenure 15 years before but came back on the board in July of 2017 and our most important order of business there were a lot of challenges the board was the district was facing whether it was dysfunction on the board an open sound familiar Pat contract that had been open about a year we had middle school or K8 students who were getting a vastly different and inequitable set of opportunities versus students in middle school middle schools we had bond that would have I don't know you go through the whole litany but there were a lot serious investigation board but our most important thing that we had to do was as a board and we all knew it. No matter what are as board members whether we felt like we could work with each other or not or we had very big philosophical differences we all knew that we were going to succeed together and PPS was going to see if we hired a new leader and a new superintendent after Superintendent Smith leaving the year before and having a whole succession of interim superintendents we knew that we our most important task as a board was to our end leader and there was a disagreement about whether we did the whole waited a year getting the regular cycle and I mean I remember Rita and I having like a back and forth about I felt like if we started this school year without a new leader like PBS was not going to get back on track and we're both very persistent people but I think I won that one out because we need to get going and 40 days we had great candidates surprisingly for the job and I'm glad at the end of the day that you were the candidate that the board landed on and agreed to hire 40 days later and I will say the six and a half years it's like dog years feels like more than six and a half years because just scrolling through the I won't argue with you on that one pardon you know thinking that you then came back several times before you moved here with your moved up here from and helped us open both Fabian and Franklin and we're here for the start of the school year I still every time I see the picture that's still used of that first Day of school, going to Boise, Elliot with you, talking to the kids in the cafeteria. I love that picture and I love every time I see it because she reminds me of that first day and also my pictures. I saw a piece that I wrote for the business journal about new school year, new era at pps and it was a picture of you arriving at pps. And those were the happy days because then we just moved right into finishing, settling, settling the contract with the teachers, which was really important also to get us started on the right foot for the year, your tenure as superintendent. We knew that we had to do really hard work about opening new middle schools. And probably your first year was all about opening those two middle schools. And it was the right thing to do. But it was really hard work, which is why it hadn't been done. There was a lot of really hard work that hadn't been done. And I appreciate that when you got here, you jumped in and helped us do hard work because the easy thing would have been like, let's do some of the easier work. Let me get my feet on the ground. But we just dove right into hard work. And, you know, the following years, as Andrew mentioned, we really laid the groundwork to move this district for our students. Built lots of supports in and our community rallied behind, had a leader with a vision and a board that was united working with the superintendent. Passed the 2019 local option renewal, the 2020, 2020 bond, the largest local option in the state, the largest bond in school history. And that I think is our community having confidence in and trust in the district and where it was heading, which was very different than when you arrived in 2017. And there's a lot of other things that happened in those years. We settled lots of contracts several, several, several times in the six and a half years. We made a lot of differences. For 20 years there wasn't a curriculum in PPS, so my kids spent 18 years DPS with no curriculum, no unified or district curriculum, because curriculum department had been decimated after Ballot Measure 5. And that's being built back. So when I look to the future, I know that whoever the next leader is is going to be building on your successes. So thank you for saying yes and for bringing passion and like, oh my gosh, you work so hard. So thank you, thank you. Of course, we've persisted together six and a half years longer than anybody here in the town. So mine might not be what you expect it's going to be. I'm actually glad to get out this toxic ass town, you know, for A man of color. It's. It's rough and it's tough and you don't get the benefit that you deserve. You don't get the credit that you deserve. And I'm hoping that I know when you get down in your next endeavor, all those kudos and flowering is going to come because you're absolutely brilliant, man. You're brilliant. And you've shown me what Excellency is as a Latino man as well. Right. You know, I know we talk about black history, black excellence, but you show me excellence, you show me the poise when things are said about you and how things is. And it's. I'm happy that you, you did it. You got an exit. This, this town will tear you down and it will beat you down. And I don't want to see any personal color. I want to see you get tore down even more by this time. So I am excited for what your new endeavor is going to be. I love the talks about family, especially about the mom and, and all the other stuff going to here, but it was just great having that and I just really appreciate you. So thank you for, for showing that for. For me. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yes. I think the first thing that comes to mind when I think of you as commitment, growth in your tenure and just like you belief in what is right. Obviously I don't have the same length of experience to some people perhaps, but you know, I brought up through the system, I just want to say thank you because just from my tiny time on the board, it's definitely very difficult. And I cannot imagine what it's like to be the face of the district, the one ultimately in charge. And I know that that is a huge privilege. But I also think that you've done a wonderful job treating that like the honor it is. And just like really not every conversation a lot excited to see what you do. And I think that everyone else in all the places you're going to go are even just as grateful and happy as we are. Thank you. And I know you have a bright future ahead of you. Well, the good thing directors is you have this high caliber team all around you. So I'll be thinking of all of you and continuing, as I mentioned, to hear of the successes. And I'm going to do my part to help the children and youth of Watts and Boyle Heights as next leadership opportunity. So I'll be watching from afar. Wow. Okay. So. Well, since of all Happy Black History Month. And as usual I'm going to start with some celebration. I think it's definitely something you need. So first of all, Benson had two teams that went to regionals for the salmon pool which apparently is like a salmon. Yeah, it's a marine science trivia competition. I think I have that right. Apparently they got first and third so wow. Wells is they're going to get more details on this but they're throwing a glow dance that connects to like the general Portland Lights Festival. Grant and Lincoln's constitution teams are going to nationals. So that's really exciting. And then multiple schools Grant Cleveland, they have communicare and they're donating a lot of money towards groups that support domestic violence survivors community, adding redlining and climate change and prisoner reform. So then also at Lincoln there is going to be a wellness fair next week and this week they're putting on a BLM week of action which I think is pretty incredible. And then at Franklin we just had our winner formal and we also hosted the duck pond competition for high school. Jefferson has their girl responsible team. I believe they're second in the state. They're doing really, really well. And then at McDaniel they made progress which is where student led effort by BSE numbers actually JJ and Casey getting incentives for lunch help us to help the lines go quicker. So I think there's a lot obviously that we need to work towards in our district. But I also wanted to take the time to acknowledge how far we've come and the role that students have played in that. Then we go on. Not so celebratory stuff. I think that the lack of student voice has been especially apparent this year because there have been so many high profile issues. But it is a long term issue and some of the most recent issues have been final schedule. I know students were really frustrated about that and that there was no change after the snow days. And then also probably going to hear about this in public comment tonight. But Franklin students are frustrated about curriculum changes and I think this all really comes back to what you probably guessed is my favorite topic, student voice. Because I think that a lot of these things that we perceive as issues would not be issues if we had more direct inclusion of student voice. I think I spent every single one of my student effort points talking about this and I think not a lot has seemed to change. And I think that there's this idea that it's enough to include students in these conversations to get their feedback later on, maybe feedback about the decisions or once we've narrowed it down to two options. Which do you like better? But I think to truly include voices we need to be there from the very beginning when people are seated around the table having discussed sessions. Many of those seats should be for students. I think that when we're talking with the district student council, that's a big frustration for them because we literally have this advisory council that is meant to do exactly that to collect student perspectives and bring them to the board, bring them to senior leadership. But I think there is a disconnect there and that's not happening. So, you know, I feel like I talked a lot about the problems, but I wanted to give you all some solutions. I think really brainstorming how can we use the DSC more effectively and not just the dsc because we do our best to represent the students of a different. But every single student has an individual experience. And so creating a more specific and obvious way for students to provide their voice. Because I think we have seen that public comment is not sufficient. And unfortunately, the way it works, it leaves a lot of things unresolved because it's exhausting to constantly bring up these issues and then not hear anything back. And a lot of times public comment is meant for after the fact. The board is voting on that thing the next second. That doesn't really provide time for dialogue. So again, saying that students need to be a huge part of every single dialogue in this district and how we ensure that's going to happen going forward. And then a little plug here. That one way that we're going to be doing this is for the district student council. We're hoping hosting our annual student summit on March 7th at 10AMC High School students can RSVP Instagram, the link is in the bio and posters should be put up around your schools. And that's going to be face time with district leaders and to learn about the topics that are going on in our district. And I think this is a great opportunity. But also alongside that, it needs to be more consistent and not just an annual event that we studied students have to host ourselves. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have a quick question. Do you have any thoughts? Like, have you. You've obviously thought about this a lot about how that those conversations might happen prior to like, have you given any thought to like what that might look like? Right. I think that as soon as we have a topic coming up for them, just going to depend obviously on what the topic is about. But reaching out to networks we have at schools because students have really created these already. We have a lot of really strong affinity groups, even clubs. I think the district student council, we can do a Lot of outreach too. So if these topics are coming up, we can always put it on the agenda for districts council and we can get that out to our schools. We can put out surveys. That's been very effective in host town calls. I know Frank was having all about the curriculum discussion. I think it depends on what exactly we're looking for from students and what we're looking for from the topic. But I think those are some of the ways that are going to. Thank you. Is this something that we could, you know, students maybe explore options to create structural changes so that we have more of a pipeline from students voices to. I think that would be get it in the structure. Then it can't be just put it aside when it's not great. So I would like to put that in the agenda and bring people who are interested. March 7th. Yeah. Is there a place to sign up for that? Yeah, it's for high school students, but I think you all have gotten your name. Yeah. And we just go. We don't have to. Yeah. Yeah. I think connect with us so we can make sure scheduling works out because if we get too many board members then it becomes a public. Oh, that's right. Just for a proactive solution, I might ask the DSC to revisit sort of a choice that was made years ago because it used to be the superintendent of the DSC and met with student leaders. Super sac. The super sac. So I very much wanted to respect students wanting to sort of grow, evolve, kind of build the dsc. Then it left this sort of lack of connective issues. So if not a standing part of DSC agenda at a minimum successor but a chance for DSC leadership to have a regular opportunity to at least a simple avenue to share back and forth. And what I'll do is we do have a student engagement specialist that oversees DSC who works closely with you. So we will make sure that our staff follows up with you to address all these concerns that you raised. All right. Next we have student comics. Student. How about that? Do we have any students signed up? We do and going to facilitate that. Say that again. Roseanne is past the people who are going to provide public comment. Okay. Hello. Hello, directors. I'm just pulling up the list and we will. I'll run it from this end. Let me give the directions first. Okay. First of all, thanks each and every one of you for taking the time to attend the meeting and provide your comments. Public input informs and improve our work and we look forward to hearing your thoughts and reflections. Our board office may also follow up on board related issues raised during public testimony. We request that complaints about individual employees be directed to the Superintendent before he leaves. Our personnel map we're saving for the next if you have any additional material, items you would like to provide to the board or superintendent before he leaves, we ask that you email them to Public Comments all1wordpf.net Public Commentsps.net Please make sure when you begin your comments that you clearly state your name and spell your last name. Three minutes to speak you down after three minutes, which mean you'll have 30 seconds to wrap up your comments. Now, I heard at one board meeting that Director Green said he had cut you off. He's not trying to be mean or anything, but he might have to, you know, start playing some music or something. So I'm going take that. I'm going take that up too. Okay? My name is Jennifer Chavez C H A V E Z Student choice is essential for us to succeed. It's what makes or breaks us. Having a freedom to choose our interests allows us to explore what we are passionate about. Thus we have full creative freedom in classrooms. This is necessary because it opens many doors for students and allows us to explore a variety of topics, empowering us to drive our own education. An article from the New York Times School is for Making Citizens touches on how schools helps students into educated and productive adults. So essentially a big shared goal among schools nationwide is to set up their students to be successful after high school. Personally, I have been very interested in business and marketing and wish to major in it. Knowing this and forecasting for my junior year English class, I decided to choose Social Influencing so I can have an opportunity to learn how people and companies influence over an audience. I can use these tools I've learned in this class for the future. So how is setting students up for success to remove classes and essentially forcing students to choose one out of three options for their English credit? Not to mention completely closing off doors for students who thrive in these choice option classrooms. Students who may not be successful in cookie cutter English classes, Dystopian Lit, Women's Lit, Social Influencing and Medlit. All these classes are being replaced with hmh, a Eurocentric literature textbook. HMH consists of texts which are mostly written by white men. The 12th grade curriculum has oppression narratives poems which praise white savior ness. This is little to no bipoc representation in the HMH textbook. Yet it will still be put in the education system so incoming students, especially our students of color, can read these texts by authors who don't look like them. Characters who they can't relate with texts. Talking about bipoc issues from a white man's perspective. Again, no property representation. Taking these classes away from students and taking their freedom to choose these classes based on their interests and taking them without having any type of student voice not only directly impacts us students, but also impacts our trust. If the district made this decision without thinking about their students, how do we know this will not happen again? How can we put trust into a system when we know that it's not? It doesn't support or listen to us? How can we truly feel supported and confident in our classrooms? I am one of many students who feel this way. So to see if other students agreed with this decision, I decided to create a survey. On the very first day of the survey being open, we received over 160 students voicing their thoughts about the removal. Today we have over 100 or 270 responses. All them, all of them said that the removal of English choice options leads them to not feel supported in school. So what will it take for the district to finally hear our voices to see how much this decision impacts us? Have we. Haven't we done enough to show you that this is wrong? Thank you. Thank you. Next is. My name is Shani Ross. R O S Again. I'm Jenny Ross. I'm a sophomore at Franklin High School and I'm here to speak about the removal of English choice classes. I want to start by connecting us to what I'm sure is a very familiar term to you all, interest, or the state of wanting to know or learn about something of someone. Interest is what drives us as students, teachers, administrators and people as a whole. Psychologists refer to interest as a knowledge emotion because of how emotionally charged it is for us. Choice English classes give us the opportunity to learn in a structure and style that is pushing us to exceed in subjects that we enjoy. It also makes us as a student body, unique and have distinctive abilities regarding our passions. A study done by the International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology researched the effects of interest and discipline on learning and learning motivation. It found that interest has a positive effect on learning. To quote the study directly, interest is a powerful dictator and motivator in the learning process. Students are likely to engage in more learning activities when their interests and emotions are positively provoked. Learning with interest would be better than learning without interest. This clearly states what to me is so important. The removal of these classes limits options for courses that are geared towards student interest. A report from the National Institute of Health states that, quote, promoting interest can contribute to a More engaged, motivated learning experience for students. My peers and I could not agree more and I know my teachers feel the same. In addition, I can say that many students feel as though our voices were not heard nor considered for a decision that has direct implications on our high school experience. The emphasis on using textbooks that contain majority white male authors feels very outdated. As well as spotlighting a system that implies AP and dual credit classes are those of most importance for higher education. Not only are these English textbooks written for clean, clearly written for a student body that does not reflect our own, they are also found uninteresting. A student should be able to choose whether they want to expand their literacy and writing skills through women's dystopian or medical literature, typical English courses and AP style English class. As knowledgeable, experienced educators. Where do you think a student will excel most in a course that piques their interest or one that limits their options? Knowing what we know about how important interest is to education, I think the answer is obvious. Thank you. Jaden. She's not here. Okay. And then Jalen. Okay. The other two students are not here. So we're done with student comment. All right. Well, yeah, thanks again for your comments. I know sometimes it's get kind of nervous to do it. So thank you for encourage to come in and speak your truth. Please feel free to contact our senior board manager Roseanne Powell if you have something specifically you want to follow up on with the board or board office. All right. Before we just on this topic had a lot of Franklin's in my school board zone, we've had a lot of communications from students on the issue of the high school English classes. It would be helpful for them for not just for the board to get an answer about what happened in the decision making process, but have it be something that we could, we can share out. So I don't know if that can happen in the sense of more information because I think some decisions were made at schools and just giving students visibility about the rationale behind it would be helpful. Also like I know we have a town hall tomorrow specifically for like school day administration, but maybe we could set up some sort of like town for students to ask questions like district leadership about it so they could get a little more clarity of why it happened. Okay, we have staff here and we'll see what we can do to make sure. And I would use a broader understanding. Yeah, I would just add, I think it's useful for them to ask questions but also to hear about pathways that are available that might not have been taken Right. And who may not have taken those pathways because I think that matters as well. This is super important because I think just having transparency about what, what happened and why decisions are made is everybody a lot more incentive people guessing about it. I think you might hear some of that tonight also. Which is just what you were talking about. Yeah, because I just, I think like some of the disagreement comes over like when people don't understand why the decisions are being made. And I think like it adds an extra emotional layer to feel like you're being excluded from the conversations. Either that isn't actually what's happening or it's not intentional. So just like I think the memos we get and things like that are really important to get out to our communities. Next, would you like to introduce the next item? Yes. We're directors were pleased to share that yesterday the members of the Service Employees International Union ratified the tenant agreement that we were able to reach this past week here tonight to give an overview or share some highlights of that agreement. Genevieve Roh, Senior Director of Employee and Labor Relations. Joining her is Chris Walters from seiu. Thanks for being here this evening. I love that you both coordinated. Okay. Good evening. Good evening directors, Student representative and Superintendent Ferrero. Before you tonight is a three year contract between PPS and the Service Employees International Union, otherwise known as seiu. This group, this contract covers a group of employees, our nutrition service employees, which you are at LinkedIn and then our custodial employees. So these include incredibly important individuals, serve meals to our students and make and make their learning environments clean. We are proud of the agreements in the contract because we believe they recognize the work of these employees. Nutrition services employees will earn across the board 38.5% wage increases over the term of the three year contract and custodians will earn 22.2% wage increases over the term of the contract. Both groups including step increases each year and then one component to the custodial agreement is that we're going to offer, which has not been offered before, part time insurance to custodial employees last time. These two groups are incredibly flexible. They've been incredibly resilient in another year of uncertainties and we've no need for agreement is reflective of their Greetings everyone. We agree that the contract is a significant improvement over the current contract. It is we believe still a stepping stone towards a better future. We appreciate is part time health insurance for custodial and nutrition services employees. From what we are hearing that has already been helpful in terms of recruiting and retention. It was a 20 year fight to get a part time health insurance and apparently it's paying off just like we said it would. Inclement weather was another thing that we're very happy about for custodians. We're still waiting for the compensation for last year's storm, but now having time and a half for those custodians who make is going to be welcome change. And as much as we are happy about a lot of what's in the contract, there's still some areas that we're, we see a need for improvement over time. The nutrition services assistant starting wage, who's still below $20 an hour and doesn't actually hit the $20 threshold until the third year of the contract. And for as much as Portland Public Schools loves to pat itself on the back about being equitable and just we don't feel that you can truly be equitable and just if you're not paying all of your lowest paid employees a living wage. And for a lot of them, our employees, I mean the numbers that Genevieve recited were pretty eye popping but at the lower ends it's not quite as much. And there's a lot of our members that are still going to have to work second jobs just to keep food on the tables and roots over their heads and would like to see that change when we do this again in a year and a half. We know that budgets can be challenge. We are very happy to go down to Salem. I will go down there and testify next to whoever you want me to test next to in front of the legislature because yeah, we need more money for schools, but you know, budget is more document and there are ways to reallocate funds, I think to make sure that living wages are okay to all the of our lowest paid employees across the board. SEIU, DCU, PFSP, etc. We very much appreciate all the support that we got from the community, from all the other unions, from parents, from students and good at that. Thank you. You said it another year and a half, but this is a three year contract, so. Right. So it took us a year of negotiations to get to this point. Oh, okay. And so. And since we're halfway through the first year of the contract, in about a year and a half we're going to be gearing up, putting together another bargaining team to do it all over again. That's. Thank you. I was just gonna. Are you gonna put a motion on the table then? Should we say something we can put it on? Okay. No, I was just gonna thank both sides. I know there were a lot of external factors that happened during the election, the time that you were bargaining. So I really appreciate seiu, the members sticking in there through some really, I think one of the more challenging years we've had. So you know, following on several where SEIU members were there on the front lines. Thank you for being in there. Again, that was a lot of things that were very external to your organization that you kept showing up for our students. So thank you. And then to the end to the district team, thank you for putting together a package that met many of the needs, but not all of them so we can get to in the future. But really want to thank the district team as well for bringing this. Well, thank you. To you both kind of say congratulations and I just, I remember last year like speaking with a lot of your members about during the inclement weather closures and post that. So congratulations and I really hope we can work with that in the future. Thank you. All right, I have a motion and a second to adopt resolution 86841. So moved. Additional board comments Are there any public comments? No. Without voting Resolution 6841, 2023 Agreement between service Employees International Union and School District Number one J County, Oregon by voting yes or approving the collective bargain agreement between SEIU and Portal Public Schools. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. All opposed, indicate by saying no. And I'm going to say no. And the reason why I'm going to say no is like that we didn't get to all employees over $20 an hour. I feel that on both sides that should have been a priority. I wasn't at the table, so I don't know. But I'm gonna just leave it at that. Song Resolution 8641 is approved by Order 6 to okay Early Literacy grant application. So I know we heard these earlier, so I'm gonna just ask for a motion and a second to adopt resolution 6836. Oh, second. All right. Is there any more discussion? You don't have it yet. Are there any public comments? No, I have a couple of questions. I see there that it says this is all. What do they call it? This is the jumpstart biennium 23 to 25. So does that mean that this literacy grant is going to be continued into 26? It sounds like it from what I read. I'm just wondering if that's again, are you referring to the literacy grant keeps Talking about how 23 to 25 is a jump start biennium and that when it continues. There'll be different rules. And I'm just wondering does that mean for sure it's going to keep going? Well, we can't guarantee what our. We don't know but it sounds like readers will do. But it felt that I think is the intent of Christina or cao. That sound right? Yes. And also we have to pay 25% of it, isn't that correct? 25% of the grant money comes from us. There's a match to match. Yeah. Okay. Of course, as you know, many of the elements of our work already sort of are invested in those areas. Okay. So we can count what we're already doing. Okay. I have a couple questions if you want to come up here. Christina. Yeah, I don't know if it's got movement pass along the they get passed along to you left over from last time. There's on the slide number. But the allowable expense category number three, there's a number of students in the summer acceleration academy listed current state and then the grant extension. There's not a number of students. And do we have a number of students? We can get you the number of students. Let me drop that down. Just like know what we're going the from two. And then in the allowable expense category number four, the high dosage tutoring. And we had a conversation about it, but I realized I didn't ask my questions because I was still. We hadn't offered it this year. But who's actually offering that tutor? Is it classroom. The high dosage tutoring, is that classroom teachers? Yes, it'll be licensed educators. So are they getting in classrooms or after school or. I think Dana can speak to this. In the current model, there's a couple different ways we're learning. There's new funding, new resources. But for the remainder of this year, the classroom teachers outside of the school day, as has been a model we've used the past few years. And then I can also. I get this later on before I'm going to be supportive. But just how many students are going to be receiving it out of how many need it. So if you have criteria like x 3000 students qualify and we're going to give it to a thousand. Just understand the scope and then the level. It's been category number five. Category five. There's seven additional schools that we received interventionists and those schools been identified. And what was the criteria got everybody here tonight. Yeah, Elizabeth. Now we'll use a data process to identify those. Absolutely. So currently 30 students get it or 38 students have them and then seven more schools that meet certain criteria. And we'll have some more information tonight. In the ELA section there's a whole slide devoted to this. This. So it, it expands beyond early literacy, but it speaks to this. Some of the things that you're asking and then whatever additional information you would like, we can. Those are my question. Just so if you could afterwards just get them just. Again, I'm trying to understand the scope of. Okay, yeah, I had one more question too. Under in the budget you've got early literacy coaches and early literacy spend specialist. And then it's repeated for each one with a mark saying fringe. What is that? Because these are grant funded positions. We pay salaries and then we also pay all of the benefits that go along. And so we have to budget separately for the state so they can see how that breaks out. Oh, okay, great. Thank you. Any other questions? All right. Are there any public comments? The board will now vote on resolution 6836 for the public schools allocation for the 2325 jumpstart biennium of the Oregon Department of Education early literacy success food district grant. If we vote yes, then we are food and grant application which will be school made it to the state. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. All opposition. No opposition resolution 6836 is approved by vote of 6 0. Director. The Director Suicide on opposition of rolling yes. At the January 23rd work session we had a discussion from proposed 2024 legislative agenda for this your short session which we are holding on this evening. I have a motion and second to adopt resolution 6844 public port of public school legislative agenda. Any board discussion we listen to the presentation first. I don't really have much presentation, but I just want to highlight that we did add a few items since we last discussed it which I had communicated with you about. We've added a some language to give us some flexibility to support any other funding requests that we can support through the session as they emerge. We've also added $41 million in additional funding from the state school fund to cover the gap of paying for our PH contract over the next two years. $41 million for covering the shortfalls of our project. I just want to make sure. So we ask in the state for the $41 million to cover the P contract that they shorten it up at the beginning of the year. Okay? Yes, that's correct. Chair. And then we've added a couple of additional bills related to additional funding for health care and mental Health care for students, lifting the cap on the funds that are distributed to the state school fund for students eligible for special ed services and then funds for climate resilience school infrastructure. We also added an additional category with some long term funding priorities, including funding the QEM and asking the governor and legislature to make structural changes to the state school funding formula that would better serve serve a diverse and urban district like ours, including taking into account differences in cost of living. And then we also going to be asking them to fund us at the qem. Want to make sure that's clear. We're asking them to fund us at the qem. Yes. And one thing I do want to caution us is that the legislature is also looking at. So I do think that we want to, we want to be really mindful of those, the changes that they make to the QEM so that we are using a benchmark that's appropriate, really fully investing in quality education in the event that they do make changes to the QEM that don't meet that benchmark. I guess it would be real disappointing if the numbers start from being lower, you know, all of a sudden. So that raised some red flags. Yes. So I would say we'll just keep that in mind as we still work towards, you know, overall a better way of funding schools. And you talked about the cost of living. So is that to differentiate the cost of living in Portland versus the rural districts? Yes. So there's a multiplier. There's already like a road district adjust, a rural school district adjustment. But there's not really a. No, it's just recognizing that they have students like who are sometimes 50 miles from their school. They have greater cost sometimes because of their very small school districts. And that gets recognized. There's more of them. Right, right. 195 or so. So there already is an adjustment in the funding program for smaller district. So this has been something for 20 years that we've talked about because you just cost more to do business in the metro area. Yeah. It's a scale issue as well. Right. Economies of scale in rural areas versus high cost of housing here. Exactly. And there will be opportunities for us to raise these issues and the work groups and the task forces that the legislature and governor are convening. So I think that's absolutely something we can look at as they look at making changes to the formula and also making sure that they fund any changes to the formula. We don't want, you know, the pie to just get sliced thinner for the. So I think we'll be really vigilant and mindful of those conversations. Comments or discussion. Yes, because I don't want to do this the day after the meeting because it might trigger a public meeting notice. But I'd like to suggest the board send our legislative agenda to all the Portland this week next because the session's gonna be virtually send it a copy of our legislative agenda with things that are most important to us highlighted and sent it collectively from all of us. So I want to raise that issue now and then the other thing is I'm also thinking that as we go into the budget season with our school communities that we also would be good to send that same legislative agenda again highlighting some of the things that are really important to us. Send it out to our in the district so that they can last meeting. Just when we talked about it there was kind of a flurry of emails and texts from people who were interested in advocating and speaking up who know what's coming down the pike that if we don't get resources from the legislature it just seems like it would be good to do that sooner soon as possible just given the regular session. So that's something I'll just raise to the board because I think the board should be part of that communication to our parent community. Is there anybody who would have an issue with that on board? Nobody gonna say it publicly if I asked you tomorrow it won't be at a public meeting and we'll do the charter today direct. I will volunteer to help draft any communications that go out and I would also like to propose that the chair, the board and the superintendent send a letter to legislative leadership asking for the money when the whole delegation also included in that communication. And we can work on drafting letter talking about the the funding challenges ahead for the district. Absolutely. Also include the governor. Oh yeah. She can get it too. Oh yeah. Now doing it also too when we talk about and I know this is a dinner piece but are we setting up things so we can have legislation date down there as well and you know, please for me let me know like when I testify to make sure that the right act is asked. So I want to make sure it's clear to everyone we're asking for and also some parents that wants to participate in that. If we can kind of coordinate something like that with parents with PTA or something like that, that would be great. But I think we should have as much people that were marching and for Pat to get additional funds should be. Should have the same amount of people marching down the state if we're really serious about you know, education and funding our school. Know when we have a strong education system, a lot of the issues that we have now can help eliminate that, you know, with a healthy educational system and it helps us with a healthy economy, you know, coming after that. So. All right. And okay. Didn't you talk about any day for the board to go down? Yes. Yes. Thanks, Director. I will be sending out an official invitation tomorrow. We are looking at February 19th as a day of action. Actually have a great meeting with the district student council earlier this evening. And we've got several students lined up to come. So I'll send out some more information tomorrow. We'll invite parents as well and set up meetings with elected officials. And excellent. Be very visible in the capitol asking for these really important priorities. Is that the student day of action. So just to appreciate the board's listed advocacy items here and yeah. See to come just to highlight a few areas that there really shouldn't be controversial things like aligning community eligibility so more of our schools and students can access nutrition. More resources for early intervention for preschool age students with identified special needs. Raising the cap, which has never been done for special needs generally that create for all districts to meet services for students with special needs. And I would just ask that the board remain vigilant because the talk right now around a revised formula for state school fund runs the risk of redistributing resources without actually expanding the pie. That same caution I would urge you to be vigilant about when it comes to talk about statewide salary schedules. As long as they stay at our level statewide and they're resourced, that would be a good thing. And then lastly, we know our kids need more structural time. So the sooner the short session identifies summer school funding that'll enable us to invite students who really need those academic supports this summer we can start designing and planning programming as well. So thanks for your work on this. Awesome. Awesome. Do we have any public comments? We do have some public comments. They are in the board room. We have Isabelle Johnson. Welcome, welcome. I don't think I'm calling her Chair Hollins. And I don't see anybody here. Okay. She must have left. Okay. So we will go to the vote. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Director Students Student Director Certified. Yes. All right. Resolution is approved by the vote of 6 to 0. Next we have Next we are voting on a revised a revision for the policy and a new policy. Director Bur Edwards, chair of the policy committee provide us provided us with background information with the board in adversity and I would like to ask her now if there's any other information she would like to share before we move forward with Wobby. So one item that we have two second readings this evening and one of them is the proposed new policy the ethics and conflict of interest policy. And as I stated when we had our first reading we originally in 2017 and 2018 this is an area that we did not have any existing policy although there is state law. And so we in 2018 drafted and drafted and adopted a nepotism policy. And this is the sort of complementary policy on ethics and conflict of interests. And it really there already is Oregon Revised Statutes chapter 244 that govern relate to government ethics for public officials, employees and currently district staff and officials follow the current ethics rules. We also and this new policy is recommended to help translate statutory language into user friendly guidance. I will note that there is I'm going to ask that we not approve it tonight because there's a one small change or addition I'm going to ask to have added to the legislation. Then we will add the slightly revised language. Post it and if there's any I don't think it's not really material change but there is a section that we want to make sure that the statutory language varies slightly from the proposed policy and we want to align it so in what section is that? It's section 2C and we would be the current language says membership or membership on the board of directors of a nonprofit corporation that's taxed under 501c of the internal Revenue Code and what the proposed changes to bring it in alignment with the statute is striking or membership on and then adding the words or service in a non remunerative capacity for so the new sentence would be membership on the board of directors or service in a non numerative capacity. Capacity. I think that essentially planning means you're not being paid for a nonprofit corporation that's tax exempt under section 501C.3. So this is really conforming language. But because this was brought to my attention today, I think the best and it hasn't been posted the best practice would be just to add the language, get it posted up and we can consider it. And unless there's some sort of objection, we could consider it the February 20th meeting and then it would have been posted. If anybody has any comment on it, they can. They can comment. But we could then adopt the final language and there hasn't been any public comment on the other sections but we could adopt it the 20th at our work session where we have a consent agenda that works for everybody. Thank you. So we would not be voting on that tonight. Do you want me to go ahead with sharing the next second reading? So the next second reading is a change to our public contracting policies and. Sorry, I'm just in. This is a 190 plus page policy that outlines our contracting rules. And there have been changes, legislative changes, but also model rule changes. And essentially these changes were brought to us by our procurement team to align with the statutory changes and also the model rule changes. And they should increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our contracting policy. We had a first reading. It came out of the policy committee unanimously. We had a first reading. We've had no public comment recommendation from staff and the policy committee is to adopt them this evening. So moved. Second, any other board discussion? All right. So the board will now vote on 6835amending the district public contracted rules to address statutory and administrative rules, rule changes and many special class procurement. Voting yes on this resolution. We are approving the provisions to the contracted rules. All in favor indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No vision, student director, civic side, please indicate your vote. Yes. All right. Resolution 6835 is approved by a vote of 60 minister voting. Civic Science voting yes. All right, next we have. We have general public comments. Ms. Bradshaw, do we have any public comments? Yes. I'd like to call up Devin Ghani and I'll just make this thing since I've already given instructions or guidelines for public comments earlier this evening. Just want to remind PPS staff who are giving publicly people giving public comment that they may not provide testimony about students that could violate confidentiality protection under ferpa. This includes testimony using information that could identify students, especially in their school communities, by the by the use of direct or indirect linkage such as school grade, special education or other status. Please make sure when you begin your comments that you clearly state your name and spell your last name. Once again. You have three minutes to speak. You will hear a sound after three minutes or my voice, which means you'll have 30 seconds to wrap up your comments. We're ready. Just start my own time or two. Good evening. My name is Devin Ghani. D D E V O N G H A N I I work at the Pioneer Special School program as a therapeutic intervention coach for special ed students. I first came to this board about 11 months ago with safety concerns for both the working conditions and learning conditions at the Pioneer program. Those same safety concerns are continuing Today, unsafe work environment. Physically unsafe. As far as sharp edges, unclean spaces. We have rugs that were soaked during the freeze with water. You can see the discoloration on them. We also have lots of new staff, wonderful staff who need training. It's another safety concern. So far, when I've come to you about my safety concerns, you have not responded to me in any way. No questions asked, no comments. I invited a member of the board to come to our school. That hasn't happened. So I'm going to give an example about safety that I hope the board can understand a little bit better. I'm aware that this district hired Black Wolf Protection Group During September of 2023, a private security firm. The agents for that firm were paid $84 an hour, the expectation that they were well trained to keep you safe. I'm sure that's why you hired them. Their Instagram and their website talk about preparation being key to keeping people safe. So I believe you probably hired them with the expectation that they could keep you safe. So let's imagine instead you are a parent of a special ed student who has to make the difficult decision to remove their student from their neighborhood school and send them to another school, perhaps an hour bus ride away. At Pioneer, your student has disabilities. They have behavior needs that are severe. You're hoping that bringing your student into this environment will keep them safe. But then you find out that the staff aren't trained before they are hitting the floor. And when I say not trained, they're not even explained exactly what kind of behaviors they should be expecting to see on their first day of work. They're thrown in the room within maybe 10 or 15 minutes of the bell ringing. Correct. So no time for the teacher to prepare them. It's not the teacher's job. They shouldn't be training them. No time for coaches like me to come in and explain, hey, this is what's going to happen today. Sometimes I don't even know if there's a new staff until we're several hours into the day. People want to do their jobs well. At Pioneer, we have been asking for training, we've been asking for workshopping, debriefing, which is required by state law and district policy, often does not happen. The only way we can keep kids safe is if you prepare us to keep kids safe, train us to do our jobs, take our safety concerns seriously. Maybe you can take a look and see that. We haven't had any safety committee meetings at all this year. My administrator admitted that to me the other day. I'm 30 seconds. Yep, I'm aware this is a problem. It's a safety problem. If you're ignoring it intentionally, you're setting students up for failure, you're setting staff up for failure, and eventually someone's going to get hurt really badly. So far there have been many, many, many injuries. Really bad, traumatic injuries that students witness happening to staff and students witness happening to each other. Kids are getting hurt too. Thank you. Thank you. Pay attention. Next we have Brian Dykman. Hello, Brian Dykman, D Y K M A N teacher at Franklin High School. I come before you this evening alongside my colleagues, friends, students, parents and community members to bring to your attention some troubling changes to the courses we offer at Franklin High school. For over 20 years, Franklin has engaged students in the study of language arts by offering them a variety of thematic choices when signing up for their English class in 11th and 12th grade. However, PPS management has enacted a policy that eliminates many of these choice opportunities Options from our Catalog Students are just now learning that they cannot take Women's Literature and Social Issues, Dystopian Literature, Medical Literacy and Composition, or Social Influencing and Revolutionary Voices. Why we have not been given a reason as to why our choice English classes are no longer considered to be aligned with the district curriculum. When we ask district currency leaders and our own building administration what this means and how we can come into alignment, we are told time and again there is nothing we can do. They tell us it is the school board's policy that dictates we can only teach Advanced Placement dual credit or the recent HMH textbook adoption. We turn in syllabi every year that have been approved by the district that document grade level standards and content in these courses. The idea that our choice classes somehow are not rigorous or standards based is contradictory to what students are saying about how the courses have prepared them for college. For example, Ada Holstrom, currently a freshman at Bennington College, told us, I believe that women's literature and social issues sets me up for success in college. This class showed me how to look at literature through various lenses, including a feminist lens, which I currently practice in my college academics. Our choice classes are among the most racially representative classes we offer. Data provided by our vice principal attached to this testimony captures that our choice classes are more likely to be racially representative of our diverse student body when compared to our Advanced Placement dual credit offerings. What is perhaps most upsetting is that this decision was made without parent, student, and community input when Franklin English teachers attempted to reach out to parents about this issue. We were given an administrative directive to not use synergy to update families on the courses we are no longer in offering at Franklin High School. This makes it feel like district leadership actively does not want families informed about these changes. We urge the school board to step in and stop school leaders from eliminating these choice classes. We ask you humbly, what can we do to show you these courses are aligned with our curriculum adoption? How can we. How can we keep courses like women's literature not as electives or dual credit courses, but as core language arts courses? We urge you to come visit our classrooms and come meet with us. We have more data to share and much more to say on the nuances of this decision. We'd like to give the last word about our choice classes to a former student, Brennan McConnell Greiner, currently a senior at UCLA. I would put women's literature on par with my AP courses. I feel very lucky to have taken the course. Thank you. Thank you. And we look forward. I'm sorry that we cut off that student voice, but we look forward to working with you to talk about saving our choice class in the future. Thank you. Beauty as Salam okay. B E U T E E Be yourself to everyone everywhere. Peace, blessings, love, light and enlightenment. Family. I'm here to send a clarion call to the community. A community. A call to all parents, guardians and every other responsible adult who's both deeply and personally invested in the education, cultivation and elevation of the children we are helping to raise around the Portland Public School system. I also send a call to every educator, mentor and loving adult who have tirelessly dedicated their time, energy towards actively and intentionally breathing life into our children as they travel along their individual journeys of growth and development. First, I simply want to say thank you. What I need you to know is that I'm right here in the struggle with you. So I know that you know and fully understand the depth of the well of gratitude that I have for each and every one of you and for those of you, for those who came before you and inspired you and supported you to do all that you do, even when it feels like the hardest thing. But you continue to push through because you know that it will be as it has been, the most rewarding thing that you will ever have the honor to do. 1844 Peter Hardman Burdett's lash law is included in the Is included in the first anti black law limiting slavery and excluding black settlers. 1847 Ralph Wilcox, first teacher and doctor in Portland. 1849 and shall not be lawful for Any negro or mulatto to enter or reside in Oregon. 1851 Portland Public Schools was first established established. The early public schools were met with some criticism. An editorial in the Oregonian July 3, 1852 stated that the common school council was self called self elected that voted $1,000 in addition to be paid of our citizens for pedagogying some dozen or two children. 1857 the third anti black state law prohibits blacks from being in the state, owning property or making contracts. This is probably not news to many of us, but please know that I have filled notebooks of research and with information in preparation for these few minutes before you today. And yes, the powers that we have allowed to be continue to now pacify us with the illusion of inclusion. Putting black names on buildings. We finally have people of color on the school board and your votes helped seat our current school board members. But who hand picked and groomed the folks who got on the ballot? Better yet, who funded their campaigns? So to who have they truly pledged allegiance? And to whom do they feel they owe? And to whom have they shown loyalty? Who is it that they are bound to serve? You and I as the community? Ask the community of multiple DLI students who were silenced last month. Ask the Tubman community of families. Ask the community members who just caused this meeting to be relocated. Let's start anew. Protecting the liberties of others as well as our own. Educating ourselves to be our very best. Actively listening to others to understand, not to judge. Choosing to give grace. Extending ourselves to others with no ulterior motives. So again, I send this call to all of us who want peace to rise above pps. And so, my fellow Benson Tech brain brother, Gary Hollins, my sister Michelle. I honor your words you so eloquently shared at the beginning of this meeting. I invite you and your entire consortium to continue to move over to the right side of neither her story nor history. But for us to be completely honest about where we are at this moment in time, we now must, as we've continued to unearth some ugly truths. I'm just asking that we as a community write a new narrative. Our story for all of our babies to walk. Forge mutual benefit and rooted in common unity. Thank you for your time. Thank you. And lastly, Robert Schultz. I think that's it. That's it. Yes, that's it. He's not here. All right, you indulge a little bit. I would love to move a thing around. We can talk about the Levy referral discussion first and then go to the implementation of the language and our experiment is that. Okay. All right. So next we'll discuss a referral to a local option levy to continue when teachers and classroom supports. After tonight's preview, we will both informally refer to the February 20th meeting. Superintendent Carrera, would you like to introduce this topic? I know. Discussion about. All right. It. Thank you. Okay. Lisa Merrick. I'm the senior management, government relations here to to discuss the local optimum levy renewal. I'm joined by Young Lee, interim Deputy Superintendent of business and operations in a supporting role. You go to the second slide. So just for some general background information about our local option levy, PPS has had a local option levy since May of 2, 2000. This was in the wake of the Measures 5 and 50 property tax reforms, and a lot of school districts were grappling with the sudden loss of revenue. The levy was first approved at a 60% rate by at $0.75 per $1,000 of assessed property value, which has since grown a lot over the years. In November 2019, which is our most recent recent local option levy renewal, it was renewed by 77% of the district's voters at our current rate of 1.99per 1000 assessed. Similar to a lot of districts across the state, we know that we have a state funding challenge, and so a lot of local school districts look to these local option levies to supplement those dollars. In our case, we've been able to fund over 800 teaching positions over the last five years in order to continue the levy and sustain this level of funding for the next five years. We are recommending that the board refer the renewal to district voters for approval, and we recommend that the board do so at the May 21, 2024 primary election. And this is in alignment with what the levy committee proposed last year. Go to the next slide. As you can see, these two charts show the fiscal impact that the local option levy has had for the district. You'll notice on the left side, that's the revenue we've received over the last five years of the local option levy cycle. You will notice a dip in revenue in the 2023-2024 school year. There was a lot of reporting earlier this fall about the pluming value of commercial real estate in downtown Portland, that the downtown property accounts for about 15% of Multnomah County's property. So that dip has really impacted our tax base. But when we're looking at the projections for the next five years, we're hopeful that the city is moving in a more positive direction, albeit slowly. So we are projecting out some slight increases over the next five years. As I'll just make sure understand correctly, this is a Monoma county tax that is used to help offset the lack of funding that we getting from the state. Okay. Yeah, it's actually just pps, PPS boundaries, but we do get, we collect a lot from that. Gotcha county, including part of the downtown area. There are also small portions of Washington county and Clyde's county that we also collect the same levy on, but the great majority is from very small areas. I just want to comment on what you just said, Lisa. It grows very slowly and we're certainly not going to do a property tax deep dive here. But it's interesting to know that even with projections of property, overall property, you know, values going up because of compression because of measure five, because of limitations, that those increases are not keeping up with wages, which means that the number of teachers keeping that current rate, the number of teachers funded by it will continue to drop over time. So that's sort of reality of having a local option levy. And again, there's lots of, you know, potential reforms we could do that would help with that. But it's just, just it's good thing to know for voters. And to your point, I think we've also projected that, you know, because of the PAT contract and higher expenses for paying for our teachers, we're now going to likely fund about 750 teachers with the even if we renew at the same, at the same rate. May I just add one point of information on the, the figures on the right hand side and actually the last figure on the left hand side is also a projection. So these are, these are all forecasts and we are in the process of trying to get the latest information, especially from the county economist. And there is a, there's a chance that we may have reason to shift some of these projections between now and your action, your vote on the 20. So we're hoping to have a meeting with the county economist this week. So there's a chance that some of these and to be clear, the projections don't matter. The tax rates matter. So the projections are important for, you know, just transparency collects what it collects. I mean, I think you answered my question partially about the projections that they're coming from the Multnomah county. Is that, is that the assumptions going into the projections come solely from there. Are you also looking at real estate data? Well, the projections that are underlying these projections, I should say those are based on our sort of internal estimates of the increases from year to year. So on the right hand column. Each of those each year is 1.13% higher than the prior year. So we hope that will prove to be conservative and the actual numbers will come in higher. But because of this unusual dip, it usually there's, there's a, you know, 3% or so increase each year in the historical trends. And so what was a, you know, an unwelcome break in that pattern was, was this year that we're in so actual, not, not even keeping flat, but actual decrease. So. So that was, as Lisa said, a result of this market depression in assessed values in the commercial property sector. So we feel like we need to get more expert opinions as much as we can from the county to restart our understanding of what they're projecting. So are the numbers on the left then, are those based on historical data, the 1.1% a year? And that's considered kind of a conservative. The first three, those numbers could be adjusted once we know more. Right. The first three numbers on the left hand side, those are actuals. So those are, those are official. I'm sorry, I got left. My left and right. I have left. Right. Dyslexia. I meant on the right on the right hand side. Those are projected out using historical trend line. Right. And those could be adjusted once, you know, more. Right. And certainly they'll be adjusted, as Director Scott said, once the actuals come in each year. But we have to. For the various documents that you'll vote on and that will be filed with the elections department showing estimates of revenue collected and the number of teaching positions that we estimate that BO member will support each year. We have to make projections and they're not binding. There's not a penalty if the actual amounts vary from what was projected. But we do want to be as well informed as we can. So that's. Yeah. And my only caution. The estimates are wrong. They will always be wrong. Okay, so. And I think I just, I just want to be clear. And that has nothing to do with your skills in forecasting. Property tax forecasts are based on individual houses and whether you're assessed value, how close it is to your RMV prob. X letters get compressed first. There's no economist in the world who can, who can project even, even one or two years out, but certainly not five with any level precision. So. And even if these are. They don't agree. These are excellent estimates that will, that will be wrong. Which is why the most important thing is the rate, which is 109. We will collect what we collect if we. And even if we saw great. My point was even we saw great property tax, property value growth, the district may not benefit from that because of the way that local option levies are compressed first because they're outside of the measure 5 caps. And so again that's even not that we're not even talking about the state cap now. We're talking about Measure 5 issues that could also be reformed if the state wanted to. You know, you could take local option levies out of the measure 5 caps or a vote. But you know, that would be a tremendous, you know, positive change. But I'm sidetracking. Yeah. So then will we be conservative in terms of the numbers of teachers for that? You know we, we, in the last levy, I think we said we would fund 850 to 900 teachers. And so with these changes then are we looking at funding fewer teachers by the end of 2030? How do we come up with that number? So the, there's a little note at the below each table and the, the 2019-2024 Levi says has on average funded 800 teaching positions. And the number on the right hand side looking forward is 750. And that's one of the numbers we're going to kick the tires on too. But basically the reason for that being lower is that the salaries and benefits for each teacher are increasing more quickly than this revenue source. Yes, makes perfect sense. So it will have to be unless these projections end up being really low and we see really rapid growth rather than kind of a very modest growth in the levy collected. That's not really what we expect. Expected to be sort of slow, slower than increasing competition. Thank you. Other questions. You're not done with this? Yeah, we have a few more science. If there's any other, any other questions on the fiscal projections. Okay, we can go to the next. And for additional background information, we also have a statutory limit imposed by the state on how much school districts can revenue. There's three tests and it's the least of those following options which is a Sandra mentioned the, the measure 5 limit on each property, 25% of the total received by the district from the state school fund formula or $2,000 per district extended weighted average daily membership increase each fiscal year 3%. And then any amount collected above that limit is then deducted from the state school fund grant. And the limits that is projected for next fiscal year is $123 million. And so at this moment in time with the projections we have, we're not expected to meet that limit. If we do Refer the levy Referral the same $1.99 per thousand of assessed person property value rate. So we're not expected to meet that limit in the life cycle of this levy. However, if we do increase the local option rate, we would be likely to meet that limit in that five year period. And so we would require state action to either increase that limit or remove the cap or go in some other different directions where we could still. So we want to make sure we're monitoring that over the next five years. But if we do refer this at the rate that we currently have, we will not hit that. We can go to the next slide. The district was able to do a survey of likely May voters and as you'll see from the chart, the what the chart shows is that voter support for each levy options at three points in the survey. You can see the percentage of individuals that support the renewal, the 25 cent increase and the 50 cent increase. As you can see, the renewal does have the most support. And if you have any questions about the different questions that were imposed on the survey, you know there were different information provided for each ask. But we are very it's very clear that the renewal of the current rate has received most support from likely new voters. And just some key dates and deadlines we want to keep in mind as we move through this March 1st is when we do have to provide a notice of ballot filing title due to the Multnomah county elections office. March 21 is when we have our measure filing deadline. May 7 is when we would have a tax supervising conservation commission, the TSCC public hearing. And then May 21st of course is the primary election and that would be the date that this referral would be on the ballot for. In order to follow those deadlines, we propose this evening's board meeting and discussion about the levy referral Followed by a Feb. 20 board vote on the referral that we can also provide notice to the TLCC about our plans to refer this to the ballot and then we'll move forward with providing all the materials to the Multnomah County Elections Office. Questions about any of those statements. Okay, we can go to the last slide. Given all of that information, staff is recommending that the Board of Directors refer the local option levy to voters to be considered in the May 2024 primary election and maintain our current rate of $1.99 per 1,000 assessed property value. Again, this aligns with the the levy Committee's recommendation. We also proposed some additional action steps which I'm happy that the board is already working on. We did just unanimously approve the legislative agenda which includes asking the state for $41 million to bridge the shortfalls in our upcoming budgets. And I think looking even past this session we can ask for additional funding to meet the quality education model, participate in some of those other opportunities that I highlighted that the governor and legislature convening including talking about what kind of adjustments we can make to the state school fund formula and then of course the legislation to remove or lower them on our local. So we do feel that this is the best path forward where we will get the most support from our voters and maintain this funding that we have and also look to opportunities where we can increase funding. Great. Any other questions? Just to summarize the referral of the local option renewal which will not race the rate is one measure that we can take over the next several years including several additional ones. Legislature that went here as part of the way to build back funding whether it's increasing the state school fund, changing the state funding formula and then our voters as they usually have supporting us with local options. But it's not we pass the local option remove renewal and that solves. Yeah. Time for comments. Yeah. Can I go for it? Actually keep going. So the other thing is I just want to clarify is that just because we decide to go for renewal now does not mean that if we have are successful legislatively of changing the rules around the local option doesn't mean we couldn't go out in the future to with a new ask to provide additional supports. So it would basically we're locking in this base. So the other thing I guess I want to just add to the slide that had sort of boards the board's action and it may have seemed like it stopped at the 20th of February but I guess I this is my pitch to my fellow board members that really once the district files the paperwork with the secretary the elections office for the renewal then it's really our job to lead and be the advocates for passage of the measure. And just background ways in which you all will be expected and hope you will enthusiastically raise your hand to support helping secure endorsements, raising money, speaking to school and community groups. We are going to be engaging Jeremy Wright who's run the ran the 2019 local OPTIM levy and also the 2020 PPS bond measure to be the lead consultant. And I wanted to share appreciation for the fund for PPS for an early significant commitment to the campaign. But we are going to need like all hands on deck for the board to pass this in it's 15 weeks until election day. So in about you be ready for the ask for your. Your help because once it goes to office, it is sort of out of the district's hands to be the advocates. And it's our job to get it over the finish line with our community. Is there time to lower the voting age between now and then so students can help out? That is a. I would love to see in the long term. I think this is an important conversation tonight. Thank you. And. And there's some new information which I think is really important. I just want to put it into a little bit of context. We as director Medwards said this levy is. It's essential to the district and. And the continuation of levies, essentially the district. One of the things that came up over the last more than a year was this question of if the state is not going to adequately fund education, do we want to do something at the wrong. And we were actually thinking about this and we actually, in the last legislative session put forward a proposal that would have either lifted the cap or allowed us to keep more of the revenue. And the state legislature did not pass. It did get a hearing, which was nice, but obviously not nice enough. And then after that legislative session, you know, we obviously had the teacher strike. And as part of that, we heard from our community a very strong desire to support the school district with additional funding. Obviously, the bulk of that needs to come from the state. But there was conversation about what can we do locally. And the reality is, because the legislature did not increase that cap, there's not a whole lot we can do. We looks like we're going to now because of adjusted property tax values, we're going to stay under the cap with this renewal. But as you mentioned in the slide deck, if we were to increase it, we would be running either dangerously close to or above that cap. And so I think that's a. That's a key fact that I really want to just stress for the community that there's that reality that the state limits what we can keep. The other really important piece is what we heard from the public. That's something I've said all along that I am very interested in potentially pursuing an increase in this levy, but I only want to pursue an increase in the levy if our local voters are going to support it. And there's a little bit of a chicken and egg there in terms of how do we build that support. You go out for a campaign, you build trust. How do you build that? But it's not there right now. And the reality is that I think given those poll numbers, we would almost certainly. And that would be very, very bad the district. We need to keep this existing levy and at the existing rate in order to avoid catastrophic cuts. So all of that has led me to support the staff recommendation to move forward at the existing levy renewal and push really hard for it. As director said, it is a different environment than it has been in. We know that our community supports our schools. We know they support our teachers. That's what this money goes for. So I'm confident. But it's still going to take a campaign. It's still going to get the word out. It's also an opportunity to build on some of the conversations from this last fall and talk about, okay, this is. You actually said it better than I can directly. In other words, it's a way to. It's one piece of getting this renewal doing what we're doing at the legislative session and we can come back and revisit this in the future. So I can imagine some, some of our community might be a little frustrated to say, wait a minute, why aren't we going out for increase? Why aren't we, you know, using this to lower class size? Why aren't we doing these things? And it's laid out some of the risks of that. But what can we do to build support over the next year, two years, so that we may be able to come back and have a different conversation at that. Anyway, I support the staff recommendation. Thanks for bringing any other comments. All right, thank you. Thank you. Voting on it. February 20th meeting. Next we will have update on implementation of the language arts curriculum. To particular please introduce this item. Well, we, we and staff very much appreciate the board preserving time as a priority to hear about how our adopt curriculum is going. So a one content area. Tonight we have a whole cast of folks. I'll let them each introduce themselves as they speak. Tonight we're going to talk about English language art. So have our initial speakers come up, that would be great. And if you could just introduce yourself for our viewing audience so they know who you are. Wow. Pardon. Superintendent Guerrero, do you want to go ahead and kick off the. We can if we want. It seems like he seemed to. All right, go ahead. CEO Howard, you want to kick us off? Sure. Good evening, board directors and student representative. My name is Christina Howard and I'm the interim chief academic officer. I'm pleased to share the facilitation tonight with several others. So each person will introduce themselves when they. When it's their Turn to speak so tonight we are here to share about our K12 English language arts which we're also referring to as ELA Curriculum Implementation. So we are currently in year two of our K12 ELA curriculum adoption which supports tier one and tier two instruction for all students prior to our first year of implementation during the 2223 school year. It has been several years since an ELA curriculum was adopted. This is a shift in pedagogy and instructional approaches to ELA instruction and as a reminder, during our initial implementation years we want to see teachers using the adopted materials and working with their colleagues and professional learning community to understand the new approaches to teaching and learning in the classroom. We are looking for materials in student and teachers hands and teacher pacing as we move to deeper levels of implementation. In leaders years we are looking at the integrity of implementation as teachers become more and more familiar with the curriculum and engage in more learning together, the integrity of implementation should increase because we are in one and a half years into the adoption. The data we will share tonight really focuses on the earlier stages of curriculum implementation similar to the math presentation we gave about a month ago and the usage of the curriculum. We also want you to know that we share your same sense of urgency and that when we are doing something new it takes time and opportunities to learn. I would also like to remind us of our why in our Roadmap to Educational Equity. Within the roadmap, we are focused on high quality instructional materials for tonight. You can see our agenda on the left and we will close out tonight with any questions you may have. So we're going to start off with K5. I'm Emily Blasco. I'm the senior director for PK5 academics in our office of Teaching and Learning. As our team shared on January 23, the 202223 school year was the first year in which our K5 Tier 1 or Core ELA curriculum was fully alerted to science of Reading Research. The components of this curriculum are listed on this slide. The first three explicitly help our youngest students learn to read. I saw terrific Hegarty and Foundations instruction at Rosa Parks this morning. I saw kindergarten students practicing reading with their eyes closed by blending together sounds like is MA or take off them is act And I saw second grade students using letter tiles to tap out and practice spelling tricky words like clothes and grades. Every day in our K3 classroom, students spend 120 minutes learning and practicing these isolated reading skills and then applying them to books. In both our English and our DLI classrooms. We integrate English language development supports into our four ELA blocks. In our first year of implementation, which was last school year, our learning walks revealed that 84% of classrooms were using our adopted ELA core resources. From spring 2022 to spring 2023, our aggregate OSAS scores in ELA stayed steady at 57% proficient. I want to remind the board that these scores represent only end of year performance in grades 3, 4 and 5. Our kindergarten through second grade students do not take OSAs. As you can see on this slide, most racial subgroups also remained at steady levels of performance with a small increase for Latino students and a decrease for native students. We continue to see a significant racial gap in our aggregate scores and this is the need we're focused on addressing with our ongoing and new investments in early literacy. And thank you for the approval to evening. Excited to get going. I'm going to pass to Joanna for six eight. All right. Thank you Emily. I'm Joanna Tobin, Senior Director for Middle Grades for Academics and Redesign and it's a pleasure to share with you tonight about 68 though our adoption is really 612 so you'll also be hearing from Philippe. Our adoption is the Houghton M. Flynn Harcourt or HMH Intro Literature. We are in our second year of implementation. This curriculum uses texts that connect students lives, builds confidence and really builds mastery of the standards in support of the College and Career readiness Standards to talk a little bit about the college and Career readiness Standards within the Common Core State Standards. This includes three key complexity, evidence and knowledge. So complexity refers to practice regularly with complex topics, text and academic language. Evidence is grounded in reading, writing and speaking in the evidence of the text, both literary and informational. And then knowledge builds knowledge through content rich nonfiction. So in order to reach that full demand of a standard, it really is that full package of those three areas. And so when we talk about implementation so far our principals report based off of some feedback this winter that approximately 69% of middle school comprehensive middle schools are regularly using the HMH curriculum. And at KH 63% the middle grades team has been engaging in implementation walks in both our K8s and middle grades. We're calling this our phase one, really getting in there, seeing what's happening to better understand current implementation. Phase two we're really looking forward to which is on site additional professional learning. We have a teacher survey ready to launch this week that will help tease out some of those needed pieces from teachers as we continue to implement. And as you can see from our data on the right, our effort in this professional Learning on site is really addressing the urgent need we share with you the urgency around this data and the data that's reflected on the right really moving into that site level professional development so that we can really look specifically at student data with teams building upon the PLC work. And with that I will pass to Saleet for 9 12. Thank you for the opportunity. Senior Director for High School Academics. You heard a little bit about the HMH curriculum? I'll share a little bit more. At the high school level, the curriculum includes a range of grade level diverse and teacher selected texts. For example, the very first unit of the 9th grade curriculum includes texts from Langston Hughes, Samira Ahmed Angelou. In 10th grade, students are exposed to the writing of Dr. King, Malcolm X, Colson Whitehead and Chimamandan Ozi Ampiche. The curriculum includes writable, which is a digital platform that enables students to receive timely and focused feedback. While the curriculum provides teachers with a common and comprehensive foundation of relevant resources, it is it also has flexibility for teachers to refine and adjust as appropriate to meet student needs. It's worth noting that this curriculum is used by more than 1500 school districts across the country, including over 200 school districts that are as big or bigger, as diverse, if not more diverse. At this point, 40% of our high school principals report consistent use of the implementation of the HMH curriculum and 30% indicate that there's consistent use of the assessments. Our student course passage rates for English language arts are really high though we do see that we have racial achievement gaps that need to be addressed. Happy to report that 7,400 students high school students are enrolled in upper level English courses and that 2000 of our students are currently taking dual credit college courses, high school dual credit courses. This number is increasing across all racial groups and student access and success in college level coursework, as you probably know, has been a part of our high school success plan for several years. We're really pleased to see more of our students experiencing success at this level. Yeah, so I John Franklin, Chief of Schools, also member of the OSP team we up at the dais with us Chris Frazier Senior Director of Schools, Former Principal Franklin Margaret Assistant so I'm just going to real quickly talk a little bit and I talked about this during the last presentation about math and of course we'd like to engage in dialogue questions. So the big piece in terms of monitoring following up with this is number one, getting into classrooms. There's a concerted network distinctly to make sure you are in classrooms not only from the senior, but more so from a principal perspective instructional rounds it happens every week. And so that is a big piece and that's involved OSP and OTL instructional rounds. There there's a promo practice generally centering around grade level standards around instruction. Is the curriculum being implemented or is the tier one piece which we noticed the instructional framework which are instructional priorities. Learning walks there was learning lots today and that is really geared specifically towards curriculum. And so that happens pretty consistently not as consistent in instructional rounds. Senior directors during their one on ones weekly at most they observe classrooms with principals. There's a specific template that they use noting usage of the curriculum and really instructional priorities. Like I said, around instructional framework is important as well. I mentioned this last time and looking forward to having this come to fruition. I think it's a standard of expectation in terms of every teacher has at least three to five informal observations with feedback given using a consistent informal observation tool centered upon our evaluation rubric. Charlotte Danielson and the instructional framework. We are working distinctly with ilts. That was a big kick kick off for us this year in August Instructional leadership teams which help really guide the PD for buildings. That's comprised of various members of the school teachers principals instructional coach which is new this year. Quarterly reviews happen. Chris can probably talk to you need if you have questions. He's been, you know senior directors are charged with having quarterly reviews with IoT teams to talk specifically about progress on instructional priorities. And then of course you know, then PLC's is another big piece which we feel is a distinct lever in terms of increasing student achievement. So getting consistent not implementation, but then Data from those PLCs PLCs is not getting to together to talk about field distinctly about student data, student work, what does that look like? And then they're very specific and I mentioned this as well. You know that that the use of the SKIP consistently throughout the year as the foundation roadmap for schools is distinctly important. It's not something that just sits on the shelf, but the skips. The skip showcases that we have throughout the year provide opportunities for principals to distinctly talk about progress publicly on their goals and the strategies that they're using. Then of course feedback is given on whether those strategies are working what do better in those specific cases. And I would say this distinctly, you're seeing some of the data. The first piece to school improvement tonight is confronting the facts. There are pieces that you've seen, you know, in terms of curriculum at the high school level that we are working through that we're struggling with. I think you've seen some of the comments that we've been getting. So that's, that's a microcosm of some of the push. It was different in math. ELA and I think talked about that is when you work so long without a curriculum and you push something forward. People are invested in building, so we want, we're trying to build sustainable practice. Right. And they have to believe in this and work in building capacity. And as Christine said, it takes time. So we're not nowhere near obviously where we want to get to, but we're very confident we will get there. Good evening. Jay Daniel, Chief Student Support Services It's a pleasure to be here representing our NPSS and our student support team. I'm accompanied by my colleague, Assistant Director Elizabeth Martin, who leads our academic intervention and dyslexia work across the district in collaboration with our OTO and OSP colleagues, each of our building leaders. Throughout these critical frequent presentations, questions have been posed of what happens when students are not learning or what happens when students are not at grade level. Prior to this presentation we provided you with some information about that and quickly summarize some of that here. Also for you. First and foremost, I want to share with you that we will not close the student learning gaps only through intervention. That only happens when students provided high quality core instruction with the appropriate scaffolds with intervention occurring in addition to the core instruction. If only interventions provided are only co instructions provided, the gap we didn't persist or the gap equipment. Next, I want to take a moment to speak a little bit about preparing that you see on the slide. When I talk about tier one or core instruction, we are saying grade level standard line instruction in curriculum access for all students a others. This is a foundational principle in CSS that all students receive for instruction. Tier 2 or the middle part is what is done using the core materials when students need more time within the core resources, more focus on the standard and smaller group instruction or more instruction delivered by the classroom teacher. And finally Tier three or the smallest part of it, the chairman. It's small for or even at times one to one instruction delivered by the classroom teacher or an academic interventionist to address leveling academic skills. Each step of this process is driven by academic performance data, starting with curriculum resources and then creating embedded assessments, diagnostic assessments and then moving into our map growth assessments. And finally are some of the goals as assessments. As a system we provide decision making points for our teams as guidance on tiers based on our math assessment data. When a student scores above the fourth percentile, the student's occurring at expected rates within the core classroom instruction when the student scores between 24, 21st and 39% those and they require additional course and finally when the school student scores will at 20% of we recommend a small group tier 3 instruction suggesting that they have lightning skills in the prior intervention in addition to instruction. So Elizabeth is going to speak a little more in detail about Tier 3 process with the concept I want to leave you with and we'll continue to reinforce this is strong what the core Tier one instruction is and our immediate response to Tier two needs the fewer students that are required to three year mention. We have substantial urgency in addressing the learnings of our students right now and I've shared data with you showing we're having success doing that right now and at the same time we're not going to intervene our way out of this issue without also addressing high quality evidence based materials and the capacity of our student facing practitioners to address the student learning needs. So with that I'm going to invite Elizabeth Good evening directors. I'll first speak to the right hand table here. Tier 3 intervention is intensive. It's delivered in a small group and it's dedicated to student needs. It's guided by diagnostic assessment that Chief talked about that pinpoints the incentive exact planning skill didn't exactly teach him. We use evidence based curriculum materials for intervention that are aligned to our Tier one resources and we track the progress. An intervention cycle at this level of the intensive support can last eight or more weeks. The goal is to address those skill gaps while also maintaining the Tier 1 standards based delivery of those materials. We adopted the intervention for a student in elementary school happens during the what I need that can be delivered by the general educator or an instructional specialist which we saw that current staffing level of 38:19 in middle school and high school. This happens during an academic mix support course or section. This highly systematic process, all the data, all the entry, all the collection and the guidance is overseen by a school's intervention team sit that team is supported and trained by our NTSS department. We are moving and you'll see an image in the bottom right hand here of this slide to centralized data collection supported through synergy. Some schools have already began. We can see the school has a number of intervention plans in place. This team tracks the data in order to support educators on adjusting intervention extending intervention and they also look at that data to see when it's time to exit the student from intervention. We forwarded you that data as Chief Uno mentioned. We are happy to answer Any of those questions that tracked last year's classes that we had across the K12 level and it compared fall 22 macros to fall 23 macros. We're happy to answer those questions and thank you so much for your time sharing this one. So really quickly on this and I apologize if you either said it or if it's in the data that you sent us that I haven't seen with just how do how many students district went Tier three intensive interventions? Well so the thing about tier three is it's short term and so I'm a former elementary one. I had different kids usually every six to eight weeks their kids kind of move in and out. This is the reason why we now have this synergy tracking tool. So we can start to see that because that will live in the system and it will follow a student. So typically students speaking we hope to address every single child below that 20th percentile that doesn't already have a learning plan in place. We could probably get middle school, high school numbers for you because that's a push track through our. But until we have full usage of this like the elementary gradient is kind of like such a low because it's such a wide range as kids are learning to. We can get you an estimate. Yeah, we can't. Yeah, I don't need the examiners sort of cure and I love data but I mean it really. I mean not just because they're cool but they actually give useful information. And then. And then you say we sort of track when students no longer need it. So but that's also a really tracking the effectiveness of it. Right. I mean if we have students who sort of go into Tier 3 or any of these, you know, and are not sort of getting better then two do we have the ability then to take a step back? Maybe for one student it works really well but for another student it's just not and sort of reassessed what they need. And that's the sole purpose of the sids, to give them that guidance. It sometimes leads to a child not making progress that needs to have evaluation from their. So it can lead to that. It can hopefully lead to successful completion. But yeah that's really the point. And some kids can be like I said, they can be intervention for six to eight weeks. It could be, you know, two cycles of that. It could be longer and then again other information. We also look at things like attendance. Attendance is huge. Why is it attending? Does that need to be. Let me. Sorry, one more maybe asking that because again I was sort of curious about magnitude. But can we confidently say that every child that needs an intervention at these levels gets it or are there funding constraints here? I mean, I would like to say yes, because we have the wind block in place, especially at elementary. But as kids get older, middle school and high school intervention have not always, always been a thing. And that's just, that's actually a national thing. We're just starting to see a lot of data come out about the effectiveness of intervention for older kiddos. But yeah, I mean I, I think we all aspire to be at that level every single time an intervention, if it's an active need. So I think we're also in the process. And then so I'll go back to emphasis before we will always run out. Never happen. I stumbled over my answer. We will never have enough resources if we're only emphasizing. We need to continue to emphasize high quality core tier 1 and tier 2, tier 2 instruction so that we have enough resources because we'll always have some students that require intervention. And so our process of onboarding and emphasizing high quality instructional materials, professional learning is what is also going to enable us to provide adequate level of intervention resources. So the two are hand in hand. It's not one or the other. So as we're building our secondary intervention program which is being built in process because not only do we have intervention classes and support services available, we'll also have our students. I said that right. That are in ninth grade high school, we have intervention processes and systems in secondary levels in addition to at elementary. But our emphasis in the core is huge for us and because like I said and reiterated, both have to happen if the emphasis on the core. When I was looking through the presentation, they had implementation data. So this is not, I know it's not a direct correlation between high quality instruction, core instruction. But there were numbers on the consistent use and implementation of the curriculum. And high school it was 40%. And the numbers were slightly better for the middle school school 84% adoption of the ELA core resources. 85 but then the middle school 69% of middle school principals report consists use of implementation of the curriculum. Is that a measure of whether that core instruction is being delivered or is there a better measure? If your premise, if the premise is we really should focus on the tier one and the core, what is our measurement of whether all students are getting that? So these measurements here or is it something else? So these are measurements that are reported out by the principals at the secondary level. What we're doing right now and this is what we shared in the math update is that we are going on curriculum implementation walks. We're going on learning walks. I was just on a learning walk today at a middle school where we're walking together and we have a very concrete way. I think we answered this question that you were asking about. When we go into the classroom, what are we looking for? So we're looking for pacing. We're looking for is the lesson coming from the curriculum? We're looking for within Math Core Action 1 is around Focus, coherence and rigor. Which part of are they meeting those within Core Action one in ela, we're looking at our text and the complexity of the text. And so we have a very detailed way that we're looking at instruction to say, is this meeting grade level? Right. Are we implementing the curriculum? Is one question. And we're looking at that through pacing. And then two, the integrity in which we're implementing it. How deep are we getting to? Because the curriculum is a new approach. Right. And so even part of our look fors, the first two are around the curriculum and grade level and the teacher actions. We also have pieces around the student action. So how are the students discussing? Are they discussing, Are they owning the majority of the work? And so that's what we're looking for. And we've been training central office leaders, coaches, building leaders, around that way in which we're looking and walking so that we can say this is where we're at in terms of implementation. And it's taking us a while to get to every place. Right. And every we want to. Our goal is to walk every classroom by the end of the year for math and ELA to understand, not just to understand where we're at, but to understand how we're going to allocate resources and supports in the classroom at the site level with the coach, with the building leader to improve and support. So thank you. Thank you for the answer. I guess I'd written down also the same question that Director Scott had about like, how many students need it and how many students are receiving it. And I guess I have the have this like a similar question across that. And as a layperson versus an educator, and I think, as I think a lot of parents are, is like, how do. How do we know? Like, how would a parent know? Like, my child is getting their core instruction and therefore, like, that's the essential building block. And we're not going to need as many interventions because we've got that. So to me, that's what it would be super helpful to be able to see, like, how are you. How are you going to summarize all those walks and classroom visits into something that's like a tangible. Like, hey, we have 15% of our high schools or 20% of our middle schools that that's not happening in every classroom. And that's what we've just, you know, gotta focus on our resources on since we can't do it at all. So curious. Like how would we like as the board or the community understand that the summation. Great Student success committee episode watch on YouTube in case you want to stay in and you don't feel like Netflix. Right. Two hours long. It's great. I think that would that kind of tie in a lot to the talk of proficiency based standards because I mean, if you're, if you want to measure where students are at, it's kind of. That proficiency piece is huge. Right. Limitation. So I think it's like multiple things. It's. It's the walks, it's understanding where we're at there. It's instructional rounds, as Dr. Franco mentioned, which is what we're doing with other building leaders. That's a building leader piece of looking at instruction. It's the standards based grading, proficiency based grading approach that's also. We're working on building that out. And all of that is really deeply rooted in like a teacher really understanding their content and the way in which they are teaching it. Right. And so that's, those are the shifts and that's what the curriculum allows us to do, is to deliver the content in a way that is directly aligned to the Common Core standards. And it takes time. I didn't get to the last slide, but I have a. I have a. And I can, I can share the slide. And I'm like pause in the questions, but I share a little bit of an analogy about how we're thinking about it. So I don't know if you want me to close out this. And then we can open up to poll questions if you want to pause and ask more questions. Okay, sorry, I got locked on my computer. Let me just make sure I'm talking. Is there, is there value in the data for number of students in tier 2 and 3? Because my understanding is kids are constantly flowing in and out of tier two and three. Right. So it's. If they're flowing in and out, it's showing the systems working. Right. Just kind of curious. Well, yeah. What that data would show. Yeah, yeah. We can, we can give you what we know as of today where students would. Tier 3, Tier 2 is more based on what's happening in the classroom and decision teachers are making for additional instruction based on classroom majors. I mean, it starts with some MAPS course, but responding to classroom instruction, classroom curricular based assessments. So that's harder to get. That was bouncing off the questions that director Scott and were to ask before about numbers. The other question, just really quick, before you move on, hopefully it's my last question. Is there a system in place for like highlighting. I mean, because curriculum implementation, especially since we have such a huge, wonderful record of not having solid curriculum in this district, is there a system in place where we can highlight. The teachers are having a lot of success with the new curriculum and offering opportunities for them to show other teachers what they've gained? Because, I mean, that's. I mean, honestly, that's one of the best ways to kind of spread curriculum. Right. You want to share a little bit about the Whitney Wisdom work that you've been doing? Sure. Yeah. I think there's a bunch of different ways we're approaching that. With the example of our wooden Wisdom implementation, our new K5 language arts adoption, and we have four Spotlight schools that were sort of like early. Like they got a kind of extra infusion of early professional learning and have really willing school leaders and staffs. And so we've been building out spaces where we could eventually hopefully get to Melissa's over here. Some learning walks and spotlight showcase schools trying to capture video of teachers. We've also had these guided observations for leaders visits where leaders from multiple schools come to one of our spotlight schools or to a partner school and get to walk through classrooms together and look at bright spots. I was just in a building today that's talking about doing peer observation within their own building. And that came out as a next step of the learning walk that I was on today because there were some really stellar examples and they were talking about how can we just get the people in this building seeing one another. We are constantly trying to talk our teachers into feeling confident enough to be captured on video because we go out. I mean, every time I leave a note for someone, that was amazing. How do you feel about getting caught on video with that? Because there's some shyness around that sometimes. And that's a culture I think we're working on. Building is how do we get people to feel really confident opening up their doors or just getting caught and put on video so we can use it in pd because that's a great, a great strategy. We hear from teachers a lot that they want to See each other and then we hear from teachers that they're really shy about showing off their stuff. So that's a culture I think we're working on building. They want to hear from their neighbors. Not right. Yeah. Right. Doing it for a friend. Right? Yeah. To add to that for middle grades 6, 8, we've been in 41 classrooms in the last month and a half. Really looking for some bright spots. We've identified about 11ish really bright spots so far that we would love to engage with. Build that peer, open door, lean in. Hopefully we can get the filming going. Really shifting that culture and we'll continue being classrooms diving in. That's very valuable to see what's going on. And then as I mentioned earlier, survey really hearing from our teachers. What are they needing most? Right. Right now also really looking forward to this on site professional learning opportunity later on this spring. We've done the big group opportunity and now we really need to customize that. Both looking at the data and also looking at where teams are at. They're in a little different spot depending on the school and the PLC and so wanting to provide that space to be vulnerable out their individual needs. I have curious about the win block. When you take a tier 3 personal tier 3 needs, is it the classroom teacher? Are there plenty of support people who can come in and work with small groups or how is that working? It varies. Sometimes as a classroom teacher, sometimes like special educators will push in at the same time. Sometimes we have instructional specialists that are always pushing and sometimes there's multiple classroom teachers. They'll divide up into small groups and provide like somebody that do small group instruction with some small group tier 3 students while others aren't under construction. So there's different ways our schools divide it up but, but they divided up in what's a little bit. Happy to go. Yeah, I would love to do that. Yeah. What isn't different though is the curriculum. So as they just started rolling out, we developed field testing across the year to look at resources aligned to those materials. So then we're building up the entire school capacity around the same like I guess made teaching. So if it's foundations in K through 3 for the tier 1, we're doing foundations intervention and also another product in older grades. So it's the same keyboard so kids don't get confused that when they see the E card it's E. Right. You know, so we're, we're, we're being really cognizant that it's fully aligned. So then it's building up this like entire system to be locked up with the same sort of way of teaching and leaning on each other. You can change schools and be yes and sometimes our kids with tear free needs are you want me to close out this slide and then we can so over the past few months we have received questions around culturally responsive, culturally representative, culturally sustaining materials and instruction. We would like to share our approach to high quality teaching and learning with you which includes grade level standards aligned, culturally affirming, deeply engaging and data driven and is what we call our instructional framework which you have in front of you. We wanted to share a little more about component 2 culturally affirming instructions in our approach we believe culturally affirming instruction affirms and honors communities of color including their ethnic, racial and linguistic identities and develops all students abilities to recognize and critique social inequities. We are also breaking down instructional planning into the following steps and this process is the lesson unpacking image to the right on the slide. Teachers should first start with the curriculum and prioritize grade level learning. Next, they should use the instructional framework to bring additional pieces of culturally affirming and deeply engaging instruction into the curriculum. Lesson during the first year of implementation we have focused on professional learning around grade level standards aligned instruction which is component one of the framework and understanding the pedagogy of the curriculum. This year in year two we are focused on a deeper understanding around grade level standards aligned and indicator 3.7 which states students are actively engaged in the cognitive work of the lesson through reading, writing, speaking, listening, inquiry or other modalities and understanding where schools are at in terms of implementing the curriculum with integrity and also using a common observation tool that I spoke to a few minutes ago to observe instruction. We are partnering with the center for Black Student Excellence to build out culture in the classroom using our instructional framework to create a shared definition and understanding, a set of look fors similar to how we're looking at grade level standards aligned instruction right now and training and tools for leaders and teachers around culturally affirming, deeply engaging and data driven. We are focused on doing this for the following indicators 2.3, 2.6, 3.2, 4.1 and 4.6. And as I have shared before, learning a new curriculum is like learning a new and complex recipe. The first time you use the recipe you follow it step by step, you read it and you reread it. The next time you do it you get a little better and you still need to reference the recipe. By the time you've used the recipe over and over 20 plus times you have added new elements, become more familiar and confident with it and have made adjustments based on who you are cooking for while you are still staying true to the intent and level of the recipe. This concludes our presentation for tonight. We would be happy to answer any other questions that you may have. Are you offering like a maybe during summer PD time for teachers to. We have the last two summers as well. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. And then any. So any teacher. Because that is during non contract time. Right. So any teacher who didn't receive it in the summer, the they were able to go during an in service day during contract time and we posted those at the convention center so that we had enough space. So that's happened the last two years. Do we know what the saturation rate is in terms of how many buildings or educators have adopted? Yes. So that's throughout the slide deck on the gray fans, the implementation. So for secondary we have the principal self reported numbers on the implementation and then K5. So yeah, slides three, four and five. Each one of those have the implementation data. And as I shared, our goal is to get to every math and ELA classroom by the end of the year to understand and not just like we don't want to just collect this information. Right. We want to be able to figure out how we're supporting and how we're adjusting our professional learning, how we're, we're pushing into PLCs, how we're working with coaches. We also work with the coaches every other week. And so for tomorrow in their, in their training, they're actually going out in groups and they're looking at instruction the same way that we just looked at instruction today in a learning walk. So that we're all trying to be calibrated. But this, this takes, you know, it takes practice, it takes time for them to be able to understand those nuances of the curriculum and to be able to go and look at instruction the same way. The lower implementation numbers for high school, because they started later. I think I talked about this a little. I think this is a myriad of things and mind you, this is a, it is a self reported survey. And so we've had. I think it's important to note that obviously we've been through mass destruction. I do wonder if we would have had not lost that, what, what it would have been. I think it was where we would need it to be. But at the same time we're going to use this same level survey towards the end of the year to kind of see where we're At So hopefully we have a little more description and we can actually get through this whole second semester of full learning and PD and those types of things and that type of because building capacity. So I think it's, it's at the high school level in particular. I think what we're seeing are pieces of activities. Seeing we're there, we want to incorporate some pieces. I don't have all the information or learning as we go. So I think there are folks on those on that level of continuum. And so it's our job at this point to figure out where you are at specifically and what does the support the accountability look like depending on the we sit on that continuum. But I think that can explain some of those pieces. But this is a data point. But we're also looking at what are the informal alterations say, what does the learning mod data say? What does the instructional data say using that common. Okay, so I just have a lot of questions when I call them tonight. Remember I try to email how I usually get by the time I leave. So ain't gonna bank on that. So know you said that so many schools have started using the curriculum. I'm just curious on how what is the plan to increase schools and also who leads that work? Yeah. So I can talk specifically. So I would say from leading the work perspective, making sure implementation is happening. So senior directors, assistant superintendents, working with principals to make sure that those pieces are happening. From a support PD perspective, that's really where we rely on obviously teaching and learning learning to making sure that if a senior director goes and talks with the principal and principal says this is where I'm struggling. This person here that's struggling with this particular thing, this person here, I need some more tools, more specifics. Either PD individually or PD as a whole staff. That's where would come into play. So it really is a concern. Yeah, so it's, it's. It's a few things. So there's the immediacy I would say right now. And so a few things. The first is increasing clarity regards to expectation. We've been I, I think pretty clear in terms of the expectations. But it doesn't hurt to reinforce the message. I think the second piece is, you know, we are doing things that are new this year that were interrupted that first semester. So when you're thinking about the three to five, for example, classroom visits, the expectation when we're so interrupted with that at the beginning of the year, getting into classroom, looking forward to what that second instructional rounds we have learning loss using a common tool so that's going to be a big piece and tabulating that data. And what I'd also say too is we need to develop for again, getting a little bit more differentiated. So when we meet individually with principals, say specifically at the secondary level is okay, so where are you on that continuum in regards to say, staff implementation? What does that support look like? So it becomes more of a differentiated plan. But the understanding, the expectation is the curriculum is. We believe wholeheartedly that the fidelity of implementation that leads into another question. So at the last meeting, you know, it was said that support and follow ups with principals when school is not using curriculum. How does that or what does that look like? Like, can you give an example of how it's been used this year? Sure. So, so I'll give you an example if quarterly reviews, for example. So there are a few avenues to which senior directors work with building leaders. So it's the one on one visits consistently. It is instructional rounds it. And we're just completing an immersive, say quarterly reviews. So and I could. And Chris, I don't know if you want to talk about maybe an example of a quarterly review done recently which he can talk specifically around. Quarterly reviews are looking at your skip goals and the instructional priorities. And then what does your data say? Except it's not specifically this with the principal, it's with the ilt. Right. And so an ILT which is. Can you explain what ilt? Yeah, sorry, Instructional. So it's Instructional Leadership Team. And so instructional Leadership Team is comprised of not only the principal, but, you know, staff teachers within the building. And they work with ILT to really help guide professional development throughout the course of the year. And so Chris, I don't know if you want to. I don't want to put you on spot. No, not at all. I appreciate the, appreciate the question. Yeah. Quarterly reviews are just. It's an opportunity for senior directors to work with the building leaders and teacher leads relative to the professional development that needs to be implemented. So they're looking at their teaching and learning cycle. They're also looking at the work that they're being done in the professional learning communities or their PLCs. And again, it's that conversation of are, is there alignment right. Within the department, recognizing that it's an entry point that in every department everyone's in a little bit different spot. And so as a senior director, we get more information. And then outside of that meeting is when those one on one meetings that Dr. Franco spoke to are so important so we can coach and support our Principals recognizing that yes, they've got the entire continuum of early implementers to teachers that may be a little bit more resistant and it's us working with them on how do we break through some of those barriers so that we can get the full implementation. That actually leads right into my other question. So what happens when a teacher is not using the curriculum? And then. And I know there's some steps that goes with that with corrective actions and then what happens when they continue not to use curriculum. I'll let us school a couple weeks ago last week where the teacher just literally said I'm not using the curriculum. How do we address that? I would say from if, if it's that to that level. If it's absolutely to that level then we're talking that's a discipline that is. That is. It goes to that level. In regards to that like complete absolute usual to me that that is. That is despite coaching and feedback that's probably take. So a principal will have to do what if a teacher is not continue doing the work. Follow the HR process. That's the whole process that we've been through with couple of teachers. Yeah. I mean if it's like I said, if it's absolutely. This is not. There was something here. Oh you thought you mentioned the CBSE and I was kind of the CBS not up and running yet. So I'm just curious on when you anticipate a cultural partnership and form and what are intended outcome. Yeah, so we're working with. We're working on developing culture in the classroom which is part of the large project plan. That's one element of it. And so what we're doing is we want to within the culture in the classroom, we want to build out these other pieces of the instructional framework because we've been so focused on grade level standards aligned that we're looking at those specific indicators that I've shared. We're going to develop a shared definition around those indicators, a set of look for. So just similar to the way that we're going into classrooms right now and we're all aligning on the way that we're looking at instruction. We're going to do those for the other parts of the framework. And so through that process we have. We're going to have community events over the next several months where we're going to. We have design teams that consist of PAT members, central office folks and other stakeholder groups that sit on the design team. And then we're going to go and we have these community events where we're going to be showcasing and sharing our work and then getting feedback and iterate on that over time. So hasn't actually happened, reached the classroom yet? Is it something that you're going to be doing? So we're building because we're working. This is why I also wanted to share it this way is like we're really working right now in this grade level standards line because. Because we're not seeing, you saw our implementation data. So we're living in this piece and we're really specifically looking at 1.1 and 1.1 is really about grade level standards aligned instruction in math and ela. And so when we go into classrooms, we have a very specific way we're looking at that. And so what we're going to be doing with culture in the classrooms is we're going to be looking at indicators from the rest of the framework and building out those specific look fors because these are very broad and lofty statements. So we want to know when we go into a classroom, what does this really look like and how do we design professional learning opportunities that uplift those look for so that we know that's going to happen. Right. And so that's what we're building out with others and we're being really intentional about that process. And we also, like I said, we're staying this year in the grade level standards and we're in conjunction with 3.7. 3.7 is the other one that we're working on, which is students are actively engaged in the cognitive work of the lesson through reading, writing, speaking, listening. Those are the areas of focus this year. I guess we're going back to. You mentioned the cde, what you guys are doing. If it's not, if it's not up yet. I'm curious on how are you doing it? Yeah. The project plan for culture in the classroom. There are several pieces of the plan. Right. It's not upright yet. Yeah. Yeah. So mistake. Yeah. Okay. We're working on that. One component is this collaboration across offices, across stakeholder groups to uplift culture in the classroom and really define that. So that that's what we're working on. Sorry, I missed. Gotcha. No worries, no worries, no worries. Just one really quick comment. Really quick. It's kind of going back to what you said about, you know, what would you do if a teacher doesn't and kind of end up on the HR thing. I don't want to leave on that note. I want to make space for. We often hear a lot of complaints. You know, people have grace they're more likely to say something. So we often hear that. But the problem is there's also a lot of other teachers that are not speaking. One of the things that the ones we don't not speaking up are the ones that are okay with new curriculum and standardized curriculum. And I want to make space for that because it's a workload issue. Like. Like, for example, when you talk about, especially among our math world, language and science teachers, we definitely see this a lot. But like, again, make space for saying this over and over again. That like, for example, if I'm a Spanish teacher, Spanish two teacher, and I have Spanish one kid coming into my class, and they have five different teachers coming from, and it's got five different places they're coming from. That's a lot more work for. For me. Right. And I want to make sure again, make space for that. That there's positives to this and we ought to. I don't know where I'm going with this. Yeah, it's a workload issue. The goal, like the goals, it's good to have common goals. How we get there, that's up to the teacher. Right. When we talk about academic freedom, that's, you know, how we do that. I mean, obviously paying attention to competencies and best practices. But. Yeah, so can I answer that? I don't think that was a question, but you can answer that. It's a workload issue. And for us, it's also an exciting opportunity for students, for teachers to have more bandwidth to focus on students rather than curriculum development design. In other words, we're providing a comprehensive foundation of what to teach, how to teach, how to assess with the understanding that we want teachers to have a critical lens and refine. But we really want to focus on instruction. And then responding to students needs differentiating, providing multiple entry points for our multilingual learners, making sure that the tier 2 interventions are. Can also be happening. If all the effort is around developing curriculum, it doesn't leave a whole lot of time for other pieces that are also critical to teaching. So that's a little bit of a shift. So it's both a workload issue and where the deeper attention is. Thank you. Answering my non question, may I add something as well? One of the things that I think that we are also trying to do is also think about how students actually learn. Right. Because how a student does learn information is going to have to match how the teacher presents information. And right now there is some kind of misalignment there because we see a lot of standards Delivered where in many, many cases students are used to being animated. And because there aren't video games or all kinds of things all day long. So somehow we have to get them into a rhythm where the classroom becomes more of a symphony and we create conditions for every child to learn. And then the teacher has more flexibility around PLCs. Because a lot of this work that you just addressed as a workload issue is what that can be done in the plc. So what you do in the PLC at grade level is you create one lesson. And I'm just giving an example. You create one lesson for maybe all fourth grade teachers, then it's a comment upon each fourth grade teacher to look at the students that they serve. So I may have largely gifted kids, TAG kids, and somebody else may have large ESL kids. So how do I take that one lesson and tweak it to meet the needs of my kids? What are the themes that strand through so that if you go from your ESL class to your TAG class to your. Your regular class, you can still see that there is a consistency in the instructional practice and the methodology. But right now we're not necessarily there yet. And I think that's where we need to go so that we can lift everybody. Once we lift the water right. All the boats in the bay rise as well. But it does have to do with a lot of practice around PLCs, the expectations and clearly knowing your content and how your students that. I have three more questions. Try to get it done. It is 9:30. I'm just wondering if we can take out remaining questions online. We still have a consent agenda. We have union testimony. One more question. I. I'm not gonna email you, so I know I'm not gonna email. Maybe we can put on the record. Yeah, okay. I like that. So that's why I want to answer though. How do a teacher identify a student who lived experience and that was part of your culturally affirming 2.1 why you look for that? Is that what you're saying? 2.1? Yeah. Yeah. Look at 2.1 educator in account. But while you looking for that, I'm just asking two questions. How much time do we until we see results from the implementation and how does kids get into the wind block and what data the teachers use to put a Kenya win? Hold on, just put on the record. But the other one get an. The one you are asking to have answered is the one around. How do teachers know about the lived experiences of students? Is that the question you're asking? Yeah. How do teachers Identify student lived experience. I mean, what I've observed in high schools is a variety of things. Usually the very beginning of the year is set up as a time for building of culture and community in the classroom. I've seen teachers used very effectively writing as a vehicle by which students share stories about themselves. We typically begin lessons at the high school level with a warm up or a connector of some sort. And it's also about appealing and a stance and being present at events, being there during lunch, welcoming students, chatting with students during passing time. So both formal and informal kind of structures and approaches. I'll just highlight that one of our key strategies at the high school level is having 9th grade, 6th grade teams. These are collaborative, cross disciplinary teams of teachers who share the same cohort of students. So if so a math teacher, sorry, social studies teacher, a language arts teacher, perhaps a science teacher, they will share a cohort of students and a couple times a week they come together to talk about their students, talk about successes, talk about challenges, exchange information, generate common strategies for how to support students across different content areas. Because we recognize that student sense of belonging and student sense of connection is absolutely key at all levels. And that is especially true in ninth grade. So maybe, just maybe, a few of those adults have to develop relationships with students and know who they are. So if I could indulge for just a 30 second reflection before we move on. You can't have a high performing school district if there's no instructional coherence. You certainly can't. And I know when I first started my tenure and interviewed school leaders in particular, the one thing they wanted to emphasize is that we had to make instruction and just even here this evening. But I could say on a day to day basis, historically you didn't see this level of collaboration across department. We have principal supervisors observing things every day in schools, coming back and collaborating their teaching and learning team. We've only been talking about half of the pyramid. The other half the pyramid is non academic tiered supports that our students also need because they're a whole child or youth. So the combination of those three legs is what helps bring alignment across our departments. And this is a continuum, this is a journey that we've been on. You have to provide the tools and materials first. We found a way to leapfrog via the bond to adopt an accelerated fashion across grade levels and content areas. Curriculum that is itself revolutionary. We had 85 campuses, each following their own sort of direction in all of these areas. And for the first time we have a common grade level standards Aligned material. Making sure there's fidelity to that implementation is just an initial step. We have to encourage, we have to support, we have to coach. We are building communities of practice in our PLCs, in our rounds, in our learning walks. It's not just teachers that need to have an understanding of how to use the material. Our school leaders need to know how to observe, support and coach for it. We need to sort of once materials and the correct training and coaching is provided, then we move into an accountability sort of phase. You know, how do we sort of raise experts expectations? Because the material is the material. It's really in the pedagogical moves that our teachers make every single day, particularly for the diverse learners in front of them, which we know has been lacking for black native, multi emergent and special needs students. And so you know, we're trying to get a solid base of the pyramid with our tier one or we'll always be providing supports, the interventions and spinning our wheels so that that is the work that a district has to work through. And literally the convention center has been filled with hundreds of teachers on any one of these given days, you know, trying to get that initial baseline training. But it takes two, three years to do a proper rollout and get that fidelity to 95% or greater. And we have to then calibrate our school leaders by going around in groups making sure that the feedback that they give to any given teacher that we would all say the same kinds of things in the way of feedback because we all see it similarly. So I just encourage teams, the board sort of stay on this path. There aren't any shortcuts. You can't start with accountability. You got to do the materials, the training, its curriculum. It's instruction, assessment to diagnose the continuous improvement loops and then you can that accountability piece. And if you do that then you can expect to see more dramatic acceleration in student outcomes. Thank you. So highlight the thing you said, collaboration. That's huge because I mean I remember before and after NGSS there was way more collaboration after NGSS and that's where teachers learn. Thank you guys. The consent agenda. Now board members, is there any items you would like to for discussion we will set aside for next time we meet hearing None. Ms. Brad, are there any change to the consent agenda? No more members. Jo moved Dragon second. No more discussion. Any more discussion here? None. Form now voting Resolution 6837 through 6840 and 6843. All in favor please indicate by saying yes. Yes yes. Hearing that here. No. Director voting yes. All right. Zero. And then next we have comments from our union partners. Good evening. My name is Elizabeth Held and I'm the interim president of pfsp. I can't tell you how odd it is to be sitting and speaking to your empty chairs and in a nearly empty boardroom, but nevertheless, we're here. I'd like to congratulate our union siblings at SEIU for having officially ratified their new contract tonight. We knew it was a long time coming and a hard fight. We know because we've fought alongside them, fighting for living wages for our members and for recognition for longevity employees, some of whom have worked here for well over 20 years. And to our brothers and sisters in DCU, we know you're only just beginning your negotiation negotiations. We know how important your work is in keeping our school safe for our students and for the other staff who are with them every day. And we look forward to your successes at the table. I also want to acknowledge the admirable grace and continued flexibility in a year that has already demanded so much flexibility that have been displayed by staff who've been displaced to other buildings as an impact of this past winter storm. We know just as many staff have worked to express their hospitality as they welcome staff and students who've worked this past month and absorbing them into their buildings. It's clear to us that the storm has only exasperated years of under investing in the facilities at the expense of our students and staff members. Safety concerns about the fungal spores, for example, at Creston, that displaced the Deaf and Hard of Hearing program were reported long before the storm. We've heard a lot tonight about the necessity of adequately funding school and this is of course very important. You can't pour from an empty cup. But what's just as important is continuing to work to prioritize the funding that we do have. Our staff, our students and our communities deserve safe working conditions and safe learning conditions, physically safe buildings, safety provided through adequate training and safety and adequate staffing to be able to provide the services that our students need. Thank you. Hi again, everybody. I just wanted to come up here, express support and for Elizabeth and everything Elizabeth said. I totally agree with all of that and once again I feel like it's my duty to point out that it is after 9:30. Your union partners have to be up usually around 5:00 in the morning. We've mentioned this multiple times and it seems we're getting the message about how you feel about our partnership that we always end up at the end of the board meetings. So I will leave you with that. Thank you. Have a good night. Thank you. I just want to thank you for being here tonight. And I want to note, I also find it odd that we have to be virtual. And I. I think it's unfortunate that a small group of people were so intent on shutting down both our ability to hold our meeting, but also our ability to hear from you in person. So thank you for staying and testifying, and I wish. I hope next time we can do it. All right. Any other boards they missed? All right, we are there.
