C: So we're going to dive in. We are trying to accomplish two objectives this evening. One is to give you an overview of PPS Early Learners programs. There's been some significant shifts in the last year and we want to make sure you're aware of those. And then we are also going to kind of. So we're going to start big and then we're going to go narrow and we're going to do a Head Start board training for you because you also function as the governing board of our PPS Head Start program. And we want to make sure that you understand what that means, what your responsibilities are. And that's actually a performance standard that we have to do that with you annually. Some of you have done this many times already with us, so we tried to mix it up this year to make it interesting.

start time: 33:05:40.000
end time: 34:11:32.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Well, I was wondering, we don't have a board liaison this year and I think that that might be a good.

start time: 34:11:56.000
end time: 74:46:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Thing to bring back. You think about it for sure if that's something that helps on your end. So we'll go through the information we have here. We probably have 25 or 30 minutes worth of content. If something is burning and you want to clarify it, feel free to ask. We also have time for questions at the end. Here is our kind of agenda for the presentation. Again, we're going to start with early learner kind of pre K program overviews. We're going to talk about our recent reorganization, funding, enrollment, some of our program priorities and then we'll be Head Start board training. That's really going to focus on leadership and governance of the program. I just want to call out on this slide. What you see is an image. I know it's hard to see, but we wanted you to see the scale. These are all of our PPS pre K educators together for pre service this year wearing their amazing early learners T shirts which you will all get one of soon in the pony. And it's just sometimes helpful to see the scale and scope of how large this body of people is in pts that support Pre K. It's really, it's a massive and exciting group. So let's dive into our overview. There is quite a bit new in school year 2425. So I want to give a little background to why that is and then tell you what's new. So again, especially for those of you who have been working with us for longer, you may remember that historically we had PPS Head Start and then we had the PPS Early Learners department. And they were connected, but kind of separate, parallel entities. And Head Start classrooms functioned differently than other PPS pre K classrooms. That is no longer true. And we have been working, I would say for several years toward a point where we could say that every pre K student and family and PPS is getting the same high quality experience. And we are significantly closer to that today than we have ever been before. We made some major shifts in the last six months as a result of the factors that you can see on this slide. So last year, like everyone, we were facing significant budget constraints and uniquely so because all of our programs are granted and we're almost all people. When our people get more expensive, our grants get way more tight. And so we had a two and a half million deficit just in early learners last year that we needed to account for.

start time: 74:48:10.000
end time: 75:02:26.000
confidence: 1.00
F: What was the deficit?

start time: 75:02:58.000
end time: 75:26:58.000
confidence: 0.83
C: $2.5 million.

start time: 75:29:54.000
end time: 75:45:22.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Good evening.

start time: 75:47:46.000
end time: 113:57:00.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Good evening. We also were facing some enrollment challenges and we've been since COVID working to make sure that we're meeting our enrollment targets. These are grant funded slots and we want to make sure and we're obligated to make sure that we're filling all of them. And then like I said earlier, we've sort of we've been for many years now learning about strategies for aligning program supports and services, like learning about how do we become one high quality program inst of several and so we spent the last six months or so reorganizing around this central question that's on this slide. How do we effectively and efficiently maximize pre K access to the same number of PPS students and families? We did not want to reduce in any way access to our community with reduced programmatic resources. And we feel like we've really, like, met that goal. It's been challenging these guys a lot. We've been through some growing pains together. But here's what's shifted in the last year. We are now one early learners program team that manages and supports all PPS pre K classrooms. So regardless of funding streams, we are one program wrapped around one high quality program. We now have a year round coordinated enrollment process. So there is just one door for families to enter who are interested in PPS prepay regardless of which funding stream they qualify for. And we now have a year round team that can support enrollment over the summer, which is really important. We are now braiding funding at most of our sites. Dana will talk a little bit more about that later. That is best practice nationally with early learning programs when you're taking grant funds from all these different sources. The more that you can bring them all into one pot and use them as efficiently as possible. Right. The more we can get out of that funding and the more we can also offer heterogeneous classrooms and programs to our students and families. We consolidated the number of sites that we served from 15 to 14 without decreasing seats. So we just moved some classrooms from sites where we were seeing lower enrollment to communities and sites where we were seeing higher enrollment. And like I said, we reduced $2.5 million without decreasing access to slots or services. So that has all happened in the last year.

G: Can I ask a question?

end time: 114:50:20.000

C: Sure.

start time: 114:56:40.000
end time: 121:29:40.000
confidence: 0.96
G: So when you say it's like one program, one of the things that's always impressed me about the Head Start, the Head Start program, is there's all these like amazing metrics that are more than just. I mean, they're like vision tests and dental appointments and like whether parents are engaged does that. Are you saying that like all those standards from Head Starts now apply to all of our programs?

start time: 121:39:20.000
end time: 131:05:44.000
confidence: 0.96
C: What we've tried to do, and I think Dana will talk a little bit more about this, is take the best of all of our grants, the highest standards from each of our grants, and create that as our floor of quality for all PPS pre K programs. So, for example, Head Start has really strong and clear program standards around health and safety Preschool for all has really clear and strong standards around inclusive practices. So we've taken kind of the best and highest quality from all the grants and created that as our floor, while ensuring that we're meeting all the different criteria from the different grants. Does that make sense?

start time: 131:06:32.000
end time: 131:09:28.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah.

start time: 131:09:44.000
end time: 132:56:24.000
confidence: 0.89
G: And then, so our report, our Head Start reporting, is it still just kids and Head Start or is it Dana?

start time: 132:57:12.000
end time: 136:56:40.000
confidence: 0.93
C: We'll talk a little more about that. We have to still report to each funder, and Dana's going to walk you through how all the funders are. So there is unique reporting, but we're working on sort of rating that internally to make that as streamlined as possible. That makes sense. Yeah.

start time: 136:58:00.000
end time: 137:10:48.000
confidence: 0.86
D: Okay.

start time: 137:13:44.000
end time: 174:35:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So this is now what our Early Learners Program wide org chart looks like. I introduced myself before as the senior Director of Pre K5 Academics. I am that in Head Start land. I am also technically the executive director of PPS Head Start. That's a position we need to have. Dana is the director of our Early Learners Department. She is also the director of PPS Head Start. And that kind of gets to your point. Director Graham Edwards of. There are certain kind of criteria, performance standards, reporting criteria for Head Start that we are still meeting, even though we are kind of doing this graded approach across all of our grants. You can see in this org chart now, just like has always been true of Head Start and our other grants, we are still a wraparound program. So at all 14 of our sites, we have a program team that supports and manages family and community partnerships. We have a program team that manages operations. We have a program that manages child development and wellness. So mental health, inclusion, physical health, nutrition. And then we have our education team who are sitting behind us. And so now, again, instead of having the Early Learners department and the Head Start program team, we have one program team that still represents and supports all of the performance areas that are part of our wraparound program. And then the kind of next level of that chart looks like this. What we've done to support this reorganization is we've reorganized this year into four pods. So all of our 14 sites sit in one of these four pods. They're largely geographical. There's a couple of exceptions where we had to stretch a little bit. And what this means is that every pod has an education supervisor, an administrator. They also have an administrative assistant, an instructional coach, a mental health provider, and a team of family advocates who support their families. And so this way, the educators and the families in each of those pods, like, they know who their people are. They know who their team is, and that team can work together, together to seamlessly support the Classrooms in that pod. They do their professional learning together, all those kinds of things. So this is new this year and is a way that we've streamlined and reorganized. I'm going to pass over to Dana from here and she's going to go further down into the weeks.

start time: 174:40:50.000
end time: 198:24:34.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah. So I think if we dig a little bit more into the data, I think it's really helpful to understand who we are when we're looking at a classroom level or when we're talking about pre K. What does that mean? We're keeping the core tenants of all of our grants of Head Start at the center, which is children and families are always our priority. We only serve within the PPS boundaries east of the Willamette. So that is where we are, our MOU with our community partners. That's our service area and our agreement. And just as Emily mentioned picture, we have about 250 people on staff within the early learners budget. And that includes our teachers, our educational assistants, family advocates, mental health administrators, managers, clerical support and program nurses. We have over 100 local community partners and agencies that we work with to support our families and support our students. If we look at the classroom breakdown, we have 51 classrooms at 14 sites. So some sites have up to seven classrooms and some sites have two. So that's the range that we would see. We have seven dual language immersion classrooms. And this year we opened our the Vietnamese dual language immersion program, which is the first in Oregon to open for preschool. We have two native cultural classrooms and one emerging Black excellence classroom. And then Egypt, where those are located.

start time: 198:25:22.000
end time: 198:43:14.000
confidence: 0.93
F: The native and the black.

start time: 198:44:42.000
end time: 272:11:30.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah, absolutely. So the native classroom, one is located at Fabian elementary, one is located at Sacagawea. And then the emerging Black excellence will be at Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Yeah. And the Vietnamese dual language program that just opened is at Kelly Center. And then each of our classrooms have the same structure. So 18 students, one certified teacher, and then two point or 1.5 support staff with some floater stuff if a classroom needs additional support. And again, that's supported and led by the fabulous team behind me. We serve 910 students at full enrollment, and that's across all three grants. And when we break down the data of who we're really serving and how it's connected to the broader vision for PPS, I wanted to highlight a few key components here. 71% of our students are of color, 43 are multilingual learners, 22% have disabilities, 14% are homeless. And we really center in supporting those families as an access point into PPS and setting those students up for breaking the cycle of predictable outcomes for those students. By looking at our data last year we went through a pretty robust process to review our data and continually try to refine what are our priorities, what is our vision for our program, especially when we're restructuring and we centered on the values of equity, inclusion, belonging in children. And we have two clear program priorities this year. These priorities align with our Head Start goals and they align to the Head Start vision. They also support Dr. Armstrong's commitment to literacy and data and they hone in on P3 efforts to try to move towards achievement of the third grade reading goals. And so by putting these priorities into action, we're making things that we're doing that were implicit, explicit, and we're focused on centering our black, native and multilingual students. Those I was just going to name them. Our first priority is instructional equity through literacy and our second priority is equity through inclusive environments. So if we break down the funding, I wanted to just spend some time understanding each of the funding sources at a high level, but we're just kind of go over some of those and how they intersect and the approach that we've taken this year and in the restructure process that Emily described. So all of our pre K programs are grant funded with supplemental fiscal support from pps. We have Head Start funding that comes both from the state and from the federal government. We have state funding from Preschool Promise, we have county funding from Preschool for All and we have city funding from the Portland Children's Levy. So we have funding from local to federal quite a range of funding. Each of the grants have distinct eligibility criteria, reporting requirements and mechanisms for support. So we are required to do very clear cut like fiscal reporting and enrollment reporting for all of the funds appropriately. So when you asked about how we break that down and keep when we're talking about certain buckets of kids, we do disaggregate the data. When we're looking at the data, when we are reporting out data, it is all disaggregated to be able to best support and report only on that grant and that grant, only the team, especially my data team and my the folks that support with enrollment and fiscal operations. We have lots of complicated, beautiful spreadsheets that help pull out the data. We also use a data reporting data reporting system called Child plus that allows us to disaggregate that data pretty easily. So we are able to report on individual grants while also keeping this programmatic view of the information. Additionally, the leadership team has worked to identify the most rigorous standards from each of the grants and hold all of our classrooms to that highest standard for students and for families. And so this is a shift for folks. Maybe they're doing something different than they didn't do before. They're being asked to do something that's different than before. But we want to put the most rigorous standard at the front. We also, as Emily mentioned, have braided our funding in all of our classrooms to most effectively use our resources and to really try to move towards sustainability.

start time: 272:12:50.000
end time: 272:16:50.000
confidence: 0.89
C: Right.

start time: 272:17:30.000
end time: 293:11:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: When we see kind of the future of where things are going, we want to be a fully sustainable program using the grant dollars that we do receive. So, for example, Brading might look like in a classroom of 18, we have nine students who are Head Start funded and nine seats that are preschool for all funded. Right. They have slightly different eligibility requirements, they have different income eligibilities. And a family would apply to that school, to that site, and they would say, this works best for us. We have a sibling that goes here or this is really close to our house on the back end. We look at their paperwork and we determine which grant is best suits their needs and which one they're eligible for. We say, great, you're enrolled. We get that family in and that supports. That takes the legwork off of families finding the right program or figuring out what they're eligible for. We're doing that work on the back end and then that also supports our enrollment reporting and all of those pieces that go into each grant. Additionally, as Emily mentioned, we know that students learn best in diverse, heterogeneous environments. That's what all of the research supports. It keeps students that are low income away from being excluded. And so taking this approach is actually best practice, complicated on the back end, but best practice for kids and for families.

start time: 293:16:50.000
end time: 293:40:26.000
confidence: 0.79
E: So different grants.

start time: 293:42:18.000
end time: 293:50:02.000

start time: 294:27:54.000
end time: 298:28:42.000
confidence: 0.97
D: No, we're really transparent about it. They mind if we are like mixing and matching dollars. We can't do that, but we can. We can say these are the seats allocated for this grant and these are the seats allocated for this grant, and that's perfectly fine.

start time: 298:29:46.000
end time: 298:57:10.000
confidence: 0.91
E: They're getting exactly the same.

start time: 299:13:00.000
end time: 299:40:36.000

D: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

start time: 299:41:08.000
end time: 301:04:20.000

start time: 307:35:42.000
end time: 309:41:18.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah. So yeah, we do not have. We have, we follow the typical school year and school day of pps. There are other programs that are year round.

start time: 309:42:14.000
end time: 310:40:14.000
confidence: 0.88

start time: 310:41:42.000
end time: 313:35:42.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I mean our educators are PAT educators and our staff, you know, our support staff are PFSP staff. So we're bound by the contracts of our employees. Right now primarily I was looking at.

start time: 313:36:06.000
end time: 315:25:22.000
confidence: 0.90

start time: 315:25:46.000
end time: 315:44:34.000

start time: 315:46:02.000
end time: 316:09:06.000
confidence: 0.91
G: And like I said, I'm a huge.

start time: 316:09:38.000
end time: 316:50:26.000
confidence: 0.81
C: Fan of historics get very high standards.

start time: 316:53:38.000
end time: 319:21:38.000
confidence: 0.92
G: But I think the thing that's attractive in other places is that they have like a full extended day and it's year round.

start time: 319:22:34.000
end time: 319:33:10.000
confidence: 0.71
C: Yeah.

start time: 319:56:10.000
end time: 327:06:20.000
confidence: 0.91
G: Because it seems like the more kids we get in it's better. And if we have, I don't know, a two and a half million dollar shortfall. The Preschool for All fund has something like 350 to 400 million dollars. I'm looking to fill more slots. So I'm just curious about why we wouldn't try to optimize both our space and our enrollment.

start time: 327:12:00.000
end time: 354:40:40.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I think it's a good question. We've definitely thought about extended day and we've done some piloting to try to experiment after school programming. One thing I do want to note is when you look at this, I know it looks like there's three different programs in pps. There's one program in pps. These kids are all experiencing the same program. They're just their seats are funded through different mechanisms. And Head Start has most restrictive eligibility requirements. So it actually makes sense that those would be the hardest seats to fill because their eligibility requirements are the most restrictive. So it's just one thing to note when you're looking at this, I think another thing I would point out about Preschool for All is the vision of Preschool for All has always been that we're creating a system of choice for families. And so some families want year round care, some families want seven in the morning till five o'clock care. Some families want care that matches what their older children are doing. Some families want care in their neighborhood, PPS school because they want to start early and get to be a part of. Right. So our contribution right now to the Preschool for All larger Multnomah county vision is that we are the school district. Right. That is creating a school district program that appeals to some families, not all and that's appropriate. Like Preschool for All has always intended to be a mixed delivery system. So that's not to say we shouldn't like if we're seeing that families aren't coming and that they're saying to us we really need a longer day or we really should look at those things and community needs assessments and we always have and we should remember that we are not the only provider and that there are lots of amazing providers across Multnomah county who offer, you know, different models for different families.

start time: 355:17:00.000
end time: 361:50:44.000
confidence: 0.92
G: If we survey families, it'd be good to know. I'm also looking at just our kindergarten going rates and our enrollment and it seems like once people get in a sink of like we go to the neighborhood preschool in our neighborhood school and then you just go from the, you know, four year old preschool classroom right into our kindergarten. It seems like a very seamless way.

start time: 361:52:12.000
end time: 362:04:00.000
confidence: 0.90
C: So it.

start time: 362:53:00.000
end time: 367:51:58.000
confidence: 0.91
G: We could be maximizing and again I think about just preparing the quality of the head of Head Start preparing kids for kindergarten. And there's also resources which is unusual. So seems like a missed opportunity not to try and maximize it.

start time: 367:54:14.000
end time: 368:30:10.000
confidence: 0.77
E: Maximize it. How are you thinking?

start time: 368:42:30.000
end time: 376:04:40.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Well, if we have classrooms that we're not using or not all students who are eligible are going to be to use our schools as preschool sites with preschool for all funding so that you then have students have an opportunity in their neighborhood schools to start at preschool and they just roll right into kindergarten.

start time: 376:07:20.000
end time: 376:36:20.000

start time: 382:28:50.000
end time: 387:56:30.000
confidence: 0.90
G: Also we, we have facilities, I mean where a school system was built for 70,000 students and we had a lot less now. So it just seems like there's some infrastructure that we have that and we have a dropping kindergarten enrollment.

start time: 388:08:50.000
end time: 405:59:48.000
confidence: 0.97
C: I think over time we would, we would love to increase the number of slots we offer. Over time we need to make sure that we're filling the slots we have first and we need to make sure that our program has the capacity to support the high quality programming. Right. So there's always that tension of like how fast do you grow? We have grown quite a bit in the last five years and we're at a little bit of a plateau right now, I think to make sure again that A we can fill the slots we have and B we can support equality and then our long term vision we would, we would love to be able to offer more. We also, on one of our earlier slides, we didn't call it out but we also play as a partner in our community by offering some of our space to some of our partner providers. So we have several partner providers who get preschool for all funding who now have space free to them in our buildings so that they can run culturally specific programs or programs that they would do, you know, better than we could or should. And so there are other ways we can expand also besides taking on our own programming. And we've been even going down that road too. So that's not included in our 910.

start time: 406:00:44.000
end time: 407:09:08.000
confidence: 0.92
E: So what does the accepted role there mean?

start time: 407:11:24.000
end time: 413:46:26.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Okay, yeah. So the percentage of enrolled means that they are coming to school. Percentage of open means the number of open seats that we have still left on that grant. And then accepted means those students are somewhere in the process between we've gotten their application, they're accepted, they're eligible, and then we're just working through the last steps that we need to get them. Process of enrollment.

start time: 413:48:18.000
end time: 414:37:50.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I would add to the enrolled and take away from the open when.

start time: 414:48:10.000
end time: 433:38:30.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yes. Additionally, I think, like, just to kind of call out a couple of other pieces of the data, we have far more Head Start slots than we do the other two grants. And so I think to that conversation of like, how to utilize PFA more is certainly something that we're thinking about and utilize that funding. We also took the approach this year of like trying to approach each of our grants evenly in our enrollment process. And so, you know, there's other strategies that you can take too, right? Where maybe you enroll one and then the other. But we just wanted to keep our classrooms balanced. And we find that that actually is the most successful way to create balance across the classrooms in terms of gender or need or disability, etc. And then our next like frontier here is really around recruitment. So if we see that we still have a gap getting out, recruiting the team behind me is fantastic with like, hey, I know that this is a family that's looking for something. Let's get out in the community. So we have some really intentional site based, site based and like geographically specific recruitment efforts to fill those last few slots.

start time: 434:36:20.000
end time: 434:45:32.000
confidence: 0.64
C: Okay.

start time: 434:46:36.000
end time: 506:30:14.000
confidence: 0.96
D: We're gonna like do a brain pivot and move just into Head Start. So like, like funnel it down a little further and get into Head Start specific training. Wait, go back. Sorry, I just want to say a couple things. So the office of Head Start does require that we do a annual training with the governing body being part of a school district. You all are a governing body. So if they were a standalone program, we would have our own board. But because, because we're part of the school district, that's you all. And this training is to meet that standard. And then I just also wanted to say, at its core, Head Start as a school readiness program. So when we say school readiness, we mean children are ready for school, families are ready to support their children's learning, and schools are ready to receive children. So we really center around children growing and thriving in a supporting and nurturing environment and utilize the family, the neighborhood, and the community to support that optimal growth and development. Up here is our Head Start management wheel, which represents our approach to leadership, governance. And then each of the components that is involved in the Head Start wraparound approach. The darker blue circle is like leadership and governments, kind of like holding it all together. And then the segmented aqua rings, which you can't read, outline those different systems that we support. So that includes education, health, mental health, community partnerships, family engagement, eligibility, recruitment, selection, enrollment, and attendance. And we are grant required. And we have performance standards on all of those indicators that we are required to report out on, and we must provide those services. So that POD model that Emily showed earlier is designed to meet all of this by design. And we have teams out assigned to support each of these areas. So if we look specifically at that outer blue ring, when we talk about the leadership and governance, we have three distinct but overlapping bodies that lead our work forward. Those include the management staff. So the team behind me, that's led by administrators plus content leaders, and that wraparound team, my team. So the PPS Early Learners Department, we have our PPS Parent Policy Council. That is our parent governing board. They are elected annually. Parents come back like they're already excited to come back, which is great. But they do annual elections as part of that process. Our first training is going to be on October 23rd. And then we have the school board, which serves as the governing body and provides fiscal and legal oversight to our program. So together, the vision of Head Start is that all three bodies are setting the direction of the program, exercising fiscal and legal oversight, and then creating a balanced representation of voice so that there's diversity in stakeholder input. This is the same leadership structure, just represented differently. So while there's equal voice and while we want to have intentionality and different, different perspectives in governing, ultimately you all, as the governing board, have the legal and fiduciary responsibility for our program. That includes responsibility for program compliance and effectiveness. We are uniquely positioned because we're part of a school district. So being part of the district, many of those key activities, awareness, oversight, direct support to our program comes through the departments that are already embedded in pps. So, like, we work super closely with hr, payroll, fiscal grant, accounting facilities, et cetera. So it's through those departments that we're getting that support from you all and guidance in alignment with board policies, district policies, et cetera. There was a question that I got around conflict resolution, which again, would typically be handled at that more local or immediate level through HR or, you know, one of whatever the appropriate departments are within pbs. So we utilize those departments as part of the governance model. Is there a question?

start time: 506:33:02.000
end time: 508:37:42.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Oh, panel the green. Because we have legal responsibility. We're not going to go to jail for this.

start time: 508:38:06.000
end time: 508:47:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Right?

start time: 509:19:10.000
end time: 510:03:30.000
confidence: 1.00
E: You are like our advisory board.

start time: 510:26:00.000
end time: 510:45:20.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Yeah. So if you.

start time: 510:47:20.000
end time: 511:24:32.000
confidence: 0.70
E: If we go advisory agency.

start time: 511:26:56.000
end time: 511:32:16.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Yeah.

start time: 511:32:48.000
end time: 520:19:30.000
confidence: 0.98
D: So what we do is we come and say, here's the operating activities. Here are the reports that are informing our decisions. Here's the why behind what we're suggesting, what we're doing. And on the back end, we are beholden to everything that the school district does, what is advised by the school board. So, you know, they're working in tandem. I think we're offering. Here's what we see as the vision forward. We talk about that with our policy council. They're great advocates as parents. And then all of that stuff kind of comes to you all to review.

start time: 520:27:10.000
end time: 522:49:42.000
confidence: 0.95
A: In systems and I guess other places where the Head Start is not part of a school district, they would have their own board.

start time: 522:51:26.000
end time: 529:14:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's unique because we're part of the school district. That also means we are often negotiating, for example, you know, our Head Start performance standards with our union contracts with the school board with facilities. Right. So we always are trying to make all of the different entities work together, sometimes easier.

start time: 529:16:10.000
end time: 530:08:26.000
confidence: 0.91
E: And I was curious, too. How is the parent council chosen?

start time: 530:10:18.000
end time: 548:54:16.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Yeah. So parents, we do open houses and we recruit. We also try to get families that maybe haven't been involved in previous years to bring a friend come back again. They come. We do an orientation. So that's what's going to happen on the 23rd. We do an orientation about this is a governing body. I do a similar presentation that's family facing. And then they decide if they want to sit on the executive team. And then we actually do voting, and we vote in a board annually. That board is responsible for coming to every meeting. So they come to every single meeting. We have to get quorum to vote things through. So changes to our policies require quorum. I don't know, changes to our fiscal decisions. Last year, when we did the restructure, we had to get board approval for that. And so that's the process that they're chosen. I meet with the policy council monthly and then every two weeks. So kind of that off period. Every two weeks in between, we meet with the executive team to have them help set the agenda.

start time: 548:57:28.000
end time: 549:29:44.000
confidence: 0.96
E: So the parents can give feedback.

start time: 549:31:52.000
end time: 552:54:20.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah, they give feedback and then that executive team will lead the agenda forward. The treasurer presents on, you know, their budget. They have their own budget from, you know, fundraising.

start time: 553:01:20.000
end time: 558:32:04.000
confidence: 0.96
C: There's also some really exciting sort of education and empowerment opportunities for parents involved in this at the state level and the national level going and advocating around policy or going to Head Start management trainings if national level. And so it's a really cool process to watch again as families that are maybe just coming into our system for the first time.

start time: 558:33:32.000
end time: 567:03:40.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah, so we'll send families and they get really excited. They families got to go to Salem last year to advocate for early learner learning. We sent folks to national conferences. We had families attend the national Head Start conference that was in Portland last year. The families felt really strongly about nutrition services last year and so they led a letter writing campaign to nutrition. We had the director of nutrition come and we've seen some really actionable changes to our pre K nutrition service model this year as a result of that.

start time: 567:26:00.000
end time: 568:27:12.000

G: What does the demographic make of your parent council?

start time: 568:30:16.000
end time: 570:25:00.000
confidence: 0.94
D: The parent council almost always reflects it. Last year it reflected the. The demographic makeup of our.

start time: 570:32:40.000
end time: 572:21:10.000
confidence: 0.89
G: Yeah, you said your kids were 71%. So would you say 70% better of the parent council and our people come?

start time: 572:24:00.000
end time: 576:53:46.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yes. So last year I'm just trying to think about the folks that came. Yeah, we had a really strong cohort of families that came. Yeah, I think it definitely aligned. On the executive team, there are six families.

start time: 576:55:38.000
end time: 577:00:26.000
confidence: 0.90
C: Yeah.

start time: 577:00:58.000
end time: 579:20:26.000
confidence: 0.97
D: On the executive team or executive leadership team of policy council or five of the six were all for folks of color.

start time: 579:23:38.000
end time: 579:36:30.000
confidence: 0.75
C: Yeah.

start time: 580:22:40.000
end time: 628:32:02.000
confidence: 0.97
D: We also context too. We offer translation services. So we will. We'll have folks staff there to help support with translation during the meetings. And we find that when someone comes that's familiar for them or they know that there's going to be translation and support. That's really helpful. Yeah. Okay. So part of the Head Start model is also that we work in a five year grant cycle. So so we submit a grant. That grant is for five years and then we go through a whole cycle in that five years process and then we go to the next grant cycle. So that grant cycle allows for program planning for continuous improvement. All of the members of the governing model are part of that grant cycle. In their own respective ways. And we really think of it as like a circular process that might be similar to a school improvement process, K12. So you can kind of liken it to that. We are currently in year two of our grant cycle. So we applied last. So summer of 2023, we applied for our grant group and now we're in year two of our grant cycle. In that first year, we do what we call a community needs assessment. And so that tells us what are the needs of the community, where do we see that we might be needing to shift or change? We use that community needs assessment to really inform our restructure and how we're allocating slots across our district, for example. And then we also use that, that needs assessment to determine our goals for the next five years. And then through those goals and action planning, we develop a budget that will help us meet those goals. We do a continuous ongoing monitoring process and then a self assessment process throughout each year. The self assessment process requires data content managers to lead and then we are reporting out all of those pieces and school readiness goals to Head Start along the way. And so to communicate with you all, we have a few different modes of communication. This is to hopefully provide communication that's strong across the program and also within our different organizational roles and departments. So the first one is an automated HSES stands for the Head Start Enterprise System. So Dr. Wang will get these if they come through. And these are automatic updates or findings from the office of Head Start. So these are automated communications we get. They will always include the board chair, Emily, myself. If you get them, just email us and ask what it is. We always know. But I know that it can, you know, without context, it can be confusing. So that's one of the modes of communication. We also know if we're getting those updates, we can share them with the entire board. But those are the folks that will receive them.

start time: 628:35:06.000
end time: 629:36:02.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Email address like at. What it would come from, what would.

start time: 629:36:26.000
end time: 656:07:26.000
confidence: 0.96
D: It come from is it's HSES update. So you'll see HSES system, it'll have like our grantor number. So it'll start with something like one J dah dah dah dah dah and have our grant number after it. The second mode of communication is our quarterly board packets. Or if we have to do them more often, we'll do them more often. But that would include the director's update where I'm sharing the same updates I'm giving to families at Policy Council, Policy Council minutes, enrollment and demographic updates, financial updates, and any new policies if the policies are more than just, you know, some type, you know, some changes to type, or just some, like, you know, minimal edits, if there's, like an actual robust change to the policy, that will be noted, and we'll say whether that policy is for approval or for just review. And then the last one is supplemental communication. So any additional continuous communication that we need to share, I would expect this. If there's an any sort of health and safety incident report, we have to do any kind of information about an upcoming audit, because we are audited by the office, Office of Head Start, any special requests we have of the board, those will all come to you, all through the board office. And if there's any other time that you are interested in just coming, we would welcome you guys to come to one of our classrooms, to one of our sites. Sometimes communication can just look like having a conversation in person and visiting classrooms. So we would also welcome that as well.

start time: 656:09:58.000
end time: 659:16:56.000
confidence: 0.96
F: I would also say your Parent Policy Council is next level. I've been really impressed with the times that I've either participated or just look, you know.

start time: 659:18:08.000
end time: 659:29:00.000

start time: 660:36:16.000
end time: 671:41:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yeah, they're fantastic. I like. I feel like the. It was funny, last year, our board chair, he said to me, his name's Alex. He was like, I didn't want to do this, but, like, at the end of the year, he's like, I don't know what I signed up for, but this year he's like, did you forget about me? Was I demoted? Like, I was getting texts over the summer, like, what about me? Did you demote me? And I was like, no, I didn't demote you, Alex. School's not in session yet. He's like, okay, we'll be there. And so that kind of enthusiasm is really exciting to see from families, especially, you know, families, that this is their first time in school. They had just moved to Portland from Ghana, so it was just like, really, really exciting for them to see.

start time: 671:41:40.000
end time: 671:48:12.000

end time: 690:48:20.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Yeah, okay. Speaking of audits, we will have an audit this year, so. Yay. In the second year of our grant cycle, there is a Focus Area 1 review is what it's called. And because we're in the second year of our grant cycle, we are anticipating that this will come. We don't have a set date yet, but we have gotten notification that it is happening this year, which is totally expected. The Focus Area 1 review is conducted by the Office of Head Start. Virtually, it's through a series of Interviews that the grant recipients will provide information to the Office of Head Start on the following topics. So fiscal infrastructure and capacity, governance and accountability are some of those metrics that would include board members participation in. Our department is going to lead prep for that. We are already under preparation. We will be reaching out. That's one of those supplemental communications. We'll be reaching out to help prepare for those interviews. Our goal is to finish preparing by the end of this fall with the anticipation that the review will occur sometime in the middle of the year.

D: Yeah. So I know it's. It's those, those specific indicators, and then there's specific standards with each indicator and then there's specific questions. So we're just. We're preparing all the way down to, like, here's the question, here's the, you know, evidence, here's where our policy is. So we're going all the way down to there and we would share that back out with you.

start time: 705:52:06.000

C: This is just. They're not going to be coming for this audit. Right. This is just interviews to make sure. This is sort of a records check. Right. So they're going to interview someone from the board. I'll be interviewed. Dana will be interviewed. Some people from her management team will be interviewed to check and make sure that we're meeting all the performance standards, handling all our records appropriately. Okay. Yeah. Right.

start time: 717:29:04.000

G: Almost done. There's a lot of enthusiasm in the Vietnamese dual language community around the new preschool that started and feedback from the community. And again, like, how are we pulling people into our school system? I'm wondering, do any of the other immersion programs. I know that we have Spanish dli, but do any of the other immersion programs have preschool components to them?

C: And then the one Vietnamese right now. And again, that would all be part of that community needs assessment. Right. If there's other emerging needs that we're hearing from our community that would bring more people in to be able to access and want to access our pre K spaces. And we would look at other programs development over time.

D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We did a pretty, we did a, a year long design process for the Vietnamese dual language classroom last year. That was like the work of the year was to kind of go through this design process. Looking at our current preschool, Vietnamese enrollment of student like students. Right. Assuming not every family wants that. Right. Again, going back to that choice idea. Some families want that, some families don't. And that's what we saw this year. We felt like opening with one classroom would be successful. We'd be able to affiliate fully fill it. And that classroom is a braided site or a braided classroom. So there's nine slots. If we find that, you know, that wait list is exhaustive and we, you know, could fill another classroom, I think that would be something that we would try to plan for in the future. Yeah. And that community has been the most supportive, lovely team to work with. Mary and I have like had lots of great interactions and we had our celebration last week, which was great.

start time: 771:24:36.000
end time: 775:40:00.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Is that school readiness is always the main goal? And I can send you the. We can send you the specific arts, four specific goals that we have for that program. Yeah. And we can send the goals with our objectives as well.

E: And I noticed you talked a lot about course corrections. Can you tell me some course corrections you've made or does it really go the way you thought? Because. Yeah, I see that. I mean, we talk about other course corrections and then we never do.

start time: 780:39:36.000
end time: 792:34:50.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah, I mean, I would say some of the ones we talked about at the beginning of the presentation with the reorganization, like moving to having a year round enrollment team, for example, and having a team of family advocates whose primary and only job is enrollment was a change for us this year. And that was based on data that we were seeing moving some of our classrooms from one location to another location because of what enrollment trends were telling us, changing our supervision structure because what we were seeing as a differential between classrooms that were supervised by our early childhood experts versus our elementary principals. Right. So there are many. In fact, we've just made a lot of big changes that all were in response to data and part of this continuous improvement cycle.

start time: 792:45:50.000
end time: 797:35:48.000
confidence: 0.98
D: I want to highlight one other big change that happened. We also looked at our health data in a really critical way and we were able to partner with MESD to get a second nurse to support our program because we were seeing higher levels of acuity. So that was something that we, you know, that was where we course corrected coming into this year to support keeping.
