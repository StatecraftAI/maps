B: My name is Smith Lay L A I and I use she her pronouns. My kids have attended Scott, Roseway Heights, McDaniel, none of which have foundations. Almost two years ago I participated in a PPS led roundtable discussion about school based fundraising where members of schools without foundations discussed many reasons for reforming the foundation policy. That night we talked about the nature of individual school based fundraising, how we had seen within our own schools that it can exclude families and undermine a sense of community and shared firmness across the district. Many of us felt that there was a lack of greater understanding in the PPS community about the vast disparity in school experience. The one who sat beside me at the roundtable, Jamila Rashid, who is a Roosevelt parent, later provided testimony at a policy committee meeting and said there is no dignity in being handed a small cut of wealth your school's funds. The current policy helps to perpetuate a broad connected system of inequity including partial enrollment, balancing school closures and teacher and principal retention. This system constructs walls preventing immigration in our neighborhoods and schools. I'm talking about policy and practices that draw red lines in our city Today, it's necessary to rewrite policy that currently segregates our communities and feeds the good versus bad schools. According to the Lincoln High School newspaper's editors, performing the policy is an opportunity to see that whether our school lies in the East, west, north or south, we are connected by our shared experience of this beautiful city. It will be a shared acknowledgment that the things that make the city good for one of us makes it good for all of us. So as a member of the original Community Roundtable called together to advise on the current policy, I hope that you will move forward with option number two, prepared by PPS staff. We need a new start with new tools. Tinkering around with the old tools that design this flawed system does not lend space to new voices or better solutions. Thank you for your time. Thank you.

F: My name is Beth Kavanaugh. C A V A N A U G H she her pronouns I have students at Hosford and Cleveland and I'm an organizing member of the Reform PPS funding group. When I first gave public comment to this committee three and a half years ago, the foundation fundraising policy had been sitting at the bottom of committee agendas for a year already. As future work, every time this reform is delayed, we must educate a new committee and new community members on facts. Once again, we're at a point where if the community, if the committee chooses to do nothing, a policy that the PPS community finds problematic will continue for another year. I ask you to please set a timeline tonight that allows the full board to make meaningful change to this policy.

F: Forward momentum has often stalled because of concerns about losing fundraising dollars, but in reality, we don't know how much a district wide foundation would raise in pps. We do know that the only other local districts that raise funds for FTE do it through a district wide model and they consistently raise more dollars per student than PPS's model does. As you can see in the document I provided, Tiger Twaliton and Lake Oswego raised far more money per student than pps. Delaying change to a district wide model could just as easily be holding PPS back from raising more money. But more importantly, it delays the much needed unification of our communities to build advocacy for funding schools with public dollars. Something that would be much more impactful and sustainable from a resource perspective. We're not that far away. Today's meeting materials offers two options for reforming the current policy. Option one is really complicated, costly, and difficult to implement by offering district funds only to schools that don't fundraise for staff themselves. Parents who care deeply about and are skilled in raising funds for public schools are de incentivized to raise money. This option also maintains the division between schools that are able or not able to fundraise for staff positions. Option two, on the other hand, encourages school communities to work together to raise funds for staff as one united district through fundraising, transparency and advocacy. With a few clarifications, we support this option and ask that you move forward with it, finalizing language to refer to the full board in your next meeting.

E: My name is Eilee Dibert D E I B E R T I didn't know foundations existed until a few weeks ago, and as someone who talks at length about the things that make me angry, I have learned most of my friends weren't aware of their existence either. This is because our schools have never had foundations. Without knowing about this system, we haven't had the opportunity to tell you how we feel about it. I'm here now to be a voice for my Roosevelt community. I grew up in North Portland, I attended Cesar Chavez and now Roosevelt. And it isn't a secret to students that majority low income and POC schools like mine have worse educational outcomes, a disparity that is further exacerbated in Portland by the presence of foundations. I want to be clear.

E: Foundations are a stopgap measure. But not for the vast majority of PPS schools. Which means the money foundations raise creates a significant difference between their school's educational outcomes and ours. My school's fundraisers are limited. It just isn't possible for our families to give as much. And my peers feel this difference. When Lincoln beats us in sports, speech or any other competition, we joke, well, they have a grand piano in their foyer. By which we mean we are on the same level. We never stood a chance. So when we hear about swim practice held at a private mat club or pre sat's proctor and the Tiffany center, it sows resentment from our communities. Theirs. Roosevelt has always taken pride in being the underdog, but it is tiring to consistently have less to exist under a policy that treats us like we aren't as worthy. This isn't up to me. It's up to you. Moving away from school based foundations toward a district wide foundation will advance racial equity and unify our district. Foundation reform would send a message to students on the north side. We matter too. We matter just as much.

G: My name is Megan Murmison. As I said, I'm a parent at Oralhurst and I want to thank you for your ongoing work on foundation reform. Today I wanted to address policy option 2 as it best embodies the goal of the unified PPS community working together on behalf of all students. It's also the solution that has broad support across the district. As evidence of that support, in May 2021 we submitted a letter to Director Rita Moore and the board signed by PTA and PTO leadership across the district in favor of foundation reform. Following the McDaniel Roosevelt Roundtable in June of 2022, the district summarized the feedback as there is a strong interest in shifting to a district wide fundraising effort, particularly for staffing and other essential services that should be provided to publicly funded education. At the Community Work Session on Foundations led by Director HOLLINS in early 2023, there were many calls for moving to a district wide foundation. Our reform group's Change.org petition has over 500 local signatures calling for a change to the way fundraising for staff is done. And similarly, an open letter from our group in 2023 asking PPS to move to a district wide foundation was signed by over 550 parents, caregivers, students and community members from 75 different schools. Oscar Ponteri His January 2023 article in the Franklin Post summarized it this way, despite their opposing viewpoints, all sides agree the foundations shouldn't need to exist in order for students to receive the resources they the Lincoln Cardinal Times Editorial board stated in April 2023 Imagine the good that could be done if the banner.

G: What we've heard time and time again, loud and clear, is support for a district wide foundation, most importantly from those at schools without the means to raise significant amounts of money. But also for many at schools with foundations like mine this is where we can come together, move forward with courage and hope and unite the district under a single shared purpose and effort with a district wide foundation. We see this as a win for the promise of public education for all.

A: Item 3B which is the school initiation school closure policy. I have had an issue with conversion control the drafts and I didn't have a chance to look at the new versions. So I'm just going to wait till the next meeting. I think we're going to have a pretty full meeting anyway. So I appreciate you getting your comments in. It's on me. I just dive into it. And then the second issue is I just want to note that cross off the policies and public comment period. While the KIPIS committee did recommend and then we had our first reading of the ethics interest policy at the last board meeting we had some added language that is not necessarily significant or material, but it is a change. And so instead of approving it at our last board meeting, we decided to pull it over so that if anybody had comments on the new added language. So say it's relatively minor and just aligning with the state statute. But if, if there's no comment received. Roseanne, if we could get this on, have this for a second reading on the next available board meeting, that would be great. Obviously if we have some, if we have substantive comments that would make us want to change it or reconsider it, we could pull it back. But otherwise we could. Okay, great. Okay, so discuss those two. So the topic that is first up and I want to make sure that we get to all three of the items today. So I'm going to just think about how we devise time up. I'm going to say Director green, that's about 10 minutes and then we'll have 30 minutes for the other two topics.

Okay.

A: So no, this Is probably like a rare topic in the past we didn't have a. We haven't had one since 2018. That's fine. Just okay. Yeah. I would say like policy should just generally go to the policy committee because it's the policy committee. This has. It's a topic that there's interest in some other things besides just the changes that were made. And those are probably better to be discussed best that make sense. Okay. And we're also going to just try to point to not have successive processes processes going so they get invited to a future.

A: Thank you. So I'm going to spend just a few minutes framing up the next agenda item topic. So since I got on the board from 2017 this has been a topic and I thought today I just bring my file that's just on. On this one policy. Just as an acknowledgement of how much discussion there has been and there are really are a lot of different viewpoints within our school community about fundraising for staff. So I start with that. I also the next meeting I will resurrect the uranic committee. A couple years ago when you asked for community more community engagement especially communities would not necessarily have been engaged. We have summaries of that. So I'm just sort of bring that elevate that again. Also we did a principal survey I believe so we have. We have that and we can share that as well. And I will say I apologize to anybody for those in the community who are impatient this year with the pace of things. We did not want to move forward. We tried to sort of clear off most of the board committees meetings during the fall when the strike was going on. Just knowing that that was probably the most important thing for the district to resolve and get settled. And we are kids back in school. So a couple meetings were canceled. And then I Andrew Director Scott and I have the assignment of the recruiting the interim superintendent. And that became my focus. So my apologies for everyone for the so delay in carrying this over. But I think ready to have the conversation about I think some different options. And I posted online posted for this with this week's meeting agenda is a document that I put forward or created sort of here are the different ways based on six years of discussion of the different options of what we could potentially do. And they range from everything from nothing, just leave it as it is to a host of different kind of leverage, changing maybe limitations or creating different governance models or structures as sort of the. All the. What I think I captured the main. The main ideas have been put forward by different people in the school community. Again, there's a diversity of opinion in our school community on the topic. So I try to capture all those. And then I created two potential options. I figured I didn't need to create an option on maintaining the kernel system because that's what it is. We had for six years or had longer than that. I would say that if that were what the board wanted to do, that it should all go into policy because frankly, the one third flip split is just a memo and not embedded in policy. So that were the. That were the direction that I would say we still should think things about. So I tried to come up with two other alternatives that I do believe capture some of the most important.

H: The reason that I want to look at the. Look at the policy is I, after talking with several students from a few different. Of our few different schools and realizing that there was some interest there, and then speaking to some administrators to figure out if there's interest from the students, then why. What is the resistance in the schools? It became apparent that there was a barrier around understanding of what we could do and what we couldn't do and what was authorized and what wasn't understanding that the JROTC programs aren't for every student. And the students that would benefit, that could benefit from something like this are the students that. That want this the most. It's not going to be for every student. It's not for. And I don't feel like every student in the building should be required to. To take it or have to have to go through it. However, for those students that this would benefit for those students that would be interested in something like this, understanding that where we, where we sit now, we understand that college is not for everyone. So getting beyond the model that says, you know, if you don't go to a four year college, then you're not a success, then if we move beyond that, then what are some of the other options? And I believe what we start to look to is, are our trades, our career programs, which is why I believe that this should be housed under the careers aspects of things. Because the military is not everybody that goes through JROTC is going to go to the military. But what they learn in JROTC could lead them to a career that furthers them around their path to take care of themselves, take care of their family, and to better serve our community. And so I want us to look at this from a careers perspective and I want to see us give this the same level of attention that we give all of our other CTE programs. So I don't feel like the military should have any special treatment whatsoever. Like, like I don't want them to get anything that no one else does. I also want to make sure that we're not making them jump through hoops that we don't make any other career program or career path go through. And so by looking at this policy and by bringing this policy up, it gives our, our administrators who are interested in something like this a pathway to go down to present, to say, here is the, the rule per se that says that gives me the authority to do it. And that's what I'd like to see happen with this. Again, is it for every student? No. Is it for every school? Probably not. But should they all have the opportunity to say no? Absolutely. Should they all have the opportunity to determine whether or not this is something that they could benefit from? Absolutely. And we as adults shouldn't allow our biases to get in the way of that student making that decision for themselves. Nor should we allow our biases to get in the way of an administrator who wants to provide this opportunity for his students and his site and his, his community. So I want to see, I believe that this, this policy revision or this revision creates a pathway where we can get out of our own way and open up the door for those that want to consider this further.

A: About it when we have somebody from the CTE team who can come speak to this or answer questions we have. So I would ask. And applicants are black after this, but if you have questions, we should get them submitted. You know, just what is it new? Other schools do it.

end time: 465:31:10.000

B: This is another instance, and it's being proposed with cte. So it would be a curricular, not a recruitment. So that's the difference. So what Chris Rider will be speaking to is developing it as a CTE curricular option.

start time: 465:46:10.000
end time: 469:57:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So in some ways, I'd like to have that discussion later because I want to get back to the other topic. I think this is more just like an authorization versus, like, here's what actually is in it.

end time: 473:09:40.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Details. I have questions about. I have a lot of questions about. Well, let's. Let's do it. Could we set up time to talk or have those questions answered? Yes. I just want a little bit more research.

start time: 475:01:20.000
end time: 480:26:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So I wanted to let Dr. Green just get his idea on the table, and when we get back to that point of session, we'll collect questions and we'll see what else people want to know or who you want to hear from. For sure. We want to hear from students as well.

start time: 480:50:30.000
end time: 509:12:30.000
confidence: 0.97
H: I'd also be interested to. To find out if. If what we're doing here, if the. If the things that we're putting in front of this are this. Are these the same types of things that we put in front of every other CTE program? So we're the. And I. I feel like every. Every program should be. Have the ability to. To answer questions and, and to go through all that. So that's. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm. What I'm looking to is to understand is, are the. The hurdles that we're going through, the stuff that we're, you know, that we go through, are we doing this for every CTE program that we enlist within pps? Because if we are, then great. If we're not, then I'm. I want to know why we're doing something different. Right. So it's not about Whether or not we should. Or we should. If we. If we look at this as this is a career opportunity, then are we. Because what I want to make sure that we're not doing in all of this, regardless of who I talk to or who we talk to or who has the conversation, what I want to make sure that we're not putting in front of our young people are politics. I don't want to do politics. I want to talk about career opportunities. I want to talk about are these viable opportunities that could bring a student success, viable opportunities that could bring a school success, viable opportunities that could bring a community success. And. And so take care of a few things. I don't have room for politics. And so that's what I want to make sure that we get real clear on.

A: We can have it in the same. This committee meeting. I just want to get back to the other topic. I wanted to let. Because we could talk about this for a long time. I wanted Director Green just to get on it, to be able to, like, here's what I was trying to do. And then we'll have more committee meetings and discussions. But I do want. Because it's moved back to the agenda for almost the whole year. Is that okay? But one for sure leave.

start time: 534:31:10.000
end time: 599:11:10.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So back to. Back to the two. The two options. So essentially, the two options are maybe I'll walk through option two first and then option one. Option one. It probably needs to be. They have additional revisions. What I try to do is mimic a little bit what we did this year in which all schools had some additional resources. Because what it meant is, for the first time, schools that don't have foundations and get equity funds, had actually the ability to have some discretionary funds where they could utilize it in ways that was customized for their school community versus many times the equity funds. It's very directive of how they have to spend. And then for the schools that don't necessarily get equity funds but also don't have foundations, they have the ability to say, you know, we're going to do another, you know, half, add another 0.5. So we have a full time, you know, art person and maybe a 0.2, you know, so we have a full time PE teacher or we're going to do two EAs. So they had, they had the ability to customize things for their schools. So that is really what option one was trying to do is in some ways mimic that. And there are some inherent issues that you need to have the resources to do that. And then option two is the shift from having school based fundraising being allowed to purchase staff to move into a centralized, centralized foundation where staff could still be purchased and but it would be done at the district level. And so the money would be gathered centrally and then distributed. Pretty much the model that most other, almost all of the school districts use it, they have private fundraising. In addition, both of these policies tried to capture other issues that were raised over the last six years. So I'll just talk about the registration. So we have an understanding of who's raising money. There is, you know, donations are being made to the schools but we have some visibility who's involved with that and who do we contact. The 990s are available. So it's more like transparency issue in addition under other requirements. So both, both options have this, this was the first bullet point which is really meant to have inclusive fundraising events. And this came out of the district staff of, you know, how would you do that? So that we don't have events that the ticket price excludes part of the school community. The second bullet is, falls into the category and this came from some of the parent feedback I've received where in some schools there's an expected per family or student fundraising target. If you have two students in school, we, you know, expect a donation or you to raise X amount which.

start time: 599:46:50.000
end time: 599:54:26.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Community.

start time: 599:55:38.000
end time: 604:21:20.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Members have abilities to raise different amounts of money or to donate it. So the ECS thing, if you have resources, just donate it. You don't have to go out and fundraise it. So putting different requirements, improvements on different families and to really have that not.

start time: 604:22:00.000
end time: 604:34:56.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Be part of the practice.

start time: 604:35:28.000
end time: 610:49:30.000
confidence: 0.85
A: In a public school system it's often something happens in private schools, but not schools. And then the third bullet included informed the broader school community about fundraising decision making processes. Again, that's a transparency issue within the school community. And the last bullet point is here to district policies administrative deficiency conference.

start time: 613:11:10.000
end time: 613:26:10.000
confidence: 1.00
B: And then.

start time: 614:04:30.000
end time: 642:00:32.000
confidence: 0.89
A: There'D be like annual review with budgeting. That board would get superintendent and other provisions. District foundation would have representative, broader school, large numbers. So that's a high level. Like here. Here's the two policies. They have some things in options. And I say obviously the third option is do nothing or we can look at some other variation. But these seem to be the ones that oh let's say more donors and creating members have most directionally aligned with what I was hearing. And in all practical terms that means for next school year. The current. Because, because the practice now is that you have to identify and pay through by June 30 that this cycle would allow that when it's actually actively being raised. But then after June 30th the that would be at least an option to. That would be not allowed anymore. So for which would really be for the 25, 26. So school communities within the school year. I mean them, if they had foundations with their fundraising, they would have said what staff they're going to purchase and.

start time: 642:00:56.000
end time: 642:10:20.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Then.

start time: 642:54:00.000
end time: 648:41:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Have paid that by June 30 and then so that would next year and starting July 1, starting 2025, 25, 26, it would be like you're not heading into the school year knowing that you're going to be having a fundraiser for staff. It doesn't mean we can't raise money.

start time: 648:42:20.000
end time: 651:13:20.000
confidence: 0.82
C: For the things clarify. So all the other money raised from now would apply towards ft for the 2020.

start time: 651:35:40.000
end time: 661:02:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Right, right. Which how it used to be is like literally they could raise money during the school year to pay for staff that they already had. And one of the things that changed and was if you had they then had a deadline that they actually had to pay for before they encumbered. Does that make sense? Yeah. Go ahead Director Sullivan.

start time: 661:15:50.000
end time: 670:09:10.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yes. One thing I think is really important is who decides how to distribute the funds if it's a whole group. And I'm really interested. You're saying that other districts have a way of doing this and I'd be interested in seeing how that works for them, how they decide how to distribute it. And I think that would be very important in getting people to be more interested in a whole, you know, district wide fundraising.

start time: 670:21:30.000
end time: 672:00:02.000
confidence: 0.89
A: That's a, that's a great question, Director Sullivan. So we'll get that kind of the.

start time: 672:00:26.000
end time: 672:26:30.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Mechanics of how it works.

start time: 672:32:10.000
end time: 678:58:00.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Well, I just did some quick math about. So based on this, these other school districts. So if PPS raised the same amount for students as Tiger 12, we could raise. I mean it'd be $10 million which would not be.

start time: 679:09:40.000
end time: 679:56:12.000
confidence: 0.85
B: But. And their median income household is also.

start time: 679:57:56.000
end time: 680:36:28.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Lower than in Portland. Yeah.

start time: 680:38:04.000
end time: 681:19:20.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So relative to what the median is.

start time: 681:25:40.000
end time: 681:46:20.000
confidence: 0.72
A: I just drove that by.

start time: 681:47:00.000
end time: 683:22:04.000
confidence: 0.98
B: There could be a multiplier to add. You know, for the additional median income we could raise even more.

start time: 683:23:32.000
end time: 703:16:20.000
confidence: 0.92
A: More than half percent. Yeah. So that's a. That's a great question. We'll try and get an answer and we'll try and get in advance so that you have that it also one of the things just that I was thinking about Rex Sullivan and the. So let's see. There is somewhere where the. The formulas decided by the foundation. You could have the distribution formula just be approved by. If you could look at option one, the first bullet at the kind of at the bottom of the page you'll see it says the formula is annually viewed by the district's foundation board of directors. We could change that to the school board or you could have a school board setting it. So just know that that would that.

start time: 703:17:00.000
end time: 705:16:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Change then when the board changes over or how does that stay encoded in perpetuity?

start time: 706:14:20.000
end time: 707:11:16.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So I hate to say it this is but like nothing is in perpetuity.

start time: 707:13:08.000
end time: 707:24:00.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Right.

start time: 707:36:50.000
end time: 708:49:14.000
confidence: 0.82
A: Because you know, boards can't encumber future boards. True.

start time: 708:50:02.000
end time: 709:21:50.000
confidence: 0.89
B: And that's what I was asking.

start time: 709:47:30.000
end time: 712:05:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I would say one of the things that we need to do is needs to be like front loaded at the beginning of the year so everybody knows what it would look like.

start time: 713:12:50.000
end time: 725:19:20.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Because one of the things I see that you said in some of the options, number 10 was require the district to create a broader base equity funding formula. And so now I know we have an equity formula. And how would that fit in with the people who at this point are not getting the advantage of the equity formula but are raising quite a bit of money. So somehow we have to make that clear to how that's going to work. And it's going to be hard especially if you can change it every year. So I think that's a very important part of the policy.

start time: 725:31:00.000
end time: 734:03:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, I think it's a great question. And I will say number 10, like I say this option was like here are all the different things we can do. My assumption is if you. That probably would be more in play if you did option one, which is. It's just more complicated.

start time: 734:13:00.000
end time: 739:37:20.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Yeah, it's just. I mean for me I would Just like to see what, what the other districts, how they are figuring that out for the distribution and how we could make it part of the. Whatever option we're voting on. At this point, I don't feel comfortable with either option, so I just think it has to be clear.

start time: 739:52:40.000
end time: 740:08:00.000
confidence: 0.78
A: Okay.

start time: 740:10:40.000
end time: 742:06:56.000
confidence: 0.99
D: And I personally need to know more, so that's up to me. And I'll look to you to help me get the information.

start time: 742:09:28.000
end time: 744:10:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Okay, yeah, we can do that. It's a great question. I'm sure a lot of other people have as well.

start time: 744:39:20.000
end time: 746:21:36.000
confidence: 0.90
B: True. I was curious about this other document that was posted, the funding of schooling staff.

start time: 746:22:48.000
end time: 746:34:56.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Oh, yeah, that was.

start time: 746:36:08.000
end time: 754:53:34.000
confidence: 0.94
B: And that has like an option. It's got a menu of options that together. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate the work on that. So what I'd like to understand, I guess, is I'd like to kind of see it model through with the numbers to see how, you know, I'm leaning towards option two, but to see how option two actually works out. You know, I mean, does it. Does it get it closer to, you know, making sure that all school students.

start time: 754:55:12.000
end time: 755:13:50.000
confidence: 0.73
A: All the public work.

start time: 755:46:50.000
end time: 759:35:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Have equitable access, which I think option two does, but I don't know that. Have we tested all these different menu options to run it through so we know what the. What the output is?

start time: 760:02:50.000
end time: 760:11:30.000
confidence: 0.70
A: Well, we.

start time: 760:12:10.000
end time: 760:39:14.000
confidence: 0.78
D: Yeah, number nine on that same policy.

start time: 760:40:42.000
end time: 766:28:28.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Is good too, to test our. We would want to test our assumptions. And Beth, I think you might have provided us with a model at one point of what the current system produces versus what another, a different system would produce, which I don't know where it is.

start time: 766:29:24.000
end time: 767:46:00.000
confidence: 0.68
A: Somewhere we can Google we have some box information.

start time: 767:56:20.000
end time: 768:36:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yeah, I'd like to see it modeled out.

start time: 769:51:10.000
end time: 774:08:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So I will say, like, we can't model all these ones out because they just. Some of them are just different. So, for example, state number nine in policy, direct the district, create a transparent pool of FTE that schools with class sizes over a certain size can tap for additional support.

start time: 774:19:10.000
end time: 774:54:30.000
confidence: 0.82
B: Yeah, that would be difficult.

start time: 774:57:10.000
end time: 777:19:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Well, we proposed that and as you may recall, as part of bargaining, I think we had a million dollars.

start time: 778:38:10.000
end time: 779:11:10.000
confidence: 0.85
B: No, he asked me these questions.

start time: 779:19:30.000
end time: 788:38:10.000
confidence: 0.91
A: I think it was about a million dollars that we put a fund and we were having all the discussions about class sizes and supports. So we like, for example, we model it out. It's not, it's not going to be a distribution of money. It's like, here's what it might look like. But we did offer that, for example, in vat, make a decision to go a different direction. But we had a pool of Money. And then if you came up to thresholds, you could potentially get an EA or half an ea.

start time: 788:59:50.000
end time: 792:19:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And I think that's also. I guess my overarching question is, which of these scenarios gets us closer to the outcome?

start time: 792:42:40.000
end time: 812:57:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I mean, frankly, I will say, I think gets to Patty's issue as well, is option number two and then doing the distribution on a per student basis. Because if you think about the district already saying, we have an equity formula, so our formula is equitable. And so if you just add in certain places, then it takes an equitable format formula, and it's a sort of. Because it's random how it somewhat. How it impacts. So doing things on a per student basis would essentially take the equity formula and on a per student basis just move everything. Does that make sense? But that's. If you did that, if you just use it a per student.

start time: 814:00:50.000
end time: 814:46:02.000
confidence: 0.88
D: Then everybody'd rise up together.

start time: 814:47:46.000
end time: 822:17:34.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So you just take the whole formula and it'll just be okay. Say we have a pot of. Say we do. You know, we can competitively compete with Tiger twelton. We get 262. We had $10 million. Is like, how do you. On a per student basis? What is. What does that mean? And then you take a school, you have X number of students, and this is how much you get.

start time: 822:20:22.000
end time: 824:07:10.000
confidence: 0.85
C: Well, like on a pessimistic side, say we keep our total pursuit rate 62.

start time: 824:07:50.000
end time: 824:11:10.000

C: Yeah, but then we get into. I mean, that's when we go for student. I mean that. I think your point of saying, like, we already have an equity format, so we add everything. The idea is that we're moving everything up geometrically.

end time: 862:24:18.000
confidence: 0.91
A: One of the things, because of our base funding is that if you're a smaller school, you already in some ways get more staff per student because you don't have the economies of scale. I mean, obviously, in the ideal world, we would have $8 million in Esther dollars like we did this year, every year. Because to me that is the big challenge of option number one. So maybe we stop. I think option number two is pretty clear cut. And Patti asks, I think the most sort of salient question about how it's.

start time: 862:24:34.000
end time: 862:47:10.000

C: Patty's hands raised again.

A: Your hand is raised again, Patti.

start time: 863:36:10.000
end time: 869:31:34.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Oh. Just to say I don't think we can work this out right now, but can we have a time to look at other people's programs and see what they did so we can have an option that feels more secure? Because I don't want to do an option that we can just every year make a different decision about how it happens.

start time: 869:33:42.000
end time: 878:02:00.000
confidence: 0.92
A: We're not moving anything out of committee today. So yes, we're going to take a question, get more information so we can see how other people's do. They say I spent the last 17 years in Washington county and most of those school districts, including Beaverton and Hillsboro all have one central foundation and then divide them on the up. They do it different ways, but they, it all goes in centrally to rate.

start time: 878:13:40.000
end time: 882:31:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: But I just like to know the different ways it's done and what works and, and then because, you know, we're, we're unique too. So. But I think it needs to be presented in a way that's clear, clearer than now.

start time: 882:40:50.000
end time: 905:32:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yep. So option number one, I would say I'm just going to kind of walk through paragraphs and some. Because there's some places where you can, you can make more changes because there's. It's just a different model. And again, this is more based on something similar that we did this last year and it required the district have resources put into the cause. Essentially it's saying right now we have this equity formula and there's a little bit of movement for the schools that are of highest need because they get the equity grants, but they're quite a bit lower, not that much. And then at the other end you get a bigger. I'm sorry, they're down here. These guys move up a little bit. The schools with the highest incomes that raise the most money, they go up a bunch and then the people in the middle don't move at all. And what happened this year is it wasn't that everybody moved up the same amount because schools could still fundraise, but essentially everybody moved up to 100, 100,000 plus $11 per student was the formula.

start time: 905:33:50.000
end time: 906:43:42.000
confidence: 0.90
B: That was for every school. Yes. So this is that 100,000 per school.

start time: 906:45:26.000
end time: 907:34:10.000
confidence: 0.81
A: That the principals could determine.

start time: 907:45:10.000
end time: 909:24:36.000
confidence: 0.97
D: But we know we can't count on that this year. So it's not a viable option.

start time: 909:26:28.000
end time: 910:44:40.000
confidence: 0.91
B: So that was not based on me, that was just police were distributed.

start time: 910:51:40.000
end time: 914:23:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Right. So why this is complicated is like I didn't say for like that if you're a school that has a foundation, you would get $100,000 plus $11.

start time: 914:37:00.000
end time: 914:44:36.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Right.

start time: 914:45:48.000
end time: 931:01:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: And you know, and then you have the questions like if people know they would get, for example, we're going to get 100,000 and that could be 80,000, it could be 30,000. I mean that's, that's a number that could change. But if schools knew that they were going to get that if they didn't raise any money to pay for staff, would they still raise money to pay for staff? And so the question would be, you say you raise this amount, you give one third to the pot and maybe you can raise a little bit more than 100,000. Save that. So like as an incentive like to raise the money versus just take the districts. It's way more, it's more complicated. But like I say, I think last year was the first year that I heard the fewest number amount of complaints from schools of like hey, we didn't, we didn't have an opportunity to.

start time: 931:34:30.000
end time: 931:40:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Really.

start time: 931:41:10.000
end time: 946:27:50.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Large kindergarten class and we didn't have an opportunity to get an EA or we needed the PE teacher for another point three and didn't have a pe. So this year there was a lot less than that in 11 years on the board. So that's why I say 11, that's why I was trying to come up with an option. But it's more complicated. I'm going to walk through some of the just different points because I want people to think about it because I say it somewhat like what we did this last year. So in the new paragraph two, the second line, we need to add the words and like that be clear that the fund school would be the centralized place for district level fundraising for staff.

start time: 946:33:20.000
end time: 947:57:28.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Just to be clear, instead of saying just serving as a fiscal agent.

start time: 947:59:04.000
end time: 948:56:56.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Right, because it's making it saying you're just serving for fiscal agent. For those schools that have a foundation.

start time: 948:57:28.000
end time: 949:24:24.000
confidence: 0.94
B: They will be the decision maker.

start time: 949:26:32.000
end time: 962:08:30.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Yeah, well it's just, it's making clear that you could still have money coming in centrally that then gets distributed. However we decide to get distributed, that can be used for staff. It's not like it's not like fission of the fundraiser, it's just unsaid. So walking through here, the places where there is you could change things, go down to equitable fundraising for staff. And contract for staff number two, the $100,011 per student. I just dropped that in because that's what we did last year. And I don't know what the thinking was about how we came up with that.

start time: 969:22:10.000
end time: 970:05:46.000
confidence: 0.84
B: I feel like I fail you in these conversations every immediately.

start time: 970:06:18.000
end time: 970:26:02.000
confidence: 0.84
A: I don't, I don't have.

start time: 970:27:46.000
end time: 970:49:30.000
confidence: 0.89
B: I don't know what happens in regards.

start time: 970:50:50.000
end time: 985:30:46.000
confidence: 0.92
A: That's great. So. But you did give me the information. It was $100,011 per student. So you just say if you have a student, a student body of 1800, it's one thing. If it's 200. So again those numbers would change. You can say, hey, we're going to shoot 50,000. And that I had for that would be for schools that do not fund staff positions. And then when you get down into the next. You get into the next bullet points. We have the first 10,000 raised stays in school. That's current practice. The 30%. It actually I was just using the current one, but it's actually 33%. Okay, that, that's a typo.

start time: 985:32:38.000
end time: 986:03:34.000
confidence: 0.75
B: Okay, I just wondered about that.

start time: 986:06:22.000
end time: 999:25:32.000
confidence: 0.94
A: But you could, you could have it be any number. You could say okay, if they're going to. Everybody else is getting a certain amount. If they're going to raise their own money, we're going to say they only to put 20, you know, 20% in that. You could change that or you could say yeah, or you could say you can raise, you know, 200,000, but you're going to put 40% in any. So that's a. I meant to use the current number but I want you to know that that is a point where you could change it. And then later on in that paragraph when you. This is the issue of that Patti raised about and sorry and Eddie, who decides what the formula is. I do think it should be set.

start time: 999:25:56.000
end time: 999:42:20.000
confidence: 0.91
B: At the beginning of the year.

start time: 999:43:00.000
end time: 1024:14:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: You could have a two year biennium set so everybody knows what it is. And then in the second bullet point, when I'm at the. The B, this would be something new that you couldn't raise more than 130,000 for school. So right now you can raise unlimited amounts. You have to give 33% but you can raise unlimited amounts after we look at the data. But 130 is covers a lot of the schools, not all of them, but a lot of them. And again, I think this would be something you need to look at because my guess is you said the only reason 30. And if it goes to the centralized foundation that people would say, oh, just let's not raise any unit this year and we'll just take the districts but again it's got some sort of cap on it because otherwise then you just are in the never ending. There'll always be schools that are raising a lot and trying to keep the equity formula all rising together.

start time: 1024:59:00.000
end time: 1026:39:18.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I'm curious how we went put a cap on what schools could raise.

start time: 1026:42:14.000
end time: 1043:29:34.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Well they just couldn't spend more than 130,000 because they have to pay the district for the staff. So you could say okay you want to purchase 44,000. We don't have any principals here. I can ears for example so you could under this say okay you could potentially have three EAs under this. But again that number 2000 off. Sorry. Yeah but I think what we saw in a lot of the there are there's a lot of smoothing out like oh we wanted to make sure that our library specialist was full time not 175 anyway.

start time: 1043:30:22.000
end time: 1045:09:30.000
confidence: 0.98
B: In other words that money would go further because it was just to cover gaps between.

start time: 1045:25:10.000
end time: 1059:13:56.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Yeah I mean it just depends if you look at in the past what schools have spent a bomb but again that number couldn't. You could set it in different places. On the other requirements on the next page this would be for both options. It says fundraising group that raised staffing funds shall and I actually think you should just eliminate the word staffing funds because I would think that we would want these no matter what type of fundraising you're doing. This paragraph is other requirements just remove.

start time: 1059:14:28.000
end time: 1059:35:20.000
confidence: 0.99
B: The word staffing.

start time: 1061:35:50.000
end time: 1062:46:50.000
confidence: 0.88
A: And then I move down another places where.

start time: 1063:50:30.000
end time: 1068:21:08.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And then for this it shall provide 10% of the total anticipated admission tickets. Would you not want to tie that percentage to the number of free reduced or some other metric that kind of aligns with the poverty rate.

start time: 1068:24:14.000
end time: 1070:25:40.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Well it says or whatever percentage this policy for families who want to attend. But for.

start time: 1071:44:00.000
end time: 1074:19:40.000
confidence: 0.85
B: That'S assuming that there's only 10% of a given school I can't afford. I was one of those parents that couldn't afford fundraisers even if I fundraised.

start time: 1075:02:40.000
end time: 1121:14:16.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Okay just a second language to better I think that the parentheses is what we're trying to need to meet the promise. So if you have better language that's not a statement and then parentheses yeah we do it again this is this trying to use the first draft the second to last bullet which says submit funds made for staff no later than there is a current timeline. Again it's not policy so that would be added and then the last bullet point just to let people know the designate and pay actual cost wage and benefits for the staff covered. So in the past what's happened is some schools have paid use their funds to pay for the least expensive staff person versus the one that they were actually getting. So this. This was a reform that many of these things are things that fund PPS instituted. So this is just a carryover and we decided that and then the moving down to the policy the second to last paragraph. I'm sorry the third to last the staffing funds must be translated just required staffing to members. That seems like that should move up to the other requirements section. And then I feel like the district foundation shallow board of directorships and the broader school community large number needs more work and we need to would need to know what have the relationship and it's a statement I'm looking for you like we we do have an agreement between a district and so and so it would need to. Whatever we do here needs to be in sync with that.

start time: 1121:15:28.000
end time: 1121:26:20.000

start time: 1122:53:12.000
end time: 1126:31:40.000
confidence: 0.90
B: And there's the. There are also the bylaws and the other agreement. The fund is an existing entity with its own formation documents. So all of those need to be in alignment.

start time: 1127:05:30.000
end time: 1143:06:50.000
confidence: 0.90
A: I mean historically when it came to so I used to be just full disclosure on the corner schools foundation board which then became all hands and I was there from the schools foundation to all hands. They decided not to basically get involved in district level issues but they still do the fundraising for it board and and manage these local school foundations. Then when I came here we carried because they were were done managing your all these small local school foundations. I came here then we had agreement created created fund in 2018 and it has a whole bunch of documents.

end time: 1149:14:36.000
confidence: 0.89
A: So I mean for efficiency like it seems like it would be easiest to use. Yes. As the vehicle but I'm just. Because I'm trying to recognize this like and it's not just like one sentence here. We make that happen.

start time: 1149:15:48.000
end time: 1152:01:16.000

start time: 1166:52:29.000
end time: 1175:54:56.000
confidence: 0.92
A: But the. The concept as a fund for PBS was to be like the vessel for all fundraising. So I, I don't think intention of like it's to be an avenue in which we can raise money to support our students. It fits under that umbrella. So I don't think it's antagonistic, but I'm just trying to recognize like, we can't just say something in policy and then it happens. Mary.

start time: 1182:02:00.000
end time: 1184:43:44.000
confidence: 0.92

start time: 1184:45:12.000
end time: 1186:56:02.000
confidence: 0.89

start time: 1186:56:26.000
end time: 1192:58:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Tickets or fundraising groups that raise staffing funds shall include in all school programs. So as a way of being inclusive rather than limiting it to 10%. And 10% might be the good number. But if it's a school that has, you know, 78% pre. Reduced, that might not include all of the number of families.

end time: 1205:53:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: My kids went to a school where I could not afford to fundraisers. So, you know, this is a way of not stopping. Limiting the number of tickets to 10% or at least 10%, but actually saying if you have a higher poverty rate in your school, then that number needs to move up and be indexed to that poverty rate.

start time: 1206:39:20.000
end time: 1209:59:00.000
confidence: 0.90

end time: 1233:13:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yeah, to me. So like right now we do have. We do have a foundation policy and a. I forget what this one used to be called, but it was something like parent fundraising. So I just picked one and put them together more for like efficiency. So people are looking at what are the rules around it and so you have more one place to go versus looking different places. But I, I mean maybe to get to your point and also your part, Michelle, is liking what you want policy to be high enough level that every time inflation changes or school community changes that you haven't. You're not like you got to change it from 20% to 18 every night. So you should try and keep it.

start time: 1233:25:20.000
end time: 1233:51:40.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Maybe a little vague. Yes.

start time: 1233:58:40.000
end time: 1239:18:16.000
confidence: 0.89
C: I'm just thinking like you know, in my dream world, right. We have a district and let's say some billionaires want to go on rent a yacht and throw a big party where it's like $2 million entry ticket and they're going to raise us $50 million. You know, I'm not going to say no to that because that policy, you know.

start time: 1239:20:48.000
end time: 1239:37:00.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Yeah. Yeah.

start time: 1239:44:00.000
end time: 1239:59:52.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Like what if.

start time: 1240:01:36.000
end time: 1246:53:50.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Okay, so here's what I would do if that happens. I would like draft a resolution to waive the policy. Exceptional. Exceptional circumstances. Okay. I like your dream. Yeah, I do too. I mean you obviously don't want, you want your policy to be flexible enough. Like 95% of the time it works. So you, you're not waving it.

start time: 1247:29:30.000
end time: 1248:44:30.000
confidence: 0.92
C: No, I, I agree with the, the, the spirit of it.

start time: 1249:57:30.000
end time: 1253:41:30.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Well, so maybe it's. So the policy, I mean in the perfect world would be kind of the what this is the how in the administrative directive. Like the how. How you do it. How do you make.

start time: 1254:14:30.000
end time: 1257:17:34.000
confidence: 0.84
A: You don't have administrative directives for policies, do we? I mean one of the things.

start time: 1257:19:02.000
end time: 1260:12:40.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I was just went to your point. It seems like there's a lot in here. It's somewhat prescriptive in some spaces in some parts. And I think a good policy is.

start time: 1260:21:40.000
end time: 1261:25:00.000
confidence: 0.87
A: High level, big but not too big.

start time: 1261:27:00.000
end time: 1261:48:40.000
confidence: 0.96
B: But not too big.

start time: 1265:59:30.000
end time: 1273:33:20.000
confidence: 0.88
A: I think it makes more sense especially policymakers online to try and keep like concepts together. So it could be things that are specific. Then get in more spelled out in the ad versus policy and change it.

start time: 1273:50:20.000
end time: 1273:56:36.000
confidence: 0.98
F: Yeah.

start time: 1273:57:08.000
end time: 1278:34:00.000
confidence: 0.93
B: If stuff is going to be massaged over time that where policy direction has been given. That's very helpful in ad because policy adoption process can. Clarifying changes updates to practice.

start time: 1279:36:20.000
end time: 1284:36:40.000
confidence: 0.84
A: Okay. I'm looking at the time. What I'm going to ask is if you, if I just include you is if you have questions or ideas or to send them to me. Don't do file. We can't do.

start time: 1284:48:20.000

B: The next meeting.

start time: 1288:02:08.000
end time: 1288:28:40.000

A: Maybe we can discuss it further.

start time: 1288:30:40.000
end time: 1290:01:40.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Maybe Patty and I Could I know someone on Tiger Tualet that we could talk to?

start time: 1290:48:00.000
end time: 1291:44:20.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Because this is a much nice thing. I'm sure that we can find there.

start time: 1291:53:20.000
end time: 1292:55:40.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Probably. I just. I liked Julia's personal interviews.

start time: 1293:01:20.000
end time: 1305:28:22.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah, I know some people have told. Or I think it was Julia told me that, you know, Tagatan and Lake Oswego and different other districts have policies that include, you know, larger money making situations. So I just like to see what. What they are because I've also heard that in some ways ours has been a model because there are some places that just. They keep all their money. They don't give any of it back to a central amount. So. Yeah. I will extend my ideas to you, Julia, and I appreciate any information anybody has. I'd really like to take a look at it.

start time: 1305:30:06.000
end time: 1307:25:58.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Great. We'll post it so people can. Everybody can see it. And it's very transparent.

start time: 1307:28:54.000
end time: 1307:48:50.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Okay, great.

start time: 1307:55:10.000
end time: 1311:39:30.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Switch to the next agenda item. And whose point is. Would I. Life is just a very high level. Some of the. Some of these changes are statutory. It's my understanding.

start time: 1311:40:50.000
end time: 1311:45:54.000
confidence: 0.80
B: Yes.

start time: 1311:46:42.000
end time: 1315:34:42.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And I think the statutory changes, if you can just briefly call it out, like this is a statutory change and then the places that aren't, if we could call those out because obviously things.

start time: 1315:35:06.000
end time: 1316:48:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: That are statutory changes, these are all statutory changes, actually.

start time: 1316:57:30.000
end time: 1317:18:26.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Really 100%.

start time: 1317:19:38.000
end time: 1327:38:36.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Okay, hold on. I'm pretty sure. So I was hoping Yang would be here. Yeah, we thought of the pancake breakfast. So what you see in terms of the requirement for additional half credits, those are legislative changes. Those are new requirements. We have removed the essential skills. That has been put on hold until 2027.

start time: 1327:41:08.000
end time: 1332:12:44.000
confidence: 0.96
A: You know, Mary, can we just walk through by page? Okay. Yeah. 1A. So those, the social studies and science changes, those and also the ones on the next page, those are all like personal finance.

start time: 1332:13:32.000
end time: 1337:55:48.000
confidence: 0.88
B: Those are personal finance. And the higher education career path skills are new and they are beginning the class of 2027. So those are credit speech. We don't know a whole lot about it. ODE is still propagating, developing the regs around this, but we wanted to get this in place.

start time: 1337:58:04.000
end time: 1338:20:40.000
confidence: 0.99
A: But it's statutory.

start time: 1338:38:20.000
end time: 1338:56:36.000
confidence: 0.99
B: It's a requirement.

start time: 1338:58:28.000
end time: 1339:12:52.000
confidence: 0.64
A: So then.

start time: 1339:15:56.000
end time: 1347:11:16.000
confidence: 0.90
B: And then we chat. We have chat. And I wish. Boy, I would feel you could speak to this piece of it. Some of the credit requirements for, you know, the. In terms of education and career related learning experiences, those are modified slightly. Those are great. And then students develop their own portfolio.

start time: 1347:13:18.000
end time: 1348:05:44.000
confidence: 0.83
A: Sort of like you're saying that is statutory or.

start time: 1348:08:32.000
end time: 1349:35:40.000
confidence: 0.85
B: I don't recall if that is statutory when it's Statutory? Is it. Could it be regulatory?

start time: 1349:44:00.000
end time: 1350:16:20.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Is it required? Is my.

start time: 1350:33:20.000
end time: 1356:39:40.000
confidence: 0.90
B: I'm not, I'm not sure about this. The language around this or this is called hours. The portfolio. A portfolio is required, but I don't know the specifics of it. So I don't know if we have created this portfolio plan, but that's. We've made some changes to it.

start time: 1356:54:00.000
end time: 1360:29:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So Mary, whether it's this committee or ING's committee, it seems like it would be useful on all of these to know like this is required because we're not going to spend a lot of time talking about it.

start time: 1360:30:00.000
end time: 1360:38:08.000
confidence: 0.67
B: Yeah.

start time: 1360:39:44.000
end time: 1371:17:06.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Versus other things. Like I'm really interested in work that for example, the essential skills. And then also there's this section. I meant this. So is it the essential skills? It got delayed several times. But is it actually gone?

start time: 1371:18:58.000
end time: 1375:54:42.000
confidence: 0.93
B: It's not gone gone, but it's it. But it's been put on hold until I want to say 2027 or 2029. And given the many changes, my perception was this, this policy will be back in front of you in, you know, suspended until 2728.

start time: 1375:56:26.000
end time: 1377:55:20.000
confidence: 0.83
A: Yeah. So some of my preference would be I'll just sit here.

start time: 1379:08:20.000
end time: 1380:16:40.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Someone will be here to look at the diploma policy is our hope.

start time: 1380:37:40.000
end time: 1393:30:44.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So this I guess maybe is more than working your committee. My preference would be not. Would just be to put in parentheses like this section suspended until, you know, by the state currently, something like that. So it's not to remove it because one of the. One of the topics that board members who aren't here but who would like to conversation like to have is like, do we have any sort of base level besides just earning credits, which you can do and get Ds. Do we have some sort of standard which I think people are like, okay, the minimal standard we have is essential skills. And now if we're taking it out, like, what is our minimal standard?

start time: 1393:31:32.000
end time: 1394:04:00.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Whether we do it in terms of whether.

start time: 1394:17:00.000
end time: 1394:54:00.000
confidence: 0.99
A: You don't have to answer that. Thank God.

start time: 1395:27:40.000
end time: 1396:12:04.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I think a lot of us are curious about this question.

start time: 1396:13:32.000
end time: 1400:28:40.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Right. Which I think maybe is a way better question to have in your committee. But I'll just say, like I would be hesitant to remove this when it's actually not been deleted from.

start time: 1400:45:40.000
end time: 1401:30:04.000
confidence: 0.92
B: It's just been held in advance. Right. For the.

start time: 1401:32:52.000
end time: 1402:14:40.000
confidence: 0.89
A: I knew there was some legal term that would advance.

start time: 1402:35:00.000
end time: 1405:16:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: There we go. I see. That I can do. Yeah. Which means it's on hold until. On hold. There's no requirement for the next few years.

start time: 1405:18:20.000
end time: 1409:04:42.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Okay. So maybe we can get you skip the language that they're using right now. They're telling the districts about what they're saying about it. Like, just put this on hold until whenever, just so Director Long's committee knows it.

start time: 1409:06:26.000
end time: 1409:17:50.000
confidence: 0.67
B: Yeah.

start time: 1409:34:10.000
end time: 1410:16:30.000
confidence: 0.80
E: There's a really nice summary, Mary.

start time: 1410:42:10.000
end time: 1415:14:40.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Yeah. Personalized learning requirements for diploma education, clinical trials. Again, Yang can talk about. And that's what we have a. It's been modified. So you see that. That portfolio.

start time: 1415:32:20.000
end time: 1425:32:16.000
confidence: 0.97
A: But if. If we take out the essential skills, just like, hey. And then, you know, five years from now, when they get back to it, the board can add it back. It will, I believe, open up a huge conversation about what are our standards? I mean, I think we're gonna have that conversation anyway, but it will be taking out, I think, what people believe were the most minimal level of standards other than the credit hours. Okay, I'm sorry, are we taking out the administrative directive because we don't need one or we don't need to say that? Is that why we're taking that?

start time: 1425:33:28.000
end time: 1428:18:20.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Because we already have one. We actually have like four. So that's administrative directives related to this policy. So it's just a. It's done.

start time: 1429:16:40.000
end time: 1436:14:34.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Oh, here's. Here's the one I was looking at. NVA. So currently in 2004 or 5pps, for example, created a. The world language credits. I don't think it's.

start time: 1436:15:22.000
end time: 1436:22:50.000
confidence: 0.71
B: That's.

start time: 1436:24:10.000
end time: 1437:55:06.000
confidence: 0.87
A: That's not a state requirement. I don't believe that's a PPS requirement.

start time: 1437:56:58.000
end time: 1438:04:42.000
confidence: 0.92
G: We.

start time: 1438:06:26.000
end time: 1438:49:10.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Yeah, the.

start time: 1438:55:30.000
end time: 1440:41:14.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I recall this because we worked on it the last time we opened this policy, there was a requirement that could combine.

start time: 1440:42:02.000
end time: 1441:52:44.000
confidence: 0.74
A: So you ct.

start time: 1441:54:42.000
end time: 1443:31:00.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Right. And be in the district one and two.

start time: 1443:36:00.000
end time: 1446:11:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Well, that's the career and technical education, the arts. Or a third credit world language. But you still have to have two world languages. Two years of school.

start time: 1446:12:00.000
end time: 1446:40:08.000
confidence: 0.88
B: That's our personal right.

start time: 1446:41:04.000
end time: 1455:49:20.000
confidence: 0.90
A: That's our. So, for example, my question. I'm singing here. This is maybe a question for the next meeting or for your meeting is I don't know that I've ever seen a report from the superintendent on the number of nature of waivers granted from the school year. Pardon? Is that it? That's the only one that you guys vote on?

start time: 1455:50:00.000
end time: 1456:03:00.000
confidence: 0.78
B: And there's.

start time: 1456:32:50.000
end time: 1466:31:40.000
confidence: 0.91
A: My question is, do we have students, for example, who say I actually speak or like French? French is my. Not. My English isn't my first language. I already speak this other language. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna get two credits in language. I'm gonna. So I'm going to get 22 credits, which meets the state requirements, but doesn't meet the PPS requirements. Has the superintendent been granting exceptions to the. I think those are the. I think the whole language is the only one we have in excess of the state.

start time: 1467:12:40.000
end time: 1468:39:00.000
confidence: 0.90
B: I don't know the. I thought. I thought that if you didn't learn language, it had to be different from the one that you speak.

start time: 1469:12:40.000
end time: 1482:31:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So here are the questions I'm going to give to your committee. What requirements do we have that are beyond the state requirements? Because my understanding is that there is 25. I saw this 22. And then the world language was ours that was above and beyond state requirement. And then in 5A, the question is, has the superintendent been granting exceptions to the diploma requirements in excess of the state diploma requirements? And if so, what does that look like? I mean, it may not be an issue at all and he may not have been doing it.

start time: 1484:18:50.000
end time: 1484:35:50.000
confidence: 0.58
E: Ignorant.

start time: 1485:21:30.000
end time: 1485:37:06.000

B: I used to.

start time: 1485:38:18.000
end time: 1485:42:10.000

A: Now.

start time: 1485:42:50.000
end time: 1485:52:30.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Now.

start time: 1488:34:50.000
end time: 1489:33:22.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Is that the only change?

start time: 1489:36:26.000
end time: 1490:32:30.000
confidence: 0.89
B: I think we really need the academic folks here.

start time: 1490:40:10.000
end time: 1492:13:50.000
confidence: 0.85
A: What I'm looking at the changes isn't looking if there's any other red line.

start time: 1492:21:30.000
end time: 1494:16:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: But the questions you want answered. We have people who know them like that. They do.

start time: 1494:40:20.000
end time: 1499:28:00.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Okay. Well, the good news is because they're not here, we might actually not have. But I think I've outlined a set of questions that I had about this from a policy standpoint, not necessarily from an academic standpoint.

start time: 1499:37:40.000
end time: 1501:00:44.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So what I heard is you'd like us to modify the essential skills to keep it in, but just put a kind of a caveat.

start time: 1501:01:32.000
end time: 1512:40:10.000
confidence: 0.88
A: So perhaps instead of a footnote. Exactly. I know Chair Hollins has some thoughts about this country schools. And then we can get rid of the administrative directive. That's not a big deal. And then whether the credit requirements, this whole personal education plan, whether that mirrors the state. And then my other. Only other question is around 5a. Did you all have other questions that are not curriculum committee, but just around calls?

start time: 1513:47:10.000
end time: 1518:04:00.000
confidence: 0.86
C: I mean. I mean my big question is just because these policy changes back to what we're doing. I mean besides the. Yeah. I mean there's some. Some states.

start time: 1520:13:00.000
end time: 1520:20:52.000

A: Yeah.

start time: 1520:21:56.000
end time: 1520:55:20.000
confidence: 0.85
C: I'm curious actually about the world language.

start time: 1521:06:20.000
end time: 1521:46:12.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Another time. World language. Oh, thanks.

start time: 1521:47:16.000
end time: 1525:13:40.000
confidence: 0.96
A: It was a big issue at the state level because there were a lot of districts like on. And where are they going to go from Enterprise people just so that was.

start time: 1525:53:20.000
end time: 1527:42:48.000
confidence: 0.89
B: We should get our student opportunity to speak that French. No, as an adult.
