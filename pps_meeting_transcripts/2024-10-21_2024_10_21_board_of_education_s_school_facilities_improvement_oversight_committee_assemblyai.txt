A: I know I said 6 10. We're still waiting for the stream to be set up. So as soon as I get the green light, we're going to go on this committee meeting. Are we good? All right, great. All right, welcome everybody. I'm going to go ahead and I don't even have a gavel, but we're going to call the order the meeting of the School Facilities Improvement Oversight Committee, newly named this year. It's a little bit of a long name, but we'll get used to it. School Facilities Improvement Oversight Committee. And just for reference, so everyone knows the members of this subcommittee of the board are myself, Director Brim Edwards and Director Green, who I think was going to try and join us virtually. But Ken, just let us know if he, if he gets here on the screen. Thank you. And then the other board members welcome. And we're really glad you're here to listen to the conversation. We only have one agenda item tonight. It is a big agenda item, but we're going to want to talk about the general obligation bond and begin. I won't even say begin. We've been in the planning process around this for a very long time. But further that conversation and actually begin to wrap up, I hope and begin to narrow in on what are the remaining questions around what a potential 2025 geobond would look like. And so in service of that we had there is a staff memo and I think I'm going to turn it over to you, Dan. I don't have many more over other opening remarks. Again, there's been a lot of work on this for a long time. We had originally talked about maybe going out for this election coming up in a couple weeks. We delayed that. And now some of the key questions which are in this state staff memo are about timing and size and the overall cycle and all those other key questions as well as the most important things about what we're going to do in the bond. I will say we did add a couple of comment slots, two minutes at the end of the meeting. So I know we have two people signed up for comment. I think we have five people on the wait list. I am hoping we move pretty efficiently through this conversation today. And the quicker we go, the more people will be able to take in terms of overall testimony. So hopefully we can do that as well. And I do hope everyone had a chance to read the memo. This is not a quiz and not a test. If you didn't, it's totally okay. I get it. We're busy people. But you might want to pull it up. There's a lot of really good information in there and it walks through a lot of the detail. And that memo is publicly available on the PPS website for anyone who hasn't seen it. With that, Dan Young, Chief Operating Officer of pps, I will turn it over to you.

B: Thank you and good evening. So there are two materials. You have the staff memo as Director Scott referenced and also put together a quick PowerPoint presentation. I gave you all a hard copy. It looks like this. We'll walk through it up here as well. It's 95% a cut and paste from the staff memo. Just thought it'd be helpful to just grab some of the highlights so we can walk through. The memo is pretty dense. Not going to go into a lot of detail, but we'll happily answer questions and I'm going to try and go through pretty quickly. The goal I think overarching tonight is to stay relatively high level and look to land some of the big rocks, if you will, the big variables around bond planning. So as we go forward we can, we can land some of the big pieces so we can start really refining the more the detail as we go along. So the goal tonight is really exactly that is really landing some of those variables around the bond size, the bond duration, the bond planning. That will allow staff to refine a plan and then bring back more detail. Be able to answer more direct questions as we, as we continue through bond planning.

start time: 72:11:36.000
end time: 87:51:00.000
confidence: 0.98
A: And Dan, can I just add one more thing? Thank you. Along those lines, I think I would like to answer those questions and very specifically the memo is laid out I think really well in terms of running through sort of all those different planning things. And we do get at the very end around some of the specifics. And I know that's what a number of people I think are here to talk about tonight. And I started seeing some emails around it and I really appreciate that we're going to touch on those options tonight. But I think the bulk of the conversation around the specifics. I actually want to play plan in a future bond meeting, which is also something at the end of the meeting we'll come back to. I want to talk a little bit to the committee and others about a cadence of, you know, getting some, some of these meetings scheduled over the next couple of months so we can solve some of these questions. So again we'll be going through some of those key issues. There are three options laid out. We probably won't dive very deeply into the specifics because we need to figure out these Other high level questions first and then we'll dive into those at a future meeting, but we will touch on that today.

start time: 87:52:40.000
end time: 105:30:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So certainly if we don't land on the higher level ones, the options sort of become irrelevant. So, quick background. We've met six times in public meetings since January. It is a very dense topic. There is lots and lots of information in the previous meeting materials. Way too much to go over all tonight. But here are links to those materials. Some of the initial committee and board direction from those meetings included pursuing a larger bond, not a specific amount, but a larger bond, continuing to prioritize the high school modernizations, allocate significant funds to address existing facilities, proceed with planned technology improvements that we have underway, and retain the existing levy rate. So we started in January. Relatively small. These are all big numbers, but relatively. And over time, the total bond amount you see increased until where we ended up in June was a total amount of almost $3 billion. So this is sort of our jumping off point for tonight.

start time: 105:41:30.000
end time: 109:06:58.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And I'm going to keep peppering you with little comments, but I just want to be clear, it's where we ended up in terms of needs, sort of immediate needs for the district. Right. So. And then the question is how much of those we think we can fit into a bond as we move forward, Correct? Yeah.

start time: 109:07:14.000
end time: 141:29:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Very good. So that's sort of like where we want to start. And the first staff recommendation, we have four that we want to focus on tonight is a target bond amount between 1.5 and $1.8 billion. The memo's got more detail, but there's two components, primary I think components here about this total bond size. One is around community support. We do have information that generally there is strong support for PPs to go out for another tenure obligation bond in the near future. However, that support is dependent upon a number of variables including. Including what that total size is and what we've seen or what we've heard is that when that total number gets above 1.5 billion, that overall support starts to noticeably decline. The other significant component here is capacity constraints. And we can only do so much at a time. So these billion dollar bonds take many years to complete, we estimate. So over the last 70 or so years, we've averaged about $200 million in total capital expenditure. And that varies, varies on lots of things, the type of projects in particular. So if we look at a rate between $150,250,000,000 a year and you take into account the existing capital that we have, the projects that we already have planned, a $1.5 billion bond will take us roughly eight to 14 years based upon that formula to expend all those funds a $.8 billion bo 10 to 16 years. What's the upshot there is adding more to it doesn't necessarily mean projects get done sooner. It just elongates those bond as those projects get done further down the line. Lots of variables there, but because of those two components is why we recommend that the total bond planning amount be between 1.5 billion and 1.8 billion. And so we're looking for some feedback from the committee.

start time: 142:48:50.000
end time: 143:11:38.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Do you want to stop on each one of these?

start time: 143:12:34.000
end time: 143:47:10.000
confidence: 0.83
B: Sure, if that works.

start time: 144:04:50.000
end time: 144:49:14.000
confidence: 0.97
A: I wasn't sure if you were going to go through the whole presentation and come back to it, but no, I.

start time: 144:49:22.000
end time: 145:09:14.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Think I can go either way.

start time: 145:10:42.000
end time: 184:57:38.000
confidence: 0.97
A: No, I actually, I think this, I think this works really well. So again, sort of teeing up that first question about overall bond size and maybe some of the things I'll add. I mean, Dan, you, you touched on it in terms of. We have information, you know, we did some polling around this and, and what the polling showed, and I don't have the details in front of me, but what it showed was strong support from the community for a bond of this size that maintain the existing tax rate. And this is one of the things that we always have a hard time explaining, but it's a very important component to explain because we're paying off previous bonds as we go forward. That creates a little bit more capacity. The levy rate is $2.50 per thousand. And what we're talking about here is an option where we could borrow between 1.5 and $1.8 billion and not raise anyone's taxes, which is kind of incredible when you think about it. But I don't want to overstate that. It just means we're taking out another 20 to 30 years of debt to and to pay for some of these, some of these facilities. But polling showed that if we're able to maintain that existing tax rate and the tax rate would drop otherwise, to be really clear. But if we're able to maintain that existing tax rate, we can borrow this money. There was strong support for that. It did begin to drop the higher the number went even. And there are some ways we can structure a larger dollar amount that also maintains an existing tax rate, but it means taking out much, much larger, much, much longer term debt with a much higher interest payment. And so support started fading for that. And then when we also pulled an increase in the tax rate, it sank pretty quickly. And so that was also. And I will tell you, I mean I. This shouldn't be a surprise coming out of some of the things we talked about last year during the teacher strike and the incredible facility needs. I would love to be able to make the case to the public for a tax increase. And I think that what the way we do that is by continuing to lay the groundwork through the bond programs that we are using, continuing, I think to let you know, the economy recover post Covid, continuing to build support and trust and there is a possibility in the future that our community would support itself another tax increase for our buildings, for our kids. That's not the case today. And that was compelling to me because I wanted to sort of say let's look at a tax increase. And when I looked at those numbers, I said it would fail. And so there's no reason to go out for a bond that's. That's likely to fail. Questions about this particular issue, about the total size.

start time: 184:59:14.000
end time: 191:43:56.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Yeah. Is it true too that we do have a limited capacity to get stuff done right. So even if we went for enough money to do everything, we wouldn't have time to do everything? Is that correct? As Dan said it would, you would just be stacking out projects over a longer period of time. So in another eight years we can go for more.

start time: 191:46:28.000
end time: 213:43:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Correct? Yeah, and we'll talk about that. Kind of like the duration. We think this bond will be here in a moment. But you are correct in this graphic here just alludes, I guess to the. To the memo. When we talk about capacity, there's three primary categories of our capacity constraints. One is like the project teams. We only have so many project teams, only so many project managers, only so many people on the site to manage the work, to manage the contracts. There's also internal staff support. So these large, in particular large projects, but all the projects require a lot of support from internal stakeholders, subject matter experts. People often think that when you're working on a project there's just one or two people making decisions and really it's dozens and dozens of people. And so we can really oversaturate both our internal team, also the support that's in pps, and then there's the third party which is a huge component outside pps, whether it be consultants or contractors or even authorities having jurisdiction, like the city of Portland being able to turn around permits. If we over saturate any one of those, we start to run into risks, both cost risks, schedule risks and ultimate what that final product is. If we start saturating two or three of those, which we can easily do when you're talking billions of dollars, then it just creates a very risky environment for completing projects on time.

start time: 214:56:10.000
end time: 229:56:32.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So I'll just weigh in. So this is on the target. So I would support this target for the primary reason that it allows us to finish the high schools. I can't imagine a scenario in which we went out for eight or longer years and we didn't finish the projects because we essentially would be telling, you know, one of the last few high schools that you're gonna have to wait at least another decade and I just don't think that's acceptable. So I would support the eight year but only because it allows us to finish what we, what we started.

start time: 229:58:16.000
end time: 230:29:52.000
confidence: 0.95
A: And you've actually jumped to the next item, right?

start time: 230:30:16.000
end time: 240:55:12.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I know, but I'm just trying to explain my rationale and also having looked at the polling and obviously talked to my neighbors the I think any sort of increases in taxes as you mentioned is a non starter. So this allows us that we already, I mean we have a very generous tax already that voters have approved and so renewing that existing rate to me is. I'm going to answer most of the questions just in one thing but because they all kind of package together. But I think if you did any longer or shorter it's you start losing.

start time: 240:56:16.000
end time: 244:16:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Support because they are interrelated. Dan, why don't you run through the next two, the bond drop rate and then also the tax rate and then we'll sort circle back around folks.

start time: 244:17:30.000
end time: 287:13:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Sounds good. So number two is the plan for an eight year bond cycle and what that means in other words is anticipate the next bond roughly in November of 2032, assuming we're staying on the presidential election cycle. This section of the staff memo gets pretty wordy. PPS began the current capital improvement plan in 2012 based on assumption of ballots every four years. However, those assumed smaller bonds, still significant bonds, but smaller general obligation bonds with a succession of very large bonds that we have and are contemplating now. PPS basically has enough capital or at full capacity for, you know, with what we're contemplating here, roughly the next decade. It's also worth noting that PBS is not required to decide when it's going to go out for a bond again if referring this upcoming bond. But it does help planning for projects in particular projects that are reoccurring such as curriculum adoptions or IT refresh cycles to know that there's an intention to go out in this amount of time. Then they can plan for all those cycles within that specific number of years. It also helps the finance team of how they're going to structure the bond sales. If they know there's a target for another bond in eight years, they can structure a reduction in the levy rate at that time. So that future bond isn't necessarily a full levy rate increase. It probably will likely be some increase, but it will help a future bond. So that isn't. You don't have to make a decision now. It's just helpful. And the district can change their mind. The district can also go out for bond anytime, but if it's in a shorter duration, it's going to be a tax rate increase. Number three was about retaining the existing rate. The primary variables when we're looking at financing general obligation bonds is the levy rate, the duration of the bond and the interest. This is the slide we've seen before, but it's just got more color on it. The two options that are highlighted, which are the D1 and E1, they meet the working assumptions of retaining the rate. Planning for another bond in 2032, so planning a drop in the debt and then totaling between 1.5 and 1.8 billion. So those are the. These all do nest together. So I think it makes sense to kind of run through and get the committee's feedback on all of those recommendations.

start time: 288:40:09.000
end time: 300:45:00.000
confidence: 0.98
A: So sort of open it up. Again, thoughts on, again, all of these things in terms of the total bond amount between 1.5, 1.8 billion. Planning for another bond and again, planning meaning, as you said, Dan, that we could go out in eight years without raising tax taxes. We could go out sooner than that. If the community would support a tax increase or a board in eight years could decide not to go out and could let the tax decline. All of those would be options. But from a planning perspective, that is what this sort of does. And then the question around the existing tax rate and maybe that's a. Maybe that's an easy one. I don't want to speak for my board colleagues, but do we have general consensus on the board that we are looking at maintaining the existing tax rate for this bond referral?

start time: 300:47:40.000
end time: 301:49:32.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I think that's what the community has been loud and clear about, not raising.

start time: 301:50:36.000
end time: 302:23:20.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Taxes at this time.

start time: 303:10:00.000
end time: 303:32:20.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Yes, I'm supporting.

start time: 303:43:20.000
end time: 303:53:36.000
confidence: 0.61
A: Yeah.

start time: 303:55:28.000
end time: 308:47:40.000
confidence: 0.99
C: Yes. Although I'm looking at these D1 and E1s, and the estimated total interest on those two is really different. I mean, we'd have.

start time: 309:26:10.000
end time: 309:35:38.000
confidence: 0.84
B: Yeah.

start time: 309:37:14.000
end time: 310:08:42.000
confidence: 0.99
C: So why would you do the one.

start time: 310:09:06.000
end time: 324:56:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: With the bigger interest just because you get more money? Good question. That's exactly right. So the E1 option is for the $1.8 billion. And again that assumes not increasing the tax rate and then building in a debt rate. I'm not sure what the right terms are. Andrew can probably help me with this. A drop in roughly 2032 that could support another bond in 2032. Lots of variables there. I wouldn't get too precise on the numbers. These are directionally accurate because there's lots of variables. And I know our financial advisors would caution to know that there's lots of decisions that can change or that can be made. But the higher the principal amount, if the structure is the same, then the higher the total interest cost.

start time: 325:17:00.000
end time: 336:29:26.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I would be interested for a future meeting. And I remember this from the previous analysis and I remember I had Patty's exact question. Proportionally D1 and E1 seem off to me. And so it would be great to ask Piper Sandler, our financial advisors, just for a little bit more detail, why is it that a 300 million dollar increase in the principal amount generates such a large interest change? Because it looks to me, I mean the approximate length of the debt, you know, you're issuing 28 year debt instead of 24 year debt. But also with an eight year drop, it's. I would just be curious. I'm sure there's a good reason for it, but if we could get a little bit more on that.

start time: 336:31:58.000
end time: 336:46:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: No problem.

start time: 337:08:30.000
end time: 337:34:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Just ask a really quick question.

start time: 337:49:50.000
end time: 338:26:16.000
confidence: 0.90
B: What was the polling around for like.

start time: 338:27:28.000
end time: 339:55:20.000
confidence: 0.91
A: For example, the B2 situation, you know, because there's way less interest payments, right?

start time: 339:56:00.000
end time: 341:17:28.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Just for a 50% increase. It's been a while since I looked at the polling data, so I don't.

start time: 341:17:44.000
end time: 351:04:30.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Remember what that looked like. Well, I was going to say, I don't think we pulled at that level of detail what I know we pulled. That was total amount and then the total amount of interest. And you know, the higher the amount, the lower the support and then the higher the amount of interest, then the lower support, which makes sense. These are pretty detailed and I don't think we pulled each one of these examples. Dan, am I, am I right? I mean the reason why the interest is so low on B2 is because that's a 16 year wait for the next.

start time: 351:37:30.000
end time: 353:28:24.000
confidence: 0.96
B: It's a 16 year wait and it includes a levy rate increase. If you can see the column. I can't.

start time: 353:29:12.000
end time: 353:56:56.000
confidence: 0.87
A: You're right. Sorry I missed that.

start time: 353:59:28.000
end time: 355:43:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: But I do appreciate, I also too have not looked at the polling data recently, so I appreciate Director Scott's better recall than mine.

start time: 356:20:00.000
end time: 391:37:30.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Does that make sense? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And what it just means, I mean, essentially if you don't go out for 16 years, you can pay off more of the principal up front. So you're paying, you know, less interest. So. And maybe I'll also just say generally, I mean, this is just sort of more the way I think about this. I mean, I think one of the, as we talk about finding this, this is really, it's a great chart because it really walks us through this balance of like, how much do we borrow, how quickly do we pay it back? Those are questions that everyone deals with. When you buy a car, when you buy a house, right. When you finance anything. The difference, I will say when it comes to public assets is there is a really good reason, reason to, to finance a public asset because it is intended to last for decades. And so one of the reasons why, you know, you would never want to take out a 30 year loan on a car, right? But you do take out a 30 year loan on a house because your house is going to last that long. Similarly with our buildings, obviously if we have the finances, the quicker we can pay it off, the better. It's lower interest rate, it frees up dollars rather than things, keeps tax rates lower. But it's also not a bad thing to stretch the payment out so that multiple. So because multiple generations benefit from the asset, that's one of the reasons why you finance things over a 20 or 30 year period of time. So there's not a right answer just from a public finance perspective in terms of getting there. But I think, and honestly the right answer also varies depending on the community you're in. I know there are some, I've been in conferences with, with some, I will call them just more conservative communities. They don't finance anything. They pay cash for, you know, everything right up front. That also means that existing current taxpayers pay the entire freight for something that, you know, residents of that community are going to benefit from 20 or 30 years from now. There are other communities that take extremely long debt out, which can really raise interest rates and you know, not raise interest rates, but raise interest payments. And so I think finding that balance is really what we're hoping to do in this process. I'm not sure Gary or Herman, if either of you, I don't see a hand up, just wanted to give you an opportunity on these questions.

start time: 392:01:50.000

confidence: 0.91
D: Yeah, yeah, I have a couple questions. I don't, I can't find my raised hand button all of a sudden. So a couple questions. One, you know, I know we talk about the polling. What was the Sample size of the polling.

confidence: 0.94
C: I'm going to find it. But I have my file here. I'll get it for you. Gary, it's like probably 500. I mean, it's created a statistically reliable sample.

C: 400 likely voters age 18 or older in the PPS district conducted June 25, the 27th, 2024. It's 4.9%, plus or minus. Thank you.

start time: 410:37:32.000
end time: 452:48:00.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah. And the reason why, the reason why I asked that is, you know, I know with polling, I've been talking to some national polling companies, you know, around the country who have done polling for, you know, President Obama and some other big, highly contiguous races and stuff. And so I just wanted to make sure that when we're talking about our polling, it's not the end all, be all. We're talking about a small sample, 400 something polling folks in Portland, you know, and we are really reducing. We're reducing a complex issue into some very general questions when to do the polling piece. So as much as I rely on, I think poly can help to help kind of give us a little insight. I don't want it to. I hope we don't use it as an end all be all because polling have been wrong as well. When we talk about tax rates, there was a big issue around the bond piece when it first came up about taxes. And the same argument we're talking about now where people didn't want to have their taxes raised, that came up then and we still passed one. So I don't want us to look at, you know, not doing something that it can't happen because we're fear of people not supporting or not or supporting or not supporting it. There wasn't support for the first from my regulation. I could be wrong, but I'm trying to remember the history of the first bond stuff that came out, the one that failed and the one that succeeded. And that same argument was people didn't want their taxes raised, especially the homeowner taxes raised. So I want us to come from, hopefully we can come from a mindset of abundance and people are going to try to make sure they do best for their kids because we've only had one bond passed. So when we look at historically, you know, even though they've been at the same tax rates, people have supported doing things that's best for their kids, are best for the kids in the community. So I want us to make sure that we're looking at what we can do and not looking at what we can't do. The other thing I was to say too is that this is a question for Dan. If we was able to increase our internal capacities, could more work get done or is that more based on the timeline of the school and the school schedule?

B: It's a good question. Kind of broadly, we can. When we have more scope, we look to staff up, but there are still limits. And something I'll notice is we've been trying to increase our capacity for years. We've had open positions, we're always looking for more to be able to complete more work. And so from a project team standpoint, I think there's more opportunity to increase capacity from kind of internal staff support. That gets a lot harder. You're touching a lot of different areas, lots of different departments, dozens of different individuals, or even more than that. And then certainly when it comes to that third party, that outside PPS capacity, that is harder to influence. The example I've used before, I think here is, you know, we run into contractor capacity almost every year with, like our roofing projects. We try to do four, five or six roofs every year. When we first, the first bids that go out there might get, you know, three or four bidders. By the time we get to the end, sometimes we'll get 1 or 0 and we'll mid in the situation where that very last bid is twice the number of all the other ones and then we, of course cancel that bid and go out again next year. So there are real constraints, both internal and external.

D: All right, thank you. I mean, I guess for me it will be, you know, I'm always going to try to get as much as we can get because what we are building for and what we are setting foundations for is our kids. And so, you know, as much as we can get, as much as we can do for our kids is always going to be my number one priority. Whether that's 1.5, 1.8 or 3, you know, or 5. I do want to take into consideration the constraints that our staff have, capacity wise as well, and make sure that we have a great balance of what we don't want to do is get too much money where we can't do it with, and then it dilutes a lot of the stuff that we should be doing. So as far as the 1.8 or 1.5 or 3 or whatever that number is, whatever that number is. I wanted to make sure that we will be able to complete the work and do the work and make sure that we are affecting as many kids as possible.

A: Great. Thanks, Gary. And I mean, I'll just add, I always love your optimism and actually the enthusiasm for keeping that sort of positive outlook about what we can do. And I think it's really important for me it's that balance of what we can do and also the potential risk. Right. You know, the, the bond in 2011 failed and then they. 900 votes, you know, by 900 votes, it's, it's not easy to. If you fail is a, is a huge deal. And it's a huge deal not only because we would have raised, you know, hundreds of thousand dollars for a campaign, gone through the whole thing, but rebooting it is. Is in. In and of itself. It's often more difficult to, to pass the second bond after a failure than the first one. And so that also weighs on me a little bit is finding that balance between what can we make sure we'll succeed this, this time around. But I, you know, you're. And actually, I think we're going to get to this a little bit, a little bit later. But the whole question of, of, you know, there's a lot of needs in the district. Right. And so, you know, the quicker move we move through them, the better it will be for our kids overall. Oh, the other thing I was going to say in terms of, of I also think the environment today in 2024 in Portland is different than it was, you know, five or eight years ago. I will just say there was a zoo bond on the ballot. Some of you may have seen this last election that it passed, but it didn't pass by very much in Multnomah county and like in the low 50s. And I will say it was a very small dollar amount compared to the Portland Public Schools bond, like on a per, you know, dollars per thousand dollar amount. And, and we have cute kids, but man, they have cute animals. And, and it was just, it was, you know, it's, it's a hard campaign in for anything, you know. And then that was also an existing tax rate. It did not raise taxes. So that those, those, those election results are a little bit of a warning sign to me to just again, be cautious and prudent with what we go forward with.

D: And I'm just saying I say this and then I'll be quiet. What's interesting with what got me is what after the levy passed, folks, was and it wasn't a whole lot. But I was getting comments from community members like why we didn't raise it, knowing that we had so much need for our teachers. And a lot of people had talked about they would have actually been willing to go up on their property tax. And this is like you said, these are some conservative folks who owned a lot of property in north and Northeast Portland. And they was actually surprised to me, they was actually wondering why we didn't raise it. They would actually support it because they knew what it was going for.

confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah, I was just going to say, also with the local option, it's very different historically passing a levy for teachers and school staff than it is passing a bond. And I will just say, as somebody who looks at polls all the time, like every year, every cycle, especially in Multnomah county, is the appetite for increases. I mean, there's been a whole host of increases to pay for needed infrastructure. And people I think are willing to continue to pay a pretty high rate. I mean, I tell people what our rate is for PPS for our bonds. Like, it's like, well, that's a lot. And so the continuation of like paying a fairly high rate is right now where voters are. And to Andrew's point, also having run lots of campaigns like the bigger the number, the more money you have to raise. There's just a whole host of complicating factors. And I'll tell you, having worked on the 2011 bond that didn't pass by 900 votes, that then created a reset. And I was around at the time, a future Cleveland parent, seeing the Cleveland high school modernization go down in 2011 and then not be included in the 2012 bond that passed. And then you have to wait another 15 years. And the same thing happened with Jefferson, waiting 10 years they were on that 2011 bond too, is, I think it creates a lot of uncertainty in our about what our planning process is and what we've prioritized in terms of long term facility improvement. If we lose a bond and then reshuffle things, I think it actually makes it harder to pass something, which is.

start time: 578:42:46.000
end time: 596:25:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Interesting because we passed all the bonds except for one. So if you look historically, I understand your fear of, well, if we do this or we do that and we pivot A little bit or we ask for more, it could go down. I understand that fear. But when I look at the actual reality of what's happened, we have always passed the bonds for our school. Except for that one time. I believe that was the first one and it was only 900 votes. So that could be attributed to communication. It could have been communicated to, you know, get out the vote better for those or better understanding. So because that's such a small number, it could have been contributed to a lot of little bitty factors. I just, I just, it just, it just. It's interesting that we are not thinking that people will do what they feel is best for their kids, grandkids and the overall Portland public school or city of Portland that that wraps around everybody in this community.

B: Yes. So this, this is the last sort of like the big four variables, the, that we wanted to see if we could coalesce around. And this is when to ask voters for authorization. This has partially come up. We'll go back a little bit. So the original plan was aiming for November of this year. In June there was a pivot to look at May of 25. There's some information in the stat about that. It's still tight. You're always going to want more, more time. But there's a lot to get done between now and what would be a May ballot measure. So some questions have come up about what an alternative would be and that would be to aim for the November of 25 instead of the May of 25. And so the memo gives some pros and cons of those which I won't get into here other than to say, you know, the big pro of moving to November is it just allows more time to develop the package, to engage the community, to do some more kind of high level district wide analysis. The con is significant in that the IWLS and Cleveland High School modernizations, they are already in design and they are partially funded from the 2020 bond for planning and for early design. They would run out of funds before November of 2025. Therefore, those projects would effectively have to be put on hold or some other very creative solution have to come up. So that would be the con. The staff recommendation is to proceed with May of 2025 and want to get the committee's feedback.

confidence: 0.96
A: So I really appreciated this part of the memo. I think you did a really good, nice job of laying out very objectively sort of the benefits of potentially waiting as well as the costs. And there are potential benefits of waiting. For me, the cost of, of delaying sort of the work that's already been done on Wells in Cleveland was, was significant and, and that is both in terms of maintaining our momentum.

A: We had talked about November 2024. We delayed it, I think rightfully, you know, to next year, but I think wanting to keep up the momentum and wanting to keep momentum on those, those, those schools and those efforts as well as Jefferson too, and, and actually these, the other pieces as well. I mean, it was Cleveland, it was Wells, it was Jefferson, but even the ERP project and some of the technology and curriculum projects, you know, we could probably bridge that gap, but it gets harder the longer we wait. So for me that was convincing in terms of May 2025. I think the committee should also, and the Entire board should talk about. You know, there are electoral considerations which staff don't take into consideration, but we should. You know, the May ballot is. Is May 2025 is arguably a little bit harder than it would have been in November 2024. It tends to be a smaller electorate, lower turnout, it's a little bit older, more homeowners, but may be easier than November 2025, which is an off year, November election. So I don't know what else would be on in November 2025, but there's not. There's not a lot on the ballot at that point. But sort of open it up for thoughts on the timing. I'm supportive of May 2025, and it.

C: Should be noted that in 20, the 2017 bond also had money for. It was like, I think a million for both Cleveland and IDB Wells. And then in the 2020 bond, when only Jefferson was in 20 million. A piece was put into both of those. So we've had two bonds that we're planning for. Those. Those two. I don't see a reason to. I mean, to me, when I look at the. I look at the list and we're actually making the list shorter, not longer, and we should be able to do that. And I mean, from my perspective, this is going to be sort of an essentials bond. And it seems like we know what the essential work is and we should, we should move ahead. I don't think we should delay. My experience over the last 25 years is, for example, coming out of the 95 bond, there was just like one thing after another that, like, oh, we can't go out for a bond because we've got X, Y, and happening. And pretty soon there wasn't a bond until 2011. I think we have the basis and the staff's done the work that sets us up well to go out and keep moving on this. And I'm just remembering all the committee meetings, Dan, where you said that the amount of money we had for some critical projects, roof failures, whatever they are, the things that came out of last year's storms and our infrastructure, that number was getting pretty small from the last bond and that we should refill that bucket of money that we know is super important just to keep sort of safe, warm, dry, accessible going. So I'm all for going in May.

B: It's a good question. I think the way that maybe the memo presented it and made it a little convoluted. It was the memos outline some pros and cons of if we were to push to November that would give more time that would elongate the projects that would be and design longer. They would be put on pause effectively. What would you do at that time? I think even as we get into design, we know that Cleveland is in a tricky location. It's right on a highway. It's not large enough to accommodate all of the amenities that it needs. And so what comes up from time to time is is there a better location? There is not an obvious better location. So the idea was well, if there was time we could do a more purposeful look to see if there is something that could be a better location. Again, there's nothing obvious that's out there, but that is what could be time well spent. Thank you.

B: Good question. When the Cleveland. So all the modernizations have a comprehensive plan that the board approves most of them that property is PPS controlled property. And so what the board approves is largely within our means to complete that scope of work. When the the Cleveland comprehensive plan was approved, there was a. We call the TERP alternate but that's not a great description but a separate piece an alternate that was for Powell park to put multi use fields there that is being designed. We are having conversation with parks. The team is also looking at potential other options other than just Powell park to see if there is a better solution for. Because Pell park is tight, you know it's not built for multi use athletic fields. So all those things are happening. So yes, those things. And ultimately before we get to the point in the project where we execute the contract with the contractor, we will need to make a decision of what exactly we want to go forward with that design or not.

C: I'll just say having been around, I'm sorry just as long as we're in athletics. Having been around the last several bonds is I think one of the things with the pressure to make sure that the school based learning environments were done is the sort of ed specs around. How do we create equitable, equitable playing fields for all especially in those high schools that have more compact or are adjacent to the city. So I'm thinking Grant, Benson, Lincoln is. We kind of left that like till later and it's turned out actually to be. I think if we're doing it now, it's like I think we should try and do things at the same time because trying to do it later, I mean as Director Green knows, trying to catch up with what Roosevelt should have got when which is, you know, what the other high schools now get. It's complicated to do it later and you're trying to add it in and it's like why didn't we get that when our high school was done? So I think it's better to try and move everything together because we're still dealing with, with the trailing pieces from Grant obviously from Benson and I think this Bond potentially do a little bit of catch up.

A: The other thing I'll just say about timing for the board to consider is it does, you know, a May 2025 referral is, you know, gives us some time for a campaign but it's going to be here before we know it. And you know, it's, you know, probably realistically need to raise 4 or $500,000 for an effective campaign to make sure it passes, which doesn't fall all on the board, it falls on the community as well. But sort of thinking about that and you know, are we giving ourselves enough, enough lead time because again, once we refer it staff don't touch it anymore. It's all on us and the campaign working with the community to really move this thing forward. And so that's something just also really consider as we talk about timing. So we have some people signed up for testimony. What I'd like to do is take some of that testimony and then come back and have a brief conversation about your last slide around sort of the overall priorities which again, is more of a preview, I think, for future meetings. But I think it'd be good to go over the information you presented in the memo, so be okay with that.

But we're still waiting at Cleveland and we've been voting in good faith to fund everybody else. So the condition of Cleveland is dire. We have collapsing ceilings in the cafeteria and the library, and we have mice in the cafeteria.

C: It requires students to go inside and outside the building to get to different classes. And I challenge anyone to find their way around the building unassisted. Heating and cooling is a real problem. And in addition, some classrooms are stocked with furniture that's appropriate for fifth graders, so it's even uncomfortable for me. My son is sixth grade feet tall. He has an hour and a half sitting in a little tiny desk that's good for fifth graders. In Portland, we're really good at remembering that taxes exist to serve our community. And we consistently vote to tax ourselves so that we can leverage our power to work on big projects that can't be accomplished just by a small group of people. The Cleveland neighborhoods have shown up to vote to fund all the other schools that came before us.

So for two weeks, I had to sit on the floor of a classroom in that same classroom because we don't have suitable AC. It got to 115 degrees that same year. I was in a classroom where it was 40 degrees. So our temperature regulations are just not suitable. It's not fair that kids at Grant get to go to school when it's too hot. But I have to go home because my school cannot facilitate my temperature needs. And we have been pushing this back forever and it cannot continue to be like this. It's not equitable.

B: Something north of $4 billion. That equates to roughly $100 million or so a year to just do regular upkeep, not addressing the things that already pass their useful life. Does that answer your question, Treasure Hollins?

start time: 1410:23:18.000
end time: 1454:44:50.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Absolutely. And so my comment is going to be to our board. Well, as we are, and I am all for making sure we get everything that was promised to the community for that to get done, we also have another responsibility to make sure that we're not putting future boards in the same position that we got put in by having all this deferred weakness that's coming up that we're not going to be addressing as well. And that's what I want to make sure. It's clear that we have almost $100 million a year in maintenance that comes up, and some of it is deferred to the next year. So we keep passing the buck down and down. I will implore us to at least look at how much we go out for without raising taxes, because none of the options that was on there raised taxes. So even if we did a $3 billion bond, I understand it goes out longer, but then we get to tackle a lot of the other deferred material maintenance that we have for all of our other elementaries, middle schools as well. We had an issue this year where we had a whole school or school or two schools that had to be relocated because of deferred maintenance. And so while we're talking about kids going to, you know, get that experience in high school, we have to get them prepared to want to continue with their educational experiences when they're in K through 8 to even want to get to the high school level piece. And so if we neglect them, and I understand that this is a long process, but I would just implore us to at least raise the amount we're going to go to the bond for without raising taxes to do that as well. It would, I would be. It would be, you know, when we talk about, well, this is an easy way, we don't have to do easy. Right. We need to do what's necessary for our kids at the high school level, at the middle school level, and at the elementary level as well. If we have an earthquake in five years, we have a potential of a whole bunch of other schools that could be in trouble. And while we're making decision today, we still have to be mindful of them tomorrow. And so at the very least, I would ask us to at least raise the amount that we're asking so for in our next bond, once again, without raising taxes. Because on part of the slide that was showed, we can ask for more without raising taxes. It would be very hard for me to support any campaign that we're not at least looking at that moving forward.

end time: 1460:36:02.000

D: Period. And if that means I have to campaign against it, resources, whatever I have to do to do that, that's fine, because I want to make sure that we're not just looking at our high school kids, but looking at all of our kids at the same time. And I think one way we can do that is at least raising the amount that we asked for on the bottom.

E: Good evening everyone. Again, I apologize for not being able to be there in person, but I want to also make sure that I've been listening and that I do chime in just so that everyone has a clear understanding of exactly what it is that I'm thinking in regards to this. I don't believe there was ever a moment where I didn't believe that we ought to do the high schools. I think what I believe, what I was trying to bring to the table is that we have a lot of other schools within our system that also need love and support. And I believe that it's absolutely imperative for us to bring up this conversation to the broader community so that the broader community has an opportunity to hear and to weigh in on why we are considering some of the things that we are considering. It's imperative to understand that as we're right now we're talking about, we're talking about making sure the last of our high schools get the level of modernization that, you know, that they need and that, and that what was a promise to them, because this is where the most of our students will one day end up. My concern is that if for, of the eight years of their 12 year education they are in broken, dilapidated buildings where it looks as though, and feels as though that we don't care about education as much as other school districts might, then we could possibly also lose students and families to some of our surrounding districts. We also have to keep in mind that as we're young people are, they're getting their, you know, the whole desire of wanting to learn, feeling comfortable learning and believing in the education system, that they're coming into spaces sometimes that don't necessarily show, don't necessarily show the same things that we are trying to project. One of the students that got up to speak this evening spoke about the rodents within the buildings. And that's. And I want to touch and agree with that student to say that that should not be the case for your, for your educational experience. And I also want to add to that that it's not just the high schools that are dealing with the rodents in the building and the infestation, that it's also our elementary and our middle school kids that are dealing with some of these same issues and they are dealing with these for a much longer period than, you know, just the four years in high school. Now for those that have dealt with it as this student was, I believe, trying to express that they, the student was. They went through our elementary schools, they went through our middle schools, they finished their high school. So their entire high school educational journey was one where, quite frankly, they had to deal with dilapidation and the lack of quality and the lack of service. And what I'm simply wanting to get on the table is the conversation around how much more could we do with some of our funds if we were to say, okay, yes, we are going to continue with our commitment to get all of our high schools done and we're going to somehow add in, figure out a way to make the tough decisions where we can also tackle some of our elementary and middle schools. I believe the question has already been answered around our deferred maintenance. And I know Markham was one of those schools where they were out of school for a while. I know Oakley Green is currently a school that has, well, that has been dealing with air and health and safety problems, which is also what I believe both the parents and the students are trying to bring to our attention right now, that the students that are going to high school and entering into these school buildings, they, from an equity perspective, they deserve some of the same liberties and freedoms of being able to have clean air, available space opportunities that all the other surrounding high schools have. My argument is going to be, or my question for the community is going to be, then what about our elementary and middle school kids? Do they not deserve these things? We brought up the concept or the idea that should an earthquake happen, that the student could have possibly died in the earthquake. And I want to continue on with that level of thinking to say, should an earthquake happen? High school student who is much more aware of his surroundings and what is going on, yes, they could and they're going to, you know, they're going to recognize it a lot sooner and they may or may not be able to get out of the building. Elementary and middle school kids are even less likely to make out of some of the same buildings that would be impacted by the same earthquake. So our elementary school kids, our pre K kids, our middle school kids, all of those kids that are in these dilapidated buildings are going to have a much less opportunity or less likely to make it out. And I know that none of us are thinking that we want this to happen. I'm saying since it was brought up, let's not just simply think about it from the perspective of a high school student. Let's also think about it from the perspective of the pre K kids. The elementary kids and the middle school kids who will be in our dilapidated buildings at the exact same time. And those buildings are just as old, if not older than our last two high schools. So does this not bring into question for some of us who are forced to have to decide and to think about these things, what are some possible alternatives, tips that might be able to not eliminate it, but possibly reduce it? And that's what we're trying to get on the table. What we're trying to get on the table is a conversation, or at least I am. What I'm trying to get on the table is a true real life conversation around how are we going to deal with the dilapidated buildings that our kids are going to spend the next eight years in? Instead of just going with the easy answer of because people are coming out and they're complaining, let's just say, okay, and we're not going to do it. Let's push back a little bit because I believe in pressure. Let's push back a little bit and let's talk about yes and instead of but. And so those are, those are my two cents to it. But I do love this conversation. I love that we're having it and I just wanted us to have it a lot more.

A: Thank you. Thank you, Director Green, for that. Okay, we're 40 minutes over the time originally allotted for this committee meeting and we're going to have more. So that's why I'm going to go ahead and wrap us up because we can have more of this exact conversation. What I heard tonight is that there is not board consensus around the amount, although a majority did indicate the 1.5 to 1.8 million. But I think it's a question we'll come back and consider. There was consensus around existing tax rate, keeping that where it is. There was. There are general consensus around May 2025 and I think the total dollar amount in the overall cycle for the next bond are somewhat related. So we can, we can put that on for another meeting as well. And then I did hear a majority of the board express preference for option number number one, but some strong preferences for other options as well. So I'd also like to put that on a future committee conversation just more to dive into the details just a little bit more. And really? Yeah. Dan, I'll just tell you this because you happen to be sitting up there. I would love to dive into more of the details of and I think the committee at a future meeting in terms of each one of these, just breaking them down a little bit more. Sort of what's, you know, to director medwards comments around what's in the technology, you know, what's in the deferred maintenance, what does that include the curriculum conversations and then and then the high schools as well. And I know that we are working on you. You're working with an outside consultant to look at these questions of costs. Why are costs higher in Portland and what's explainable and maybe what do we need to scrub a little bit more? I would also note there's a contingency in here that's sizable, as it should be at this stage. So good job for including a sizable contingency. Ideally we won't have to spend that, you know, on the buildings themselves, which means there might be, you know, some additional money that could go for other things in there as well. So we can dive into that a little bit more and then come back and talk about what the long term plan is because I think you have heard that from everybody, including director Screen and Hollins in terms of, you know, what is our long term plan for our buildings overall. So you got some of the answers tonight that I think staff are looking for and I think we'll have a conversation in the next meeting about more of them.
