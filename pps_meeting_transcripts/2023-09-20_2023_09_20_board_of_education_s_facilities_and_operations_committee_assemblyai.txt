A: A call to order the facility of operations committee meeting between the 20, 20, 23. We have. We have three things on the agenda. One has already been done, so we'll take off the update. And so today we'll be talking about the Wicker Adams property. And it actually be taking a bolt on that today to send to the full board. I'm going to be talking about the Jefferson High School modernization as well. And that's it. So those are try to be out here by 6:00. We will have some public comments. I don't know how many we have. Three slots, two minutes each. We might depend on the timing. We have an additional time. We potentially give a couple more people some time, but then it'll go down to about one minute. You know, that's kind of how we do that today. All right. Yes.

A: So I'll start out today. But this is a topic that has came up a while back in 2019, I brought a bobo to the school district and building a sports complex and learning facility for our kids through different iterations and different things coming up. Like where we going to Tubman? We kind of paused on it because we wanted to make sure that we had space for our Tubman kids if need be. If they were going to be on that space, then we're going to use that space for Tubman. Since we have found a space for Tubman, we bring it back up. So I want to start with. Okay, so I want to just kind of share just a brief. And a lot of people have already seen this already, but a brief presentation. I know I usually say five slides. Five slides. So what I did is I broke it up into two presentations. I will try just to use five slides for these as well. And then after presentation, my goal is to ask the committee to. For the resolution that we have to the full board. And I just kind of give a little sense of what the resolution is without going through all. All of them. I go through a little bit part of the recital. So. In the late 60s, Porter Public Schools used eminent domain to displace enough individuals and businesses in order to build out of high school. So it wasn't just like albino neighborhood. This was happening in other neighborhoods as well. You know, there were 26 homes that got demolished, duplexes, businesses, the nurseries and the community did not want this to happen. There was a lot of, of course, you know, resistance to this happening but within the domain that happened anyway. And so in 1969 Adams High School opened up. They brought in around 50% of students from Jeff from Grant from Madison and for this new high school. So it was around 50% African Americans at the time. Due to the kind of enrollment and you know, other district things. Adams High schools closed and then Whitaker Middle School came about in 1983. At that time, Whitaker had around 77% of kids of color. At that time due to a lot of the. Between 1990 and 2000 there were a lot of environmental issues that happened. There was mold, radon and it got to a point where the design of the building would not allow for remediation of the issue without it being really expensive. And so they closed the school down and then they demolished the building. And I think it's 2001. So since then this has been an empty lot up to that point. So that's where kind of where we started at a little bit about what we're. Who we are. Well, maybe explain Frank. So let me explain two of these two. One is I am also the Ed of Albino Sports program program. So organization go through this. I've been around since 1960. I did not intend the program. I am an ED. I'm a not a Ed of the program volunteer. And so I want to get that out there because I know people talk about conflict of interest and it's been vetted that it's not conflict of interest because I don't get paid here or I don't get paid there either. So I do a lot of volunteer work but a lot of it is around our kids. So let's just kind of just go into a little bit of what the sports complex is and then the next slide we're going to go into why the who and why. Let me skip all that. So right now this is the location that is on the left is a. This empty lot that's been there for over 20 years. Now to the north of that is the track and field which is owned by Portland Parks and Recs. And then to the west of that where the baseball diamond is, is also owned by Portland Parks and Recs. And then the park on the south end is owned by pbs. On the right is what we're proposing. You can go to the next slide. So you can go to the next. Okay, so what we're proposing is an indoor outdoor course complex and learning center. It's going to have, you know, potentially 12 basketball courts, 300 meter indoor track, volleyball courts, outdoor stadium, for football, soccer, two baseball fields, two softball fields, another soccer field to the west of the baseball diamonds. So when we, when we first presented this to the district at the time, and this is now pre Covid cost, we had estimated to be around 175 to 200 million. I'm sure the cost has escalated since then. So we have to look at what that new cost will be. Give me a skip that. I think that's it for now. Yeah. And this is just some architectural drawings that we had of what it would look like inside. Would it be looks at state of the art using timber connect with the outdoor. So if you look. Can't see from here, but if you look on the right side there's a basketball court that is divided by trees that actually goes up through the roof. And then on the other side there's another basketball court. That's it. I think that's the English. The next one. Yes. Okay, so the next slide we're going to see. So I'm trying to keep track of how many slides I. I looked at or explained.

A: No, I said I gotta explain. So in 1965, an educator who actually working at PPS by the name of Phil Walton started a Binance sports program. It's a nonprofit organization that was created to steer black and brown kids into organized sports where historically they was given unequal access to sports. All right, so this is. And his wife, she's still alive. He's passed on. So coach Phil, he was just an awesome guy. He did this stuff relentlessly. He didn't ask for money or dollars to do this stuff. You know, he grew up here. He went to Lincoln on high school, you know, the Portland State. He served our country in 1946. And then after his service he came back to Portland and he taught at different schools. Some of these schools, I don't even know the name is still the same, but some of the schools like James John Wood Bond Sunnyside. So he was active participant within EPS part of the EPS factory. He also became the superintendent of Oregon State Prison System in Salem. And I think one of the things that he always talked about is catching kids before they get there. And I think that was one of the motivations of him starting. Of course he got a lot of awards and accolades the previous. I mean some of the mayors that was in here had gave him, you know, Phil Walton's day. Mayor Bud Clark. So he was known for doing a lot for our kids. And his mantra was that once I'll buy a Kid, always. I'll buy the kid. And. And that really stood true because this is a more of a generational organization. These are some of the kids that have been a part of. So the gentleman on the right who's pointing, he was actually one of the first Walton kids when he was young. And this is how generational is. He was a track coach at Benson for 20 some years. And a lot of these kids here are great, great grandkid of people. Phil Walton did coach when he was alive. I can go to the next one and I did want to do some little throwbacks because this is another coach on the right hand who got the Vincent shirt on. He was actually a coach. He's the head coach of Benson High School. He was one of the first ones that Phil Walton coached when he was young and kind of give a little context. So then I know when my generation came, we ran for Ms. McKenzie, my kids ran for Albina and there's a lot of grandkids running for Albina at this point. So this is a very generational organization. Let's get to next. So I don't know if you can see, but these are some throwbacks to some old pictures in the 60s and 70s and 80s. And so when I say it's generational, it's generational. One of his slogans was we don't die, we just moved apply. And then there's a lot of different stories about the sacrifices Mr. Walton done. All the stuff that he's done with all these groups and teams he did out of his own pocket. He used to go pick up kids, pay for entry fees, pay for travel. He did all that out of his own pocket majority of the time. A little bit about buying a sports program today. So today we serve around 85% kids of color. We have served thousands and thousands of PPS kids. That's of course where we started from. Pre Covid, 75% of our kids was free. Reduced lunch was around 56, 44% females. The males that participated in our organization, Alvina serves over around 1600 kids a year. And a lot of that comes from our registered kids and the all comer meets we put on every year and we put on about six to eight of them every year. One of the big things that we pride ourselves is we've never turned a kid away because of finance, because of their financial situation, their parent financial situation. If a kid comes and wants to join, we figure out a way to take care of them. That means what is traveling to meets, flying to meets room and Board, we take care of that. That way the kid, we do it for their family as well. So as an example, if you look at the last page last year for that between 22 kids to nationals and within North Carolina, we paid out of our pocket probably about a third of that for kids and their families to go. We don't, like I said, we don't let money be a financial issue, a barrier why they can't participate. So you know, when we talk about what we're doing now, we view ourselves as an official part of the pps. Already a lot of our kids participate, go to our, both of these schools. Majority of them go to PPS schools. You know, and then we have some folks that have been real players, whether in sports with J.J. bergen, NFL players, you know, Makai Williams, he's just a woman who just came out this late to the Olympics. One of the youngest kids out of the Olympics league with a pps, I mean Albino kid and a PPS kid and he went on to Desert High School. All right, that's it. All right. So the, the purpose of all this to show and to see that you know, Alvana Sports Complex and Learning center can actually be a real benefit for our PPS teams. There's a lot of advantages with this conference could produce and we just goal is to hope that we can pass a resolution so we can move forward in that hopefully unified movement forward. So that's it for my presentation. Any questions?

confidence: 0.92
A: So you're right. And so the outdoor space which was south north of the main space is owned by Parks and Recs. And so it will be another partnership with them as well to have. I've been having conversations with them. Nothing is set in stone but we've been having conversations with them as well for them to invent to allow us to do this as well. Which would actually give. Based on our long term facility plan, you know, with the Whitaker side that it stands, it stands at 10.4 and we're able to do this with parks. You know we almost have a little over 20 some acres of field space that we can actually buy for our kids but it's not included in.

start time: 298:26:30.000
end time: 309:31:30.000
confidence: 0.90
B: I think we should note that in the resolution because also if the slides are used again but that should be noted because it's just not our PPS property that we can the other thing is that I would offer a friendly amendment. Well that's one thing and I guess somebody can draft it but to note the piece about the PPR the other friendly amendment I would offer is there be a number six on.

B: There's a total count the slide that has the working team the my name as a supporter and I want to just make sure that from a either perception but I wasn't involved in together the presentation or on a particular organized team. I support more athletic facilities. It's been worked that for 20 years in PBS. So I support that I want just to be clear in case there was a question that my work on this presentation article 17 is how negotiated or put something together Just to be clear.

confidence: 0.91
B: I guess this would be so the committee make a makes a recommendation for consideration. But one thing anytime you have a large potential transaction it's not transaction but use that I would expect we didn't ask staff wasn't asked to present anything or prepare anything I would ask that we ask staff review the resolution if there's anything board to be aware of in terms of any other provisions or ongoing discussions about anything that I would want to make sure that just having discussion in the back consider as part of.

D: Yes, thank you. So we provided an update, a brief update at the last Facilities and Operations Committee meeting. And we noted that we had a couple meetings that were coming up after that. We want to provide another update here tonight. We have two of our project team members here today, Project Manager Keisha Locklear and Steve Ephros. We have some illness going around, so we're not a full compliment tonight. So I think what we're going to do is there is a memo in the materials. Hopefully everyone had an opportunity to review. There's also lots and lots of attachments to be able to go through all of those. But we're going to provide a quick update and then we'll answer more questions. So Keisha and Steve.

end time: 433:07:30.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Yeah, I'll keep it up. Again, Steve Ekra, senior Project Manager in the Office of School Modernization. So as you've probably seen in the memo that was provided to you, we began with a bit of a background on where we are. So as you probably are aware, our initial pricing on the Jefferson project several months ago came in significantly over budget of what the board had approved. So we.

start time: 433:16:30.000
end time: 436:28:50.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Yes, when the approval based on information in December, but when that information based on your guide should be.

start time: 436:35:10.000
end time: 503:17:46.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Yes, on the initial recommendation, yes. So at that point we commenced a pretty exhaustive a week long value engineering workshop bringing in community representatives. And that exercise brought us from $270 million over budget to within about 5 to $10 million over budget. So we're continuing to work on our path towards budget. But I just wanted to kind of give you that initial background. So one of the most significant outcomes from that exercise was the clear need to move staff and students off of the site during construction, which will begin in 2024. So we proceeded with looking at relocation options and those included Kenton, pcc, Cascade and Marshall. So as we evaluated each of them, it became clear that Marshall was the best choice overall. And really drilling into that a little bit, a swing site has specific requirements in terms of academic, athletic, cafeteria, theater, assembly, administrative and partner spaces, among many other requirements. So starting with Kenton, as you are aware, it's an elementary, formally elementary school. It was significantly too small and there was really no way that we could make that work. PCC also doesn't work for similar reasons with limited number and types of available program space. And I'll talk about that in a little more detail in a moment. But we began by communicating with the Jefferson staff and the community about this decision and presented this information to the Steering committee, the Design Advisory Group and the Bond Accountability Committee. At the same time, we've also begun to meet with important community partners like SEI to socialize and really have get as much input as early as possible on this process. And we'll have additional engagement with other community support groups like Latino Network and Indian Education. Additionally, we also plan to bring the Jefferson Journalism class into this process to increase student awareness on this issue. But as you saw in the memo, we wanted to really clarify an important issue and that has to be its owning and the fact that zoning was not the only reason that the PCC Cascades option wouldn't work. So just to be really open about this, PCC has been extremely hands on and involved with PPS in these conversations in this process, helping us analyze our needs with their spaces available. And they also agreed that they just don't have the capacity to make a full swing at PCC Cascades of possibility. Additionally, as we've had internal conversations with internal stakeholders, there are numerous challenges to PPS to just address basic operational needs of a full swing onto the PCC site and those include school lunches, safety and security, technology and other issues for high school students being full time at a PCC campus. So while the PCC option is not possible, staff is working together with PCC to consider expanding the middle college program and partnership and class offerings that really could create a scenario where both juniors and seniors could have less travel time. Jefferson at the Marshall campus and the PCC campuses. So that idea is currently in process. We'll be keeping the community engaged and updated on those developments. I want to hand it over to Keisha to kind of expand on that.

start time: 503:18:58.000
end time: 580:30:29.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Yes, again, Keisha Locklear Project Manager with OSM so to Sue's point, our team has been developing an FAQ so that we can gather all of this information and communicated to the to the Jefferson community. That was recently posted on the Jefferson website. We just received translations for that faq. So now we'll be emailing that out to the to the community at large very soon. So one particular issue that we know is a major concern, understandably is transportation, as with all other modernizations, and we will provide multiple transportation options. That work is also in progress and we plan to provide more specific information by the 8th grade information night at the latest, which I don't know the date. So also our team is currently developing ways in which we can introduce the Marshall campus to the JET community. Some current ideas are to create like a 3D video walkthrough or provide tours to, you know, for families to familiarize themselves with the Montreal campus. We also plan to work with our partner orgs like SEI and Latino Network and you know, Indian Education, all our partner groups so that we can ensure that we meet their needs while they're swinging on that location. So and as with all previous modernizations, our OSM staff is working closely with other modernization teams like the Benson team who is currently sworn at Marshall to learn from, you know, lessons learned about that and also so that the Jefferson High School Admin and staff can help us ensure a smooth possible transmission to the Marshall campus and to return back to the newly modernized, modernized Jeff so while all that work is in progress by staff to prep for moving to Marshall, the Jefferson modernization design team has been working intensely on the revised design strategy. There is still a lot of risk at this point in the project with the budget, but we are seeing focus and working with our internal and external partners to ensure that we maintain the budget. The City of Portland Bureau of Development Services has been extremely helpful towards making this project a success with we have bi weekly meetings with them to discuss various project design variables so that we don't run into issues later once we submit for permit. We have just completed schematic design as of Friday. I'm deep into review on those documents and we're moving right into design development. So our contractor design team have actually been working very closely together. Our contractor team has people on site at our architect's office, Mendoz and that is also to ensure that the design stays track stays within the budget. We have also begun the RFP process for our mechanical, plumbing and electrical candidates and our first selections in those trades will happen literally any day now. We expect our next updated round of pricing by the end of October from our contractor and our independent estimator. But those new trade partners are bringing on board will kind of help dial in those numbers, help the contractor team to dial in those those estimated numbers as well and also help the design team develop, you know, better cost effective design strategies. But our project team is very excited about how the design is developing and how we've been able to bring it back to budget and keep this project alive. And we really look forward to presenting to the community the updated project scheme at our next bad meeting. I think it's currently scheduled for October 19, but we will be sending out.

D: One of the things I want to also clarify is like, you know, I have taught in a building that was under construction. It's one of the most disruptive experiences imagined. So less years is better. The other question I have is that, you know, unlike Lincoln, which they kind of built a new building right next to it, and then they moved them out, switched sports field. The reason we don't do that, Jefferson, is because the historical phase. Right.

And one of the highest values that came out of that was retention out in 19. So that was what the original scheme was. And why won. Why that was, what was the original.

end time: 643:31:16.000
confidence: 0.86
A: Okay, so this. So this. We don't have a problem. So we're having this conversation and everybody know there's going to be questions. So, you know, doctors and. Hey, you guys anticipate questions? Yeah, and anticipate questions that might come up. Enrollment would have been a big thing that they've been talking about enrolling people. Even I find it very frustrating that we ask questions that do you need that should have been. And you don't have the people here to answer them. Because if you don't have to do this, you ask questions. I mean, I guess my thing is what's the point of this? You don't have the people here to answer the questions.

start time: 643:34:28.000
end time: 649:56:54.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Well, I'm. Sometimes I don't think you're gonna have every single. Be able to answer every single question or have the data to answer every single question. I'll say from my experience in this project and from what I've learned from those stakeholders that I've been in meetings with, that enrollment will be affected. I can't say that anyone has established any thresholds to date.

start time: 649:57:42.000
end time: 650:21:10.000

end time: 658:47:40.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Schools and how many people needs to kids be there in order to be comprehensive and to get the things that they need. So once again, this is why making sure we have the right people here to answer these questions. It's important because I don't like asking questions that don't get answered. Especially when I put out there, you know, hey, you guys, there's going to be questions answered. You ask. One of the big ones is enrolling. So I would. It just makes sense to have the people here to answer the questions.

confidence: 0.90
D: I just want to like. One of the things that is linked in the memo is when it happens is an faq and it has. It answers some of those enrollment questions. It doesn't answer that specific one. And I apologize. There was a specific. If there was a question that came in, I may have missed it as well, about enrollment. So I'll move.

A: One more and then we'll move down. Down the line. So what they knew I Can't remember what report I was looking at here. Under the BAC reports, it looked like they're going to. With the new design of compression of the sites, is that. Are we going to be. From what was told to us at these meetings and at the board meetings, is it going to be compression because we're trying to stay on the budget?

start time: 688:54:00.000
end time: 692:38:42.000
confidence: 0.95
E: No, we just. Well, I mean, it was. We were looking for ways in the value engineering workshop week how we could reduce the budget. Yes. And so one. One of the ways.

start time: 692:39:46.000
end time: 693:00:34.000
confidence: 0.83
C: And it wasn't just the budget, it.

start time: 693:00:42.000
end time: 696:05:50.000
confidence: 0.99
E: Was also because we needed more space for loading and for the field and exiting. There were transformers. There were multiple reasons why the building got compressed a bit.

start time: 696:10:50.000
end time: 696:37:22.000
confidence: 0.96
A: How much was that compression?

start time: 696:39:46.000
end time: 697:13:10.000
confidence: 0.99
E: It was like 10 or 15ft.

start time: 697:30:50.000
end time: 698:49:50.000
confidence: 0.88
A: So on the original thing, it was like 300 and I'll say 80 some thousand.

start time: 699:07:30.000
end time: 701:22:30.000
confidence: 0.98
E: And now we're basically right in line with the square footage that was approved at the board meeting, about 335,000.

start time: 701:42:10.000
end time: 723:56:18.000
confidence: 0.93
D: And I think to add to that, the. The advantage of not having students on site and not swinging on site is initially it was a phased approach where we had to build essentially a comprehensive phase one building that could accommodate the 600 or so students and all of their programmatic needs. So that created inefficiencies within that building and within the original 1909 building. So as soon as students are off site, we can be much more efficient in how we lay the building out. We actually went from three stories down to two stories on the addition, so that it's just a more efficient building, easier to kind of move through. And then the 1909 building became. Instead of walking along the main hallway and only having classrooms on one side, it became a double load. It's just a conventional classroom building. So overall, it has both budgetary but also practical efficiencies, which obviously have budget impacts. But it also makes it easier for students to kind of move through the building on a daily basis. So it just brought those benefits. With all of the original programs still in intact, in terms of the overall size of those spaces, it's. Okay. Director, I was going to respond to the threshold question. Unless you had something to add to.

start time: 724:47:22.000
end time: 725:10:42.000
confidence: 0.82
C: Yeah, well, I'm going to riff off.

start time: 725:11:06.000
end time: 726:09:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Of that, so go ahead and.

start time: 726:24:10.000
end time: 733:32:30.000
confidence: 0.89
D: Okay. Well, I mean, my question is actually more for the board members, so I was thinking this may be a good question to punt to the Student Success Committee. One of the reasons is because I am very concerned with the enrollment at Jefferson, because When you have low enrollment, that affects programming and robust and stuff. And we're not doing anyone a service if we don't have good enrollment, good robust programming, which is something that actually.

start time: 733:33:10.000
end time: 812:28:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: My questions are going to dovetail into your question because some questions about enrollment as well and about also the educational programming, which I recognize the project management facilities team is not going to be able to answer. And what I would. What I suggest is instead of having a separate committee discussion, is just have the combined committees, which may be close to visible on the full board together versus having two separate discussions because I think they're very integrated. That would be my suggestion. And then. But maybe the thing to do because, well, it looks like I think we have everybody in the room that we need to have in terms of like, how do we build the thing. But there's a lot of other. Especially about the recommendation to go to Marshall. I think there's a whole other set of questions that we need answered because this is a surprise. So my enrollment questions. And I'll just get them out so that we have them out there to add on to yours. Chair Hollins is. I would want to look at what the attrition was for Grant, not so much Franklin, because frankly, Marshall is consolidation of Franklin and Marshall. So it's a lot of kids that was their neighborhood high school anyway, so it's a little bit different. What was the attrition rate we had at Grant when Grant went there? And then what was the attrition rate for Benson? Recognizing that, we also made a really big investment out there in some CTE space for Benson and recognize that, I mean, that probably the closest comparison is Grant, but it's not even the same. Because one of the things that's unique about Jefferson is it's a high school in which every student's offered two different places to go and Jefferson is just one. So they have an automatic default versus Grant. It's not like if Grant students didn't want to go to Marshall, they could just pick another school. Every student at Jefferson has that choice. And I do think that will make things different. So I'd like to see what the attrition was already for these other schools, knowing that for Benson, which again, that doesn't have an enrollment, neighborhood enrollment, but we did do some things like this is specific to your program that we're putting at the Marshall site. It was not an insignificant investment that attracted people there. So I'm pretty concerned where people are like, hey, I can just go to McDaniel, Grant or Roosevelt, because I Already have that option. And I'll just sit there and then I'll wait for the new school to be built and then I'll go back to Jefferson. So that's an enrollment concern and I'd just like to see some more of the data and potential projections of what we think might happen. I have questions about pcc. So I had a conversation with Commissioner Rubio, not for that purpose, but just as it came up in conversation. Who's the commissioner in charge that would deal with the zoning design and everything else and there hadn't been a request. So I think we just should make sure that we're clear that we haven't asked for that. And if that becomes like a primary driver that either zoning or whatever, why we can't do it, something with a city that we should ask the city if. And have them tell us no without saying they told us no without us asking. So that would be, I think, one thing I want to put on the table. And then the question, the educational questions I have, and I'm not really asking these questions because I know they're not in your space, the educational question I would have is I'm curious about the middle college program. And I'm not suggesting this, but I'm just wondering, so students would be going back to PCC for PCC classes. Why wouldn't there be something where they had dual credit classes like they have at a lot of other high schools where you're actually getting community college credit.

start time: 812:49:50.000
end time: 813:51:02.000
confidence: 0.84
E: Facilities while they're not at pcc, but.

start time: 813:51:26.000
end time: 838:26:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: While they're in their classroom? Right. So for example, at Franklin you can take dual credit and get the PCC credit, but you're, you're at a, your home high school. So that would be a question I have because I don't understand why students would be going back to pcc. And then the other thing is, I would just want to see. There's going to be trade offs in every decision. And some decisions were, some trade offs were made that I think we need to make more transparent about why things weren't chosen. Like, for example, the science labs. I don't know enough about science and what's required. Eddie probably knows this as a high school teacher, but I don't know what, like the science labs that PCC has, why they're not appropriate for high school. And so I think answering some of those questions, like what's if you haven't. Jefferson's an open campus. What's different about the safety and security for students, say if they're at PCC then at Jefferson, when at lunchtime they can just log out of the building and be walk over to pcc. So those are the types of things that I need to understand to understand why the PCC is like not a valid option.

C: At pcc.

start time: 839:59:24.000
end time: 863:05:48.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Well, they just don't have the space. They don't have the space to swings the karmic moment. That's just. It wasn't the zone like it was. It was an error in communication strategy to lead with the zoning as the reason why, you know, just one of the reasons why it didn't work. The main reason why PCC doesn't work is because they don't have the capacity to hold, to hold our current enrollment. Not just from a classroom standpoint, but from all the support spaces standpoint like theater, assembly, dance studios, athletic fields, etc. They don't have the typical spaces and sizes of spaces that we would need to support the full enrollment initiative. We, like I had mentioned, we are currently planning a staff meeting with many different departments to try and work out a situation where perhaps juniors and seniors would spend full days on ECC's campus for maybe one or two days out of the week and then they wouldn't have to travel back and forth from PCC to Marshall within the same day. So that that meeting is. We're just trying to coordinate everyone's schedule.

end time: 863:21:48.000
confidence: 0.81

end time: 865:46:52.000

E: So it's going to happen the next week or so. So. But yeah, PCC just does not have.

start time: 865:47:16.000
end time: 868:37:50.000
confidence: 0.91
D: The space to swing jets that scenario. And I'm saying this is the total cap, but they're more or less thinking that capacity wise is somewhere from 80 to 100 students.

start time: 868:39:50.000
end time: 868:51:30.000

A: Yeah.

start time: 868:57:10.000
end time: 871:40:50.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Not full 600. I'm not saying that that couldn't be a little higher than that, but it's really just for those limited general ed classrooms.

start time: 872:13:10.000
end time: 872:49:34.000
confidence: 0.98

start time: 872:51:42.000
end time: 875:35:50.000
confidence: 0.87
D: That's all really. There's not necessarily all the general ancestors, but we're looking to see if we can accommodate as many as 80 to 100 kids in the country.

start time: 875:58:10.000
end time: 877:46:18.000
confidence: 0.88
B: So because when I asked the question you answered for a full swing. Is there a partial swing option?

start time: 877:49:14.000
end time: 881:13:10.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. This like, potential for one or two days of the week to have about 80 to 100 students there.

start time: 882:01:00.000
end time: 884:01:56.000
confidence: 0.90
D: What is the, the maximum of that PCC? Is it 8 to 100 or is it like what's the maximum they can hold?

start time: 884:03:08.000
end time: 888:39:10.000
confidence: 0.93
E: This is a, this is a new idea that we're. That we're fleshed at, you know, Margaret Calvert brought to the table and she has spoken with me about the idea. And so now we're just trying to get everyone into the table to figure out the actual needs and logistics of this idea.

start time: 888:40:30.000
end time: 892:42:54.000
confidence: 0.90
D: Okay. I guess my question was more just like, because we know that there's going to. There's probably going to be attrition during the move. But like, if there was only if the enrollment of Jefferson is like 400, do you feel swinging or 300?

start time: 892:45:42.000
end time: 893:32:50.000
confidence: 0.98
E: It's 534. That's verified.

start time: 893:54:30.000
end time: 907:40:10.000
confidence: 0.91
D: The intention is that there's already students that take classes at pcc. So is there an opportunity to expand that or even consolidate? So some students, seniors, for example, maybe they spend all of Monday, if you on that site, but they still need all the other spaces to provide a comprehensive high school of which PCC doesn't have. So there isn't a scenario where there'd be a student that has their home base is at PCC and they don't go to Marshall. It's just if there are students that are taking quite a few classes at these, can there be days where they are dedicated there? Also looking at potential other events that can be held at the site. They have some athletic facilities, basketball games, volleyball games, other events PC is amenable to that. We don't have agreement now, but those are the type of things that we're looking at to have students in the neighborhood as much as possible.

E: So I have a lot of concerns, and I mean a list of concerns, mostly about, I mean, globally, about the harm to the community and wanting the community, like expecting the community to bear the brunt of yet another movement. Especially after we just laid out, you know, with the Albina, this plan. We talked about the eminent domain being used and people being moved around. I'm really concerned about that. I don't know that this community can withstand additional harm. And if we were going to grade ourselves on this, frankly, I mean, we'd get an F. We would not be able to. It's not a winning strategy, I think, to move the kids off. I also, I thought that when we, we went through a CMGC procurement process that I thought would result, would avoid the scenario that we're in, that we would have somebody from the contractor available in these discussions to sort of have their ears and eyes open to potential of, you know, moving the kids off or not. So I have a concern about, like, are we doing things in the right order when we have a CMGC and we have an architectural group working through like programming and schematic design. We should have had the contractor. I think we might have the schedule on hiring and procuring a contractor. I felt we should have had a contractor on site earlier.

B: Just for community purposes.

start time: 938:11:34.000
end time: 1478:58:30.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Maybe we should explain what this A CMGC is a construction management general contracting. It's a different procurement that public entities can use for a lot of different reasons. My understanding is that doing a CMGC process prevents a public entity from building an RFP and sending it out to bid and then having to use the lowest bid. Basically, you know, work with that. I want you to put a pause on the process to find a community informed solution. An example would be to use a combination of Kenton and PCC and portables on the Kenton campus, which has room for that. The modernization committee has misled us repeatedly and we don't trust them. They promise to keep our kids on or near Jeff. I don't want my child in an unreinforced building, but I want her close not 11 and a half miles away. The modernization committee is deliberately wasting time with obfuscation to push Marshall onto a community whose number one priority is to keep our kids close. We understand that it's about the numbers, but you're not saving money by moving Jeff kids to Marshall. You're transferring the financial burden to a community that is under resourced and least able to shoulder it. Transferring the financial and logistical burden onto the Jefferson community contradicts the District's racial equity goals. PPS has a racial equity policy goal of providing equitable access, even when that means differentiating resources to accomplish the goal. The time to differentiate resources is now. Why is PPS urgently focused on equity when it's about grant athletes going seven miles for sports but not for our kids who would have to go over 11 miles every day for three years? Pause the process. Work with us to find a solution that doesn't transfer the burden onto us. Keep your promise. Keep our kids close to home. Thank you Chair Hollins and Committee. My name is Jennifer hall and I am a Kenton, Oakley Green and Jefferson alumni here representing my 8th grader Sequoia hall, who attends Oakley Green Middle School and participates in several PIL sports for the Jefferson teams as well as those from Jefferson High School family who are not able to be here today and speak. We feel blindsided by the decision to relocate students to marshall 13 miles away from our house after being told in meetings dating back one year ago that we would be able to stay on campus without any timely communication or dialogue with the affected part parties. Athletics and dance are at the core of Jefferson's identity. With more students opting to go to other high schools, which will cause overcrowding, our enrollment at Jeff will plummet and will obliterate our programs we have tried so hard to uphold. When our enrollment decreases, this will allow you to decrease educator FTEs and would likely cascade us into losing our pride of teaching. This displacement will increase traffic stress and anxiety for the entire Jefferson community, while decreasing study time, quality, sleep and overall mental health. Depending on school buses for transportation has proven unreliable and untimely. We are asking that you please consider alternative locations with us that are less invasive to our children's futures and do not uproot us further from north and northeast Portland. Why can't we inquire more in depth about portables and hybrid options with Kenton and PCC sites? Can we utilize the gym fields and dance Studios sooner than 2027? All of us want to see our children succeed. So please consider your own families when you decide on ours. Thank you.

A: Andre Lawrence. I run youth sports for Jefferson high schools and my big concern right now is those youth students. How is youth sports going to continue? Right now we, we have cross country, football, volleyball right now in the fall, basketball and wrestling in the winter, and track and field in the spring. And our kids that we get, we get it from Tubman Ockley Green fobbing and burning. How are these kids going to get to Marshall to be able to continue to play sports? So that's the scare for me with me running a youth sport. Are we thinking about how are those kids going to be able to continue this phase of playing the sport? So that's a big problem for me of one of them of continuing that. The other thing is that's scary is when we start talking about a three year phase. I coach girls basketball at Jefferson High School as well. So if you're a freshman there, you won't never see the new Jefferson. So in reality, when we start talking about re going if I move to a different school, that's the school I'm going to graduate from. This, this new school is going to be for the kids as seventh graders or envelope. So in reality once I there's no hard problem for a parent. I would just go to Grant because that's where I'm gonna graduate from. I don't have to make a decision to say am I gonna Go back to Jefferson because it's a three year deal, right? And so that's the thing too. So this move is affecting our high school, our current high school kids, and those are kids that's going to affect. When we start talking about it. We keep Talking about the 1909 building and the community and we keep saying community. I wasn't in those meetings, but when we started talking community, we all said we wanted to keep that building because they said, we keep the kids on, you guys change your mind, so we should be able to change ours. So when you guys said, okay, well we can't keep the building so you can't stay in there, okay, well, we choose the most important thing to us now is the kids to be on site. So give us a Lincoln, right? And it's funny how nothing, we can't do this, we can't do that, but with Lincoln we can make everything happen. But at the same time, you say, I know how you feel. Always use an example. When somebody's kid get killed and somebody says, I know how you feel, you don't know how that person feels. So in reality, you guys don't know how I feel. I've been around Jefferson since 1996. You guys don't know how I feel, right? So I'm up here fighting for the community to stay whole, right? Because what happens is once this community breaks up, we break up. That's why we said we got kids, we were way out in Gresham, we got people in Beaverton, Vancouver. We lost our community already. My mom said this and I'm gonna go out on this because it goes back what she said earlier. They're trying to do what they did to us back in the day and bust you guys out because they've been trying to close us forever.

A: And so just like I said, when perception is reality, you guys may not be trying to do that at all. I'm not saying you are, but the perception of it when we're not trying to and communicate with. Because you guys did not do a good job communicating earlier. But I heard that, oh, we made a great thing to communicate the community with the community when we found out they couldn't stay. No, you didn't. You guys came to us when you guys had made a decision about moving to Marshall. It was sneaky meetings and that's not fair to us. For you to come to the board and say we met with the community. No, we didn't. You guys just told us what you guys what decision you guys made. So I'm gonna leave it right there. And all I want to say is we gotta make sure we think about the babies when we start talking about just moving kids from one place all the way 12 miles away.

C: And so well said. So, like, I was kind of debating. Like, I don't like to speak unless. But I did have some data. Like, I teach seniors right now. So, like, our middle college program will die if this happens. Like, you can't compare us to other schools of the attrition. I really like my heart. Like, we didn't know. Like, I got an email that we're going to go to Marshall. So the fact, like, for me, they love to do this. We go off on summer break and then we find out, like, I'm going to Marshall, right? They've been doing this to Jefferson community forever. This is like the final displacement, right? Our building, everything around. I'm not telling anything to anybody that you don't already know, but I. It needs to be said right all around. And I'm from north northeast Portland. Right? So it's all been gentrified. We're like the last holdout Y. So then when we go, you can't talk numbers of like, oh, their numbers went up. Grant numbers. One of Grant was like 2,000. When they moved, they were at 5. I'm like, we will be done. And then who comes back in here? Everybody. It won't be this Jeff. And it's not the building. Like, this is the building, right? I taught Andre, right? I'm teaching his kids. I've got their kids right now. So it can work if you get creative people around the table. I don't like other people making decisions for us. I loved your questions. I was like, that's the first time. I'm like, oh, my gosh. People that are gonna, like, ask. I'm like, yes, you're. And I know. So I was like, oh, I'm heartened. But middle college can work. I teach senior and career. They're getting 15 college credits. So my seniors. So I was like, talking to people. I was. I was off a work trip. In San Diego for us, right? I'm like, why don't we just. Our kids. My seniors take 15 college credits. They're taking calculus. They're taking their science classes for age. For their science already over at pcc. And when I go over there with them, they're taking PCC classes. The juniors are taking a college class. Their English class is college over their Joe Credit. So then all of a sudden, they start taking more PCC classes. And we're getting. So we're not talking about putting our whole population there. Let's get them there with me there and their math teachers there. And then all of a sudden, PCC in their future. Because I know they made an offer and it was too. I know there was an offer made, and somebody said, no, okay, so we need to go back to the table. And then maybe Kenton, maybe our junior, our freshman sophomores are Kenton. Or maybe there's a few portables now. Maybe we can afford a few portables, but we need to rethink because I am a creative teacher. I problem solve all day long for what students need. You need something else.

I have a girl that went to American University for three years because she had 15 Portland state credits and she had taken PCC classes. We have kids going to college. We have kids going to trades, right? That is what we want. And we have fostered this relationship. When they tried to close our doors, the beginning, they tried to close us down. And Carol Smith said, we're gonna leave you alone. She was the first person to say, we're gonna leave you alone, do what you're gonna do. And that's when our graduation rate went up. Talked to Margaret Calvert, principal of the year. That was a community effort. That was us saying, we're gonna do this right? And you guys so right.

E: Say your name slowly. Georgie. G E O R G I E. Abraham Honl. I'm reaching out to express my frustration with the latest announcement for the Jefferson modernization. Yet again, our community has been misled about another step in the plan. The latest decision, without real informed discussion, was said to have been decided. The plan to move our students and staff to Marshall for the modernization has been taken off the table as an option, and our community was repeatedly told that the students would not be moved. Now we're being told there are no other options. This is not acceptable. This community does not need another challenge to have to face. In the wake of COVID racial injustice, uprising, and the constant history of inequity, Jefferson High School has had to endure. We're a strong and unique community that has amazing gifts within these walls. Our community has been underserved throughout the district for years. And despite that we have fought our demo pride again and again to move our students and staff to Marshall for the modernization will have unacceptable impacts. This will negatively affect our attendance, our enrollment, our students abilities to engage in sports and other school activities. Our PCC program will be negatively impacted as well. The program, that program is a big draw for our students and our families. Our parents and caregivers will be impacted financially. There will be a huge, huge emotional impacts for both students and families. The previous meeting which people got notification with one day again a pattern of behavior put out by the district was met with opposition to the idea of moving Jefferson High School. Since then we have been hearing more confusion and frustration from our community about this decision in the way this meeting was run and handled by the panel. My mother was a graduate from JHS in 1962. My husband in 1988. Born and raised in North Portland. My son graduated in 2018, my daughter in 2020. I have been a dedicated volunteer with PPS in North Portland for years. I have involved and or on the JHS board PTSA Board for the past 10 years. I have stayed on with the PTSA even as my children have moved on. I have a son to go to JHS in two years. He has been a dedicated volunteer at Jefferson as I have over these years. He will be crushed if he does not get to attend jhs. We will not be able to commute out to Marshall. He is an athlete, artist, musician, very smart and looking forward to the PCC program. Both my older kids took full advantage of that wonderful program. We will not be able to attend and participate if he is to go out there. It is just not financially feasible for our family. That is the conversation for many of our families. One that is not unknown, just ignored. When people are not impacted. Making decisions based on business instead of considering all the factors involved, especially the human factor. I along with others are asking that the district put this decision on pause to consider other options and the community voices that are in opposition of this negatively impacting decision to move JHS to the Marshall campus. One more effect of this pattern of behavior with the district and the JHS community is the matter of trust. It has been broken time and time again. This is yet another example of how and why people are unable to believe in what is being said. The impact of losing more trust will be huge. How you choose to handle this modernization with JHS community is an absolute golden opportunity to put into action the commitments you made to our underserved students and family, especially those students and families of color. Jefferson is the Poorest.

So seems like when you guys let me go, it seems like, you know, one of the reasons why the community agreed to keep the maximum mind building because they thought the kid was going to be able to stay. Is that accurate?

A: Pause of the project. I've heard that come up. Have you heard that come up during the other media, Jeff, what would that do for the project? If we pause the project? So the community that, you know, we talk about, we hear from all the time to come up with some solutions.

start time: 1732:11:40.000
end time: 1738:32:50.000
confidence: 0.81
D: As we mentioned earlier, the schedule is very aggressive. So if we pause the project, it wouldn't like the project at least a year, which tied. That's a dollars component as well. So increase the costs as well, which then would require additional funds or reduction of scope.

end time: 1764:13:24.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I guess my only thought would be if the conversation came back around to a pause out and you know, for whatever the reason, if we're saying pause, I, I would want to make sure because it's going to cost money that that that pause actually includes like is we're very intentional about the level of dialogue that we want and that we're not. And I don't, I think I just, I like to say stuff so that it could be said that we're not having a pause so that we can just go through some steps so that we can say I heard the spoke and then this is what we're going to do, but that we may actually have to bring the architects back out. We may have to do some redesigning, we may have to do some replanning, we may have to look at some new level of zoning based on the input that we're getting from different ones. And the building could actually look completely different from what it looks right now. And all of that's going to cost money. All that's going to cost time. But I think the only way to effectively go into to a real pause is to go into it with that, that level of critical thinking that the entire plan that we have, we could be scrappy because we're, we're trying to do. And that's just like I said, I, I'm sure that that's something that doesn't need to be said, but you know, I'm in a habit of just saying stuff that reinforces what we've already thought and what we're thinking.

D: Final thoughts. Yeah, I mean, I want to elevate the voices of the teachers and coaches that work there because they're the ones that know their community the best. I think if they raise these issues, it's a real issue. I just want to say, like, I mean, I personally would like to explore more creative options, more options to find more money if we need it.

We don't have the ability to say pause. Give us $100 million. We have, you know, we can just ask for $3 million tomorrow. We'll get it. So we have to try and make our school schedule and budget work fair enough. So.

Yeah, I mean, I understand where you're at, but you know, I guess it's for me is when we, we tell the community stuff and we, and we kind of put our name on that, how do we do the best that we can to make sure that the promise that we said stays true? And I understand that, you know, this inflated estimate that came back, which, that's a whole other issue. But so how can we, if we can. Is there any other ways to keep the promise that we said?

start time: 1808:28:40.000
end time: 1851:18:00.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Yeah, I don't think there's a short answer to that question. And it's all going to be trade offs right if we, if there's a pause of the project that delays the project, that delays the completion, it also potentially puts the entire project at risk. If there's for example, if there is a desire, okay, let's go ask for additional funds that additional funds needs to come from. The likely funding source would be a general obligation bond which therefore that is risk that potentially wouldn't be authorized, therefore the project would stop entirely. So there's just, there's a bunch of different trade offs and risks. And I'll just throw this a little bit for process wise. When we got the first cost estimate that we got from the contractor, we realized that we need to do something to try and get the cost back into. But Jefferson's already the largest high school and most expensive one that and so that's you know, and maintain the scope and schedule. And so that, that week long effort that went through, we actually, and just like a visual, it's dozens and dozens of designers around the table. It is the architects as engineers, as civil engineers, as cost estimators. And we brought in community members who've been part of the comprehensive planning process because that process starts with what are the values of the project and what. And so when we have to make decisions, what is it? How, what values do we compare those to? And admittedly that's, you know, that's a week long project. It's not, it's all day and it's not every community. That is the way to help look at retaining the 1909, the existing plan that we had in place. How could we get creative to do that? What are just other completely different options such as building on the track or building on the south side and what are all of those different impacts? Schedule, budget, community values. And comparing all of those and through that process collectively, this four dozen group of people like this is the clearly most viable option as far as the end up build. What does that hundred year product look like? But that requires students to go off site. So then there's a second piece.

A: Hold on, let me summarize what you're saying. So yes, we've done everything we can to make sure that we try to stay true to our promise. And unfortunately, because of the scope and the additional cost, the money we don't have, this is the best option for Jeff.

A: You know, I know, you know, for our community, you know, when we look at how things have been done to us, not with us, I understand this because I think this process was a lot different than processes in the past when there was no community engagement, there was no meetings, there was no inclusion of folks in the thing. Whether you came to the meetings or not, I was there at some of them. I think this process was different. And I know it's unfortunate that, you know, one of the things that we promised we ain't going to be able to keep, I do believe, strong, especially behind our team, that the outcome of what we end up getting will be worth it. And I still think there still could be some through talks and conversations about if we can partial do this partial move thing as well. It just, it's just, you know, it's just one of those things that, you know, as a district, and we apologize, right? This is something that we thought we was going to be able to do as far as keeping our kids on campus and it just doesn't look like it's going to be feasible to do that. And so from the bottom of my heart and from our district, you know, we apologize for that because that was never the intention. You know, I understand the outcome of this is a lot. How it feels and how it hurts. You know, my family was one of those ones who every time they talk about closing Jeff, we had meetings with the principal on the field and all that stuff, I remember going, I remember my family going through all that stuff. So I understand the hurt, I understand, you know, the historical trust issues with pps. But I do, I will say that I think this was done differently and I think the intention was really to make sure that we gave Jeff better than what any other school has.

But when we're saying off site and you're displacing us to deep southeast, that might not even be safe for our students and like athlete all this, like, be more creative. Talk to pcc.
