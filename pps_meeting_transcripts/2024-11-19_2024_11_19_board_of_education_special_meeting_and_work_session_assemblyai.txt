So it's to manage the contract to pay for paid leave Oregon, right? That's correct. And that's been mandated to us without giving us money for it. So just so you know.

As is our practice, board members made a request to pull items off the consent agenda for individual consideration. We had a request from Director Ben Edwards to pull the amendment for ANC School of Business Consulting for a separate vote. Director Ben Edwards, 4. We asked you to share your reasons for deploying this contract. I would like to get this resolution on the table. Do I have a motion. And second.

start time: 102:29:34.000
end time: 136:49:00.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So there happened to be a couple outside contracts contracts on tonight's consent agenda. And outside contracts have been a subject of a variety of reviews and also audit recommendations over the last since 2017, including a recommendation that we benchmark against other districts. Do you think Director Hollins or maybe Director De Hess was on the board when we had that recommendation that we did not do that. And knowing that we're heading into another potential cut cycle, I'm going to be looking at the contracts that are on the agenda and this specific contract. I think it's great that the super agenda has hired a new cfo. Very exciting. And I wanted to make sure that as we are approving tonight and outside an extension of outside contract and that last year we paid about $186,000 to that. We understand how this coordinates with the other with the hiring of a new CFO and that there is so currently this contract and some other. Another contract that's not on Tonight provide backup financial services and budget services. And just understanding how ultimately we re land on a not utilizing so many outside services. So I don't know if Superintendent Armstrong, you want to.

start time: 137:04:50.000
end time: 154:05:10.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Yeah, absolutely. I appreciate the question. I think, as you all probably know, since 2021, there's been a couple of vacancies in different roles over, I guess, for the last three to four years. And so we are excited that we will have our CFO starting in January. But as I mentioned, there's been a couple of vacancies. So two of the three leadership roles in the financial department have been vacant. And so we want our new CFO to be able to hire their own team and be a part of the process as much as possible. And so our new CFO is leaning in. And so I anticipate while there are some transition hours, it's probably going to take a couple of months to get those positions filled. And that transition support that we anticipate being phased out as we get to the month of April.

start time: 154:42:10.000
end time: 155:05:46.000
confidence: 1.00
C: Are you finished?

start time: 155:08:58.000
end time: 155:20:42.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Go ahead.

start time: 155:22:26.000
end time: 167:45:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah. I just also want to say I had some similar concerns as director from Edwards, and I'm always concerned as a district that we spend our money conservatively and, you know, appropriately to give taxpayers, you know, their value. However, I believe that contract is necessary in this case for the same reasons you mentioned. And that's we've got someone new coming that'll start January 6th. I can't remember her last name. Michelle. I'm really excited about that. And she'll have to in short order. I hope not call the authorities if I do forget it. But in short order, she'll need to not only hire a team, but also start the budget process with us in a really challenging budget season.

start time: 168:12:50.000
end time: 187:56:20.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And then this contract will taper down eventually when the new CFO has a new team. The date of this contract is April 20th, end of April. So I'm assuming if it extended beyond that, that you'd be coming back to the board. So the taper down will happen by the 30th. And then the other question, the information that we got right before the board meeting, and I appreciate staff providing it, was sort of the current responsibilities, but they're current as if, I think, up until the arrival of the new cfo. And I would appreciate understanding when the new CFO goes during the transition period, how things are being handled. So what responsibilities the outside vendors, services they're providing and then what the new CFO are providing, just because what we have is what's current with the contractors versus an in house capability.

start time: 188:19:20.000
end time: 214:24:00.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah, absolutely. And I think we're definitely thinking thoughtfully about, I think if we think of the transition of January 6th and where we'll be at with the legislative session as well as our own, communicating out to the public and collecting feedback and analyzing, being able to be prepared to present something to you all by early spring, that all of those are big bucket items of work that's going on right now. So as you can imagine, a new CFO stepping into that who is more than capable, experienced and will do a wonderful job. We also want to make sure that her onboarding experience and transition into Portland is one that allows her time to be immersed in the work that is currently happening while also planning for the new fiscal year. So I just want to acknowledge and lift up that over those first couple of months of her starting, we'll still have the presence of my young and A and B business consulting. And then as I mentioned before, it'll be a phase out. And I will say that we're all still doing all of this with keeping cost neutral. So it isn't a significant increase because of the vacancies. We're able to provide the support that we need to keep the work going while not driving up costs.

start time: 214:29:40.000
end time: 221:09:16.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And then just for the record, the primary point of contact for the financial audit. So the board has ultimately the auditing responsibilities, but there's a staff responsibility. The two leads, one for the bond and the other for the financial audit will be staff leads anyway.

start time: 221:11:08.000
end time: 223:49:20.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Yes, Miyoung as our current CFO will be the point person and then that will transition to a new CFO when she arrives.

start time: 223:57:40.000
end time: 225:12:28.000
confidence: 0.81
B: And then the bond is Danielle.

start time: 225:15:24.000
end time: 233:43:00.000
confidence: 0.96
F: You know, I think that is a great question and it's at this point I know that he serves as a liaison. I think our goal and our hope is that all financial matters are under the, of course, ultimately responsibility of me with the CFO as the liaison or point of contact. But for now we have a multi staff strategy until we're able to fully staff the finance office.

start time: 233:57:20.000
end time: 234:26:54.000
confidence: 0.86

C: Thank you. I'm really, I'm confident, I'm happy that the position is filled and confident you've thought about all of the pieces, moving pieces that are going into this and I feel confident in the coverage and also that you're setting the new CFO for success by this contract as well. So giving the supports needed. Someone's in a new job in a new district. So thank you.

confidence: 0.91
B: Ensure that we're effectively using taxpayers resources. And on its face, this particular contract, since it's somebody moving from what may be perceived as an inside outside role. So somebody contracted general counsel moving out at a similar contract amount. And so I had a conversation with General Counsel Tancre to just understand whether this was a sort of net budget add or how it would again in a year in which we have declining resources or be significantly constrained. The question is, is this a net add more a net neutral and utilizing what I consider like considerable expertise that the current person with the contract currently has with the district.

start time: 291:09:10.000
end time: 293:07:00.000

confidence: 0.93
B: So in 2017. In 2017, we had very, very large legal bills followed by another huge set of legal bills. In 2018, it was also the topic of the Secretary of State, a focus area, the Secretary of State's audit, and specifically Miller Nash that PBS had come to rely on disproportionately. So there hadn't been a disbursement across a number of law firms. So we were very heavily invested in one firm without a lot of cost control and not really taking advantage of sort of the diversity of legal services that are available in our community and also not necessarily getting some of the best bang for our buck because firms aren't having to compete. We just essentially were using Miller Nash, and again, the Secretary of State's audit suggested we do some benchmarking against this and other core services. That didn't happen. I will say the last. Since 2018, there has been a very deliberate diversification of our legal services across. Across a number of law firms, really tapping into the expertise and also really getting some very competitive pricing. I was concerned that some last time, I'll probably potentially vote on a Miller Nash contract, but we're back up to 800,000, which is a pretty significant amount of money for one law firm. So I'm just flagging it in the hopes that we continue the work that had happened, because this. They have a lot of expertise that we need, and they're great partners for the district, and we shouldn't be disproportionately utilizing one firm. So I'm just concerned about the amount of the services, and I want to provide that.

start time: 365:47:30.000
end time: 376:27:00.000
confidence: 0.94
F: We. We did have an opportunity to talk about it, and I understand the concern and the importance of the diversification of law firms. I think there were Some things in this past year that make it slightly unique about why the amount is what it is and isn't reflective of an intentional trend to undiversify or whatever the proper word would be right there. Or concentrate is probably the more articulate way to say that. So I want to acknowledge the conversations you and I have had. And I certainly it's not. It's Dr. Armstrong's accountability, but I'm fairly sure it's my accountability through her. And I hear that. And that diversification is certainly, certainly something I hear from the board.

E: Thanks. Just a couple general comments, and some of this is knowing I may not have a whole lot more time to comment on things like this, but just because you brought it up, Director for my Woods, I continue to think that Secretary of State's audit is one of the worst audits I've ever seen. In my experience with government auditing. And many, many of the findings seemed very intentionally like going out to find a problem and not necessarily using sort of facts or basis. And I thought the recommendations were also flawed in a number of ways. And I've said that before, but I'm going to just put it on the record again. And I think this is a great example of one that by all means, diversifying our legal services makes a lot of sense, but the idea of doing that just to do it is actually pretty flawed. And we as a district should be getting the best legal services from the folks who have the most expertise in the areas we need them. If we can find that from four or five different firms, that's amazing. If we can find it in one firm, the best use of taxpayer dollars is to actually hire that firm to do it. And again, I trust the superintendent and general counsel to make those decisions. Decisions. That's one point. The second point I want to make, which is less about the legal services and maybe it's just more about the first contract. And again, I don't want to dispute looking at these contracts. You know, diving in, making sure asking the questions is a very appropriate role for the board. I do want to stress that we all passed a budget this last time around that had really dramatic cuts to administrative services. I said at the time, and I voted for the budget, but I said at the time, I don't think those cuts were based on analysis or I don't think those cuts were based on sound judgment. I think they were political. And it should not surprise any of us on the board that the budget that we passed that the district in order to effectively run is going to need to engage some outside contractors and outside consultants in order to fill some of the holes that we left by cutting so deeply on administration because in order to run a district effectively, in order to educate our kids effectively, we need those core services. So, so again, no issues at all with sort of asking the questions going through it, but I also hope the superintendent and her team are willing to sort of speak up and say yeah, no, we need to be spending this dollars outside because we no longer have the staff inside on payroll, on our payroll in order to do a lot of the work that just needs to be done.

C: General comment also, and that's that I'm generally in favor of diversifying our contractor article contracts, particularly to give opportunity to women owned minority owned businesses in our community. As a public agency, I think it looks good for us to seek competitive bids. I'm not questioning this particular contract, but I think just in general if we can spend our money in the community or in women owned and minority owned communities, it benefits those communities. And I would be in favor of doing a little bit more cost chopping.

B: Which I'm glad you, I'm glad you raised that up because I wasn't going to comment on that as a benefit. But we did because we competitively asked, we asked law firms to give us their best price. So not only did we get more diverse expertise, we got better prices. And to your point, the ad director to pass, we actually have several women owned firms that we now do business with that we didn't when it was just one firm. And again this is, I want to just put the fact that Monash provides really important services and has some outstanding expertise, lots of expertise with pps, but we did get I think better prices, more diverse expertise and also more diverse firms by doing that. And I will note that for what it's worth, I had my issues with the Secretary of State's audit but I will say also the district agreed with this recommendation and then just didn't do it and follow through on the findings. And then I guess the piece on the cuts to administrative services is my understanding the reason the backfill of these positions is not the contracts for the financial work is not because administrative positions were cut. It was that positions weren't filled. So we didn't have a budget director, we didn't have a cfo. But it wasn't that positions were cut and were filling in the contracted positions. I firmly believe that our best work is done when we have in house expertise and that can be supplemented by contractors when needed. But it wasn't like we cut those positions and then are now contracting them out. And the purpose of my questions tonight is questions tonight on the ANC school business contract was if we have somebody new coming in that should be filling those roles to understand how the taper down and from a budgetary perspective we're going to have that transition in a cost effective way. But not to say that we don't need an in house budget director or cfo because we absolutely do need that.

A: Thank you. Any other further Board discussion? All right, the Board will now vote on Resolution 7006. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes yes. All opposed, please indicate by saying no. Student Director Konsevi, please indicate your vote. Yes. Any abstentions? Resolution 7006 is approved by a vote of 7 to 0 with student director Conseibi voting yes. Next up we have the discussion about the process for filling the upcoming Zone 1 board vacancy. So if you remember, at November 6th board meeting, Director Scott informed us that he will be stepping down from the Board in January. Our Board policy requires that in the event of a board vacancy, the position shall be filled by a majority vote of the remaining board members. I think we have a presentation that is loading. I'll keep moving as the slides are being uploaded. According to ORS 332.018, board members so designated shall meet the eligibility requirements that law and reside in the zone in which the vacancy occurs. So in this case it's zone one. The board shall advertise for a 20 day period in an attempt to find an eligible resident from the same zone to fill the vacancy. And if no eligible zone residents declares interest in the vacant position, the board shall appoint an eligible resident from the district at large. The board member appointed shall serve until June 30 following the next regular district election, at which time his or her successor or they shall be elected to fill the remainder, if any, of the unexpired term. The person who is appointed will be eligible to run for the position in the May special election. Tonight I want to talk through the process and timeline for filling the vacancy. So just kind of be clear. We can discuss the process, create the process, but the vote can't happen until the position is vacant. But we can complete most of the process ahead of time before that vote. So in order to one of the things that we need to decide on the board and as you can see on the slide, directed Vice Chair to pass and I and our Board Manager and legal helped work on a timeline, a proposed timeline of how this is going to work. Now, I just want to just kind of clarify. Director Scott, you are. I think I just want to be clear. Right. Is allowed to work on the. And be involved in this whole process until it's time to vote. At which time the vote can't happen until Director Scott resigns. Yeah.

E: And I'll just say, I mean, I appreciate that but I won't have a vote on my replacement and I'm unlikely to have a whole lot of it put on the timeline.

start time: 526:42:12.000
end time: 581:09:35.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Absolutely. I just want to be very clear that you are welcome through this whole process until the end. Until the end. So the proposed timeline. And as you can see, I kind of highlighted there's things that we need to decide as a board. In effect, actually all of this is up for board decision. But this is what we have so far today as part of the policy requires us to advertise for the position. So that means announce it at the board meeting. But also we need to put some kind of advertisement out there somewhere. So that's why the official start isn't until November 22nd from a 20 day requirement. So today we're announcing the process is starting right now and we're going to advertise in The Oregonian on November 22. Today. Our goal is to review and discuss the application questions. Those were emailed to the board members earlier and I think they are uploaded in board books as well. And the process that we kind of decided on and hopefully I can simply explain this. We would like a application to have about 10 questions. There's a little bit more than 10. And if board members have any additional questions they would like to put up for us to consider, you're welcome to add that now or email it to Ms. Powell afterwards. We would like everyone to rank the questions using a star voting system, which means that each board member gets. And this includes you, Student director Kunsaibi. Each board member has 20 stars where you can distribute to which questions you feel are the most important and which ones you care nothing about. You have 20 stars to put wherever you like. If you've been a student in the last 10 years, you probably know how this works, usually using stickers, but we'll use it virtually. And this is due to RoseAnne Powell on November 21st. The reason for this is because we need time to kind of have the application ready to post online. The other the next thing that we also need to decide is a due date for the application on this timeline that I have today, one of the suggestions we put on is December 13. The reason is because it has to be at least 20 days after the advertised date, which means it has to be after December 12th. We will be posting the application online on the 25th. That just gives enough time for staff to kind of compile the list and post it. If you go on to the next page. Oh, you already did, great. December 13th is the proposed application deadline. And this is where it kind of. We have to. Again, we don't have to make every decision today because it depends on how things happen. So on December 17, we have a board meeting on December 17. This is where we can review our applications. And then I put TBD on there because depending on how many number of applicants, we may need further action or selection process. Like, for example, if we only have three, then we're kind of done with our finalists.

end time: 612:13:20.000
confidence: 0.96
A: But if we have 28, we need to figure out design a process to whittle that down. January 7th is the day that we need to decide on our interview questions. And this is kind of where things kind of move around. I know, Director Scott, you mentioned that you wanted to see the bond referral through completion. So we're hoping that would be done in January, but things may move around. But the idea is that on January 21, during our special session that's already scheduled, we would complete the interview and that would be the day that we vote on our finalists. A couple things I do want to stress is everyone listening, board members, specifically, when looking at other districts and other boards that have done gone through this process, there are some things that have. And again, I think you got an email from legal about this as well, that have gotten in trouble, and we would like to avoid that. So one of the things is that through this whole process, all discussions must happen in a public meeting. Where other boards have gotten in trouble is when board members talk to other people, not in a public meeting about. About candidates. Now, the candidates are welcome to contact you. You're welcome to talk to them. However, if I decide to call Director Brim Edwards on some random Saturday and start gossiping about candidate, that would may lead to some trouble. So that's a big no. No. That also makes it so that the difficulty here. No, it's a good thing because it creates transparency around the whole process. But the thing is that all discussions have to happen in a public meeting. Am I missing anything? Kind of get the gist pretty well. Okay.

C: I just. I'd like to add that in addition to The Oregonian. We're also going to advertise in your zone, in zone one, through the, through the school buildings. So casting a wide net. Pardon me.

B: So, question. So if some. I've already had a couple of calls. I'm sure you all have. So if somebody wants to meet individually to talk to us, that's okay, as long as we're not talking to a board member.

start time: 622:31:26.000

start time: 623:59:20.000
end time: 638:26:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I think that begs a question, though, because I've had conversations with several people that are interested also and wanting to keep it transparent. I know in some workplaces there's a restriction on once a position is advertised, meeting with staff because it's a cultural practice that goes back to golfing with colleagues in order to learn more about the position and having a little bit more exposure to the culture of an organization. So I just, I don't know how we would handle that, but I just want to bring that forth. Some people might be emboldened or feel more comfortable reaching out to elected leaders than others that may be interested. So it's just perhaps a caution. I would just ask. I would say women and people of color may not be as emboldened, you know, to, to do that reaching out.

start time: 639:14:30.000
end time: 666:51:22.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I have a question and a concern about just the timeline because statutorily it Sundays at least 20 days, right? So we have this big build up to the 17th and then, you know, potentially nothing for more than a month. And I don't know why, if it's going to go to January, why we wouldn't wait till January, close the application process then, versus doing a quick process, have it open and then just having it sit there for, you know, potentially a longer period. A longer period of time just seems all your cautions aside, I will tell you there potentially will be serial meetings with board members don't even know about candidates. I mean, it's already happening. Candidates having their friends call board members and then reporting back, like here's what I think they said. And to me it seems like that's just a long period of time to have the process open versus having just a tighter compression. And this isn't putting any pressure on Dr. Scott, but just we know it, we know it's not going to happen until mid January. So why close it and do all that and then just have all this pressure happening? I think a lot of behind the.

end time: 686:38:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Well, it's interesting. It's a longer period of Time. So like the application will still be open. I mean, I'll just say I just went through this process twice in the last month with appointing legislative replacements and it seems like the tighter the process just better so it doesn't hang out there. Also, you know, I think the issue of if the application process is closed and you've met with one candidate does from an ethics standpoint, do board members need to then meet with everybody who's applied versus like hey, the application process is still open. If you want to meet with people you can. But to me having a large long time period afterwards just doesn't make any sense.

start time: 686:53:30.000
end time: 711:05:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Right. So I feel like we have kind of you brought up kind of two issues. So one I'm glad that you pointed out because that's the reason this is a proposed timeline. So how about we pick a suggestion for date that the application closes, maybe even like January 7th. And the second issue is that you're raising is also what kind of expectations for behavior in terms of contacting candidates. Should we vocalize or. I mean we can't obviously make rules that govern other board members behaviors, but at least we can have some kind of expectations about what to do in the interim. Because yeah, it is a long process and that was one of the reasons why for example, one of the things that we wanted to kind of tighten things up to kind of address the same issues that you brought up was having the interview and the vote occur within 48 hours of each other. Right. And that was part of the. Exactly for the reasons that you brought up. Now if you, if. And you raised a perfectly good reason, like if we have such a long period between the closing of applications and the interview. Yeah, that could also we had the issues also that the winter break was also, you know, the last two weeks of December, which is why these things seem a little bit spread out. But yeah, if you have another date for suggested to close.

start time: 711:56:40.000
end time: 730:41:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I would suggest after the first, first week back then it's closed. I mean it also because for candidates there's sort of a two, I think a two part sort of question application. But also the vast majority I think of them also are going to be contemplating like holding about which is a whole other bigger thing. I mean it's actually bigger almost than a six month tour of duty like you're signing up for a campaign and potentially four years. And to me just having more time period for people to have that and then having it be tight. The other recommendation I would have is like I think you could actually do the interview and the voting all at the same time. I mean, in the same meeting, we will have had the application. We would have had the interview. So it seems like that would, instead of having it be like one meeting after another, but just like one. Just one meeting.

start time: 731:28:00.000
end time: 735:31:00.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So. Right. So would closing the application on January 7th sound good? Is there any issues to closing the application on January 7th instead?

start time: 735:33:40.000
end time: 738:54:00.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So that would be closed and reviewing. We would all review them on January 7, right? That's when we'd review the application.

start time: 739:13:00.000
end time: 739:51:06.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Yeah. So I was going to say, wouldn't.

start time: 739:51:38.000
end time: 749:26:40.000
confidence: 0.97
C: They need to be. If we close on the 7th, then we would have a really short window. We don't know how many applications we're going to receive, so that's part of it. But would we. If we close the application, are we reviewing them on a rolling basis? I guess that's on a rolling basis. So the seventh. We don't. I don't have a meeting on the seventh. I don't have it, but I think we do have a meeting.

start time: 749:33:00.000
end time: 754:17:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: We have a regular board meeting on the 7th. We are also, you know, the. We could also ask for a special session too, if we. If needed. But the seventh would give two weeks before the final vote on 21st.

start time: 754:33:10.000
end time: 760:28:10.000
confidence: 0.91
B: I mean, you can do a process by which also. So say there's 10 applicants and it could be like every board member gets three votes, and the candidates for the top three votes, those are the finalists that we interview to narrow it.

start time: 762:00:00.000
end time: 765:36:20.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Can I ask just a quick process question? When the board votes on the replacement, does that take place immediately? So, for instance, if they were to vote at the beginning of the meeting on the 21st, would the board member be able to be seated on the 21st?

start time: 765:52:00.000
end time: 766:07:20.000

B: That is a good question.

start time: 766:08:00.000
end time: 768:17:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: I don't think it happens at that meeting, but it happens kind of immediately after, whether it's the 21st or the 22nd. As long as there's a vacancy, it happens right after.

start time: 769:03:46.000

F: And so I will confirm that exact process.

start time: 769:42:18.000
end time: 781:09:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: I'll just, I'll raise for the board. I, you know, again, your, Your decision in terms of how you run the process, I think it would be great to not have zone one unrepresented for any period of time, if that's possible. I have, as I think you all know, left the data a little bit fuzzy. My hope is that we refer the bond on January 7, which is the current schedule, in which case my last day would be January 10, the end of that week. So to extend the board again, all up to you could design a process that allows a board member to be seated in order for the next vote. I think that would be ideal.

start time: 781:42:50.000
end time: 782:43:50.000
confidence: 0.98
A: So are you suggesting perhaps like, a special session on the 14th?

start time: 783:00:30.000
end time: 783:58:10.000

start time: 784:04:30.000
end time: 791:14:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So say we've referred the bond on the 7th, the applications are due. Say you make it the 6th, which is the first day back, but people have had two months. We pick our finalists the week of the 6th and on the 14th. You.

start time: 792:27:20.000
end time: 802:05:44.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Like that? The concern I have is, what if, again, like, planning for extremes. Right. What if we get 30 applicants? Like, 30 applicants. So that means between the 7th and the 14th, we have to figure out how to whittle down 30 down to 35 or 3 to 5. Right. I'm a little bit inclined to ask for, you know, like, last day of school before winter break as, like, happy holidays. Here's your 30 applicants to read through on the 20th. But I'm okay either way.

start time: 802:07:12.000
end time: 804:16:30.000
confidence: 0.84
B: We don't have to have a b. A date that we're meeting at, like, the last day that you and.

start time: 805:38:34.000
end time: 810:05:38.000
confidence: 0.91
B: So the other thing on the application, I would really suggest that we have, like, a character limit. I mean, just in terms of the 30 applicants also. And, you know, something that's reasonable, not like you get 50 characters to say why you're, you know, supporting the public.

start time: 810:06:34.000
end time: 816:11:10.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I would definitely agree with the character limit. And because I'm also of the thought of, you know. You know, my grandmother would say, y'all have heard me say it before. If was a fifth, we'd all be drunk. But what if we only get one? So, you know, if we're. When we get in the land of the land. In the world of hypothetical, this is.

start time: 816:11:50.000
end time: 816:16:46.000

start time: 816:17:18.000
end time: 828:54:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: It's just that hypothetical. I am with the idea. I do like the idea of having the character limit. So that would be good. That way we can, you know, know exactly how much we're reading. I'm with Andrew. And that I do like the idea of our zones being covered and never going without even, even remotely a day where there's no one covering or no one responsible, you know what I mean, for that. For that district. So I do like that idea that whenever it happens, it should be a seamless transition. I would even be okay with there being, like, a handoff of some kind. But, yeah, I want to throw that out there too.

start time: 829:20:30.000
end time: 833:26:10.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Well, Andrew, you could. If we did the referred the bond, you wouldn't have to retire exactly. The day after that. Right. You could hang on until we got to be answering those constituents emails up and down.

start time: 834:54:00.000
end time: 843:29:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So we got three questions to decide on. Number one, character limit. I don't know, it's been a while since I counted characters. Should we just say 10 pages max, 1.5 spacing, 12 point font minimum. And then we have. Second decision is do we want to have a special meeting on the 10th? Which would minimize the amount of days that someone isn't represented. And then the third question is the due date for the application.

B: Because the last day of winter break is January. So I think the range of possibilities would be for example, December 20, which is. So when things start shutting down, like year end, December 31, which is a nice break, or January 6, which is the first day back after the school break. Seems like the 20th makes sense. For one thing, we know how many there were then. If we do have 30, we could have a different plan. Besides, I would think people would be happy to get it done before the holiday and we'd be happy to know before the holiday.

start time: 868:09:04.000
end time: 874:32:22.000
confidence: 0.96
A: The concern. Yeah, I mean I'm for January 20th as well. The concern I have is that, you know, staff has to put it together and send it to us. Right? I don't know. Should we would like December 20th at noon, would that provide enough time to post it online so that we have access to all of it?

start time: 874:35:26.000
end time: 877:49:42.000
confidence: 0.89
B: The thing is just they'll all be public records. I'm trying to understand what you're asking. So December 20th through the day that.

start time: 877:50:06.000

E: The application opens or closes.

start time: 878:41:20.000
end time: 881:41:04.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Closes. So December 20, let's say like December 20 at noon. Would that be enough time to upload it to whatever uploading system that we have to.

start time: 881:42:32.000
end time: 882:16:32.000

start time: 884:47:20.000
end time: 887:05:10.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Everyone okay with that? Yes. And Director Green and Director Hollins, if you have any no's you want to just let me know.

confidence: 0.93
B: The other question I would push on the application, but I'm also curious, from just like other board members perspective is a point of view on whether we want somebody who fully intends on running. So I would want to know if an applicant, like, I'm interested in the six month appointment, but I'm not going to run. I know we've said they may run for it, but that's different than knowing. I would like to know if somebody's going to run for the position because I think that's important for me, an important fact.

start time: 900:56:50.000
end time: 902:06:34.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Sorry, you're suggesting that would be a question added to the application.

start time: 902:08:42.000
end time: 911:43:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I mean, for me, I'll just say it's a requirement. It would be a requirement. I would have a hard time supporting somebody. Say we get multiple qualified candidates and somebody's like, I'd like the appointment, but I'm not interested in running for the position. I think it's much better for the board if the person we appoint is actually intending to run. It doesn't mean they're going to win. But it's like, we're hiring, we're appointing somebody for a different reason. If it's just like, hey, you're just a placeholder until we get the real person.

start time: 912:02:10.000
end time: 912:23:50.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Yeah, that's a good point.

start time: 912:44:50.000
end time: 913:48:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: People can have different points of view because sometimes you do do like, hey, we want to play solder.

start time: 914:03:50.000
end time: 917:05:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: And I've seen people on the Multnomah County Commission appointed that were intentionally not running, that were, I guess, serving as placeholders or advocates within certain communities.

start time: 917:08:30.000
end time: 918:59:58.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I'm just trying to figure, because it's just appointed by the person, the commissioner.

start time: 919:47:50.000
end time: 921:12:10.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Yeah, yeah. Well, actually you choose the first day you take office. Like, who's gonna take your position?

start time: 921:45:30.000
end time: 926:33:38.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Okay. I'm just trying to think through what benefit that would be, who that would benefit, who would harm, if anybody, and if there's any reason we need to know. I mean, I think it shows some commitment to the position, but other than that.

start time: 926:35:54.000
end time: 931:43:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Also, I think, like, I think it's much better for the district to have somebody who's going to commit longer term. I mean, they barely get onboarded and then like, they'd be off.

start time: 931:55:00.000
end time: 932:24:00.000

end time: 935:19:56.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I mean, I was just putting it out there because I have a strong opinion about it, but other people might have different. There certainly should be a question, I think.

start time: 935:21:08.000
end time: 949:31:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yeah, let's add that to the list. All right. For the sake of just kind of moving along and making time. Your silence is indicating consent. So just so we know, I'm going to go over the calendar and if you object to anything Just say no or if you have changes. So today we're announcing we're going to have the advertising in Oregonian on 22nd, including social media posts, local PTAs, etc. We'll be posting the application on November 25th. The new date for application closing is noon on December 20th, right before winter break. And then we will have a special meeting on the 14th of January Tuesday to interview the candidates and vote.

end time: 955:09:20.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I think. But there would. In between the 7th and the 21st there would be a swearing in. So in other words, at this they wouldn't be seated at the meeting on the 7th.

end time: 957:46:34.000
confidence: 0.96
F: I think the challenge is we don't know the date of Director Scott's resignation and he may. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but he may still be in.

end time: 958:07:22.000

E: You're right. Yeah, I'm. I'm sorry. I plan to be on the seat of the seventh because that's what we're going to refer the bond.

end time: 960:39:10.000

B: Yes.

start time: 961:14:10.000
end time: 964:00:26.000
confidence: 0.85
D: I have a quick question. So what if for some reason the divine don't get referred on the 7th? We got some directors got.

start time: 964:01:38.000
end time: 964:23:10.000

start time: 965:05:20.000
end time: 965:10:32.000

E: No.

start time: 965:10:56.000
end time: 966:27:36.000
confidence: 0.94
D: I'm just saying if something happens to where it don't happen, are you going to stay on it until it gets referred?

start time: 966:29:28.000
end time: 968:03:00.000
confidence: 0.98
E: No, you can't hold me hostage. That's all we got to do.

start time: 968:18:40.000
end time: 970:07:00.000
confidence: 0.92
D: I wasn't trying to tell the game plan already. I'm just saying, you know, it might get pushed out in a little bit.

start time: 970:17:20.000
end time: 977:30:40.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yeah. Honestly, Director Holmes, that, yeah, I'm hoping he gets referred on the seventh have left a little bit of leeway. So like if we don't get there on the 7th, but people are like, oh man, it's just a couple more days and you know, we can refer it and schedule a special session. That's fine. If we're at the seventh and folks are like, oh no, we're not going to be able to refer it for another two, three, four weeks, then you'll probably have a new board member voting on it.

start time: 977:51:40.000
end time: 984:16:52.000
confidence: 0.96
F: I appreciate the conversation and I would say that I hope the hope is that we can get the. I think one of the reasons why Andrew, Director Scott agreed to stay on is so that he can get us to where we need to be by chairing the committee. And so I think the hope of staff is that we are ready to.

start time: 984:17:16.000
end time: 985:25:40.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Refer the bond by January 7th and.

start time: 985:26:20.000
end time: 986:22:12.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Honor his commitment and time on that.

start time: 986:23:56.000
end time: 1003:21:40.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Specific committee that he's leading. One of the things, this is maybe for later in our work plan discussion, but when I look at the work plan, I don't. I think January 7th is very optimistic just in the sense of we haven't settled on any of the major components. Already had a lot of board level discussion about those major components. There have been more process and the figure outline package. And we don't have a draft of the ballot title or the explanatory statement or all the things that we need to do. And we don't have a lot of meetings. Just a concern that I put out there. It's like we need to fill in a lot more detail about what the mechanics are in order to get us to that January 7th.

start time: 1003:36:40.000
end time: 1024:03:18.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So before we get bogged down in that calendar, we can, if it doesn't happen on 7th, we can always, as a board, decide to move the interview and vote later. And so I think I would rather move forward with setting the date. Today is January 14th to honor the wishes of people minimizing the number of days zone one is not represented. And if need be, if it's starting to look late in December, that things are going to be moving on, we can always decide as a board to change the date of the interview and the vote. The things that I think are most important right now is the application and when it closes. And I think it sounds like we have consensus on that. And then let's just bookmark January 14th for the day of the interview and vote. Is there any again, knowing that that can change depending on how the bond process goes. But as of now, is everyone okay with yes, your silence indicates you're not. Not. Wait double.

start time: 1024:04:54.000
end time: 1026:59:50.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I see them nodding and somehow we would have decided on the interview question. That's something we don't have. We can just do that. It'll happen.

start time: 1027:01:50.000
end time: 1035:16:56.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yeah. One of the reasons we, as you see on the proposed timeline, we decide on the interview questions later is because as we get in, the candidates in certain questions might arise that we may come up with that want to ask all the candidates, of course, to be kind of fair to everything. But like for example, certain issues may come up that we notice in a lot of the applications that we want to decide on interview questions. So that's the reason why we held that till later until we can decide, until we see like what candidates that we got. Okay. Yeah.

start time: 1035:17:28.000
end time: 1038:33:04.000
confidence: 0.93
F: And I had three things to share. I would definitely love to see students and like the district student council kind of being involved in, like, the interview process, kind of similar to the superintendent selection process. I found that really helpful, especially now.

start time: 1038:34:32.000
end time: 1039:17:04.000
confidence: 0.88
E: Board members, they represent the students. So I think it would be.

start time: 1039:18:32.000
end time: 1040:13:52.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Makes sense to have the students kind of be involved in that interview process.

start time: 1040:16:56.000
end time: 1042:49:00.000
confidence: 0.97
E: And then the next question I had is, are board members allowed to endorse a certain candidate or, like, publicly show their support or is that.

start time: 1043:03:20.000
end time: 1043:34:20.000
confidence: 0.98
A: That's a good question. I don't know.

start time: 1043:48:50.000
end time: 1050:12:30.000
confidence: 0.98
F: I can't think of a legal reason why not. But it would certainly be concerning to do so before the interview process. And all of it is in full public display. So it's probably not a ban on endorsing, but it would be. I would offer the very strong caution against that, because you need to get to the point of the interviews and then the public discussion.

start time: 1050:32:50.000
end time: 1051:00:10.000
confidence: 0.88
E: And then my next question was just.

start time: 1051:00:50.000
end time: 1051:33:14.000
confidence: 0.89
F: Like, the broader community have a role.

start time: 1051:33:22.000
end time: 1052:18:30.000
confidence: 0.97
E: In, like, the process of selecting the board member.

start time: 1052:56:50.000
end time: 1084:37:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah. I mean, what. What makes us difficult is that as board members, you know, all discussions about candidates, we need to do in a public forum, in a public meeting. And then the other thing is, the other thing that kind of makes it difficult is that, you know, to. To provide an equal experience for everybody makes it very difficult. If people start petitioning board members and board members are meeting with individuals one on one, then every board member kind of has a different experience. Right. And it may. It could do. There's some, like, unintended consequences, as well as, for example, access opportunities that it could, you know, it could be limiting other people. People's access opportunities. So I think that's kind of why this is kind of a difficult process, is because of. That is because, you know, in the effort to try to make this as equal as possible to all people who are interested in wanting to apply, including people who traditionally may not put themselves out there. It makes it difficult for us to kind of just kind of, you know, just have everyone go at it. Right. And so that's kind of why it is this way in terms of. I love your questions about involving the students if they have interview questions. I think one thing that we can, you know, just off the top of my head, just brainstorming, if students have interview questions they would like to be asked, I think they should send that in to us, to the board and to be incorporated into our interview, because I think that that's a great idea. But yeah, so to kind of answer your question, that's kind of why this is challenging, is trying to create a fair process at the same time following ethics laws at the same time. It's such a shortened timeline. Right. So it is hard.

start time: 1084:44:10.000
end time: 1091:59:04.000
confidence: 0.90
B: I mean, I'm just going to say that the other challenge of having this December, I'm not going back on the timelines, but going from December 20th to the 14th is people also are going to be filing for office and they're going to be getting endorsements. And so while they may be, like, applicants of the process, they're also going to be candidates with endorsements, I'm sure in their own races.

start time: 1092:01:12.000
end time: 1096:47:44.000
confidence: 0.93
C: So, I mean, I was going to say, could we. I don't have the deadlines for filing for office for this, for the May. It's end of February, so we should have our process completed well before that filing deadline.

start time: 1096:49:52.000
end time: 1105:56:30.000
confidence: 0.91
B: But already, I mean, already. So January 1st is kind of like when a lot of people just kick off their campaigns. Even if you can't technically still file, it's like the time when you start, you can start, right? You can open a pack. Even if you can't file, you can open a pack. You can get endorsements, you can have a website. So we should just know that, like, once we have applications, and if people are also candidates, like, the applications for soil will be public records. So just on that. And candidates will likely be out getting endorsements and raising money who also may be applicants.

end time: 1116:56:12.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I know Andrew is talking about leaving early because, you know, so people get half time is do we have to have someone there since they have to run in May anyway? Like, can we just not have it or. And then that whoever run and may make. Because I guess I'm looking at the whole question that came up earlier. If we appoint someone now and say they do run and lose. Well, now. Now you switching out a new person all over again. And we only talking about maybe five months.

start time: 1116:59:16.000
end time: 1118:14:00.000
confidence: 0.94

start time: 1120:04:20.000
end time: 1125:44:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yeah, it's a good question. I think we're all. I mean, that that's just kind of the reality of the situation we're in. And I think the interest that was expressed by a couple board members about leaving, not leaving Zone one unrepresented for too long is kind of the reason for the urgency.

start time: 1126:08:50.000
end time: 1130:51:50.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Well, what's considered, I guess one thing is what's considered too long and two, if the person is just getting on board, and we know we have that big learning curve, you know, for that first year, two years, is it really just Having someone in the seat at that point.

end time: 1149:59:30.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Go ahead. I was just saying I think it's super important to have somebody in the seat the whole time. I mean, we have a new superintendent and whoever gets appointed, I think it's really important that not only they participate in all the board activities relating to our. Both annual, the quarterly conversations with the superintendent around our board goals, but just be, you know, help pass the bond, engage in the legislative session. You know, we can use as many leaders as possible and certainly in this. And I know, I know Director Scott's not going anywhere and he'll be an advocate for the bond, but it also would. We absolutely, I think, should have somebody from Southwest on the board while we've got a bond related to their high school. Unless you're signing up to be in a lot of committees.

start time: 1151:07:50.000
end time: 1159:59:00.000
confidence: 0.92
D: I'm just trying to really look at this way. So just try to play it out right, Andrew. Director Scott leaves on the 14th. We get somebody else in possibly by the end of February. You got May, March, April, May, for instance, say if that person don't win, that means they're gonna really only been there three months. They're not really gonna be effective from May to June. So we're really talking about a three, potentially a three month time period.

start time: 1160:59:50.000
end time: 1162:06:10.000
confidence: 0.98

start time: 1171:55:30.000
end time: 1173:50:30.000

C: Yeah, thank you. And OSBA might be helpful in that They've probably done this a million times.

start time: 1174:15:30.000
end time: 1182:51:50.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So the other thing I would suggest is when we have six board members with the potential of a tie is that before we potentially get to a tie that we talk about how we're going to do it. And I'm not suggesting ranked choice, transfer voting, but maybe director will ask us some suggestions, But I just think we should think about that beforehand about so we don't end up in a deadlock.

start time: 1183:34:50.000
end time: 1186:29:22.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I actually did think about that, thought about the six and you know, six people that's even perhaps the star voting would be useful in that situation.

start time: 1186:31:46.000
end time: 1218:30:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah, that's part of the reason we're using star voting in the application question process is we get a little practice in how that works and work out in kinks beforehand. For the sake of kind of moving the conversation along. I would. I just want to make sure that we decide on calendar, and then as. As things come up, we can always revisit and change two things that you have for homework. Every board member here, your homework is to. If there's any additional questions that you want in the application, please send that into Resources Powell as soon as possible. And you, Roseanne Powell, will be sending out a document for all of us to vote on the application questions. You have 20 stars to distribute. Please don't cheat on our system. Number two, this is not just for student Director Kunsebe, but for all of us. But if there's. Obviously, it's hard to brainstorm on the spot, but if there's any additional ways we can incorporate student voice, if we can start brainstorming on that, too, that would be great as well. And then we need to decide. So that's your homework is just the application question. Now, the final decision is that we are now tentatively scheduling a special meeting on January 14th for interview and vote. And in that 30 minutes between that, we finish the interview and we do the final vote. You are welcome to endorse whoever you want. Maybe it might be more, but I'm just saying. Just kidding. So that. So again, moving along, I would like to set January 14th as our tentative special meeting date to interview and vote. Any disagreements with that? Because we do need to finalize the calendar tentatively today.

start time: 1219:08:50.000

start time: 1225:25:00.000
end time: 1227:55:32.000
confidence: 0.98
B: You said after the interviews, then there'd be half an hour in between and we could advocate for somebody.

end time: 1236:10:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So with the interview day or, sorry, the special meeting, we would have our interview, and again, we have to decide on the format. We haven't decided on that yet. The reason for that is because questions may come up as we go through this process, and I want to give time for questions to come up. But we'll have an interview with the finalists on that day, and then there will be time for board discussion. And that's again for the board to decide how long we want to discuss, and then the final Vote.

start time: 1237:25:50.000
end time: 1240:42:24.000
confidence: 0.98
B: It does sound to me like it's a good idea not to meet with people before. If we know them. If people have asked us like that, they want to talk to us.

start time: 1240:43:52.000
end time: 1253:57:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah. I think this is another good discussion point. Like, for example, having equivalent experiences for all the board member. If candidates wanted to petition. So this is a question, right? So if candidates wanted to petition board members, is it possible to have, you know, say, people who are wanting to email board members about, like. Like why this person is great or whatnot? Is it possible to compile it all in. Well, not possible. Is it a good idea to compile all in one location so that all board members have access to all of it? And is that just any. Anybody who wants to send word in about a certain candidate or petition board members? You know, it's just that way that all the board members have access to the same information. Information.

start time: 1254:06:20.000
end time: 1256:33:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I'm just feeling like what I want to do. Well, two people have contacted me is just say, this is the process. That's it. Not standing.

start time: 1256:35:00.000
end time: 1257:02:44.000
confidence: 0.84
A: I think that would be the cleanest.

start time: 1257:04:52.000
end time: 1264:26:40.000
confidence: 0.97
C: And I do too. I feel strongly about that too. And we can't do anything about, you know, anybody that expresses interest, but we absolutely can control how we show up. I've been contacted by four people, so. And a couple I have a relationship with. So it makes it easier, I would just say personally, to have the same access for everyone. That's how. That's how you keep things diverse. And.

start time: 1265:25:00.000
end time: 1275:48:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: How do you do that? If, like, I'm just thinking about, like, when I ran for public office or when, like, Eddie ran and they reached out to the directors and we met with them and had lunch and talk with them about, you know, priorities and all that stuff. How do you. How do you not have that opportunity for someone who's going to be running? Because most likely they're going to be running for the position anyway for the campaign. So how do you, as a board member, say, no, we're not going to speak to you, versus when. Like when I was a board member and I got a whole lot of information and insight on the position by talking to board members.

start time: 1276:13:40.000
end time: 1283:10:10.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah, I wonder if it could be. There's an appointment process, then there's an election process. So I see them as a little bit different. You know, the appointment is an application process. The, you know, campaigning and going through a special election is, you know, maybe that's a more appropriate time to have those conversations because those. Those happen organically during a campaign.

start time: 1283:47:10.000
end time: 1289:16:50.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Here's what I'd say, is that Maybe we just disclose who we've talked to and that just makes it all transparent. I think it would be. I don't know of any board members who ran for the board without talking to a current board member.

start time: 1289:29:50.000
end time: 1290:47:40.000
confidence: 0.89
C: And I'm looking just memories of meeting with you.

start time: 1290:55:20.000
end time: 1303:05:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: So to me, like, it's like, do I want to do that job? Do I want to spend the next four and a half years? Is this like the best way for me to contribute? So like I said, I think the bigger ask is actually somebody actually running. And maybe it's that we have, you know, we give the board office. Here's how we want to be contacted. If somebody's interested in talking to a board member and like, if they choose to avail themselves of that, they can. And we could disclose who we, you know, we can provide disclosure. So that's transparent. But I just don't see somebody making a decision to run without like talking to any current board members.

start time: 1303:38:10.000
end time: 1303:55:06.000
confidence: 0.89
A: That's a reality, right?

start time: 1303:56:18.000
end time: 1304:45:46.000
confidence: 0.93
C: It is. Portland. Everybody knows everybody anyway.

start time: 1304:46:18.000
end time: 1331:55:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: But yeah, I guess the caution that just kind of share with all the board members that if you do decide to do that, right. The issue is like, so this, it's a little different than a general election because in a, in a general election or at large, city at large, you know, it's the people that, the public that votes for the position, not the board members. And in this case, we're the ones who are going to be voting on that position. So then it kind of makes a little different. And one of the, one of the things that we want to actively try to avoid is access advantages. For example, if I met with candidate A and I didn't meet with candidate bnc, I may already be biased towards candidate A, even if BNC might be a stronger candidate. And so in the ideal world, all of us would meet with everybody who is interested equally. And. But the thing is, you know, I doubt we all have the time and energy to be able to do all that, especially if there's going to be like 30 candidates. I'm just saying, right? If there's three candidates, it's just a whole different ball game. So maybe that is possible. So I guess it kind of comes down to how many candidates are we actually going to have? So maybe what I would propose right now is that let's start the application process first, and if it's looking like there's only going to be three, we can reach revisit this and talk about, you know, what are some of the protocols that we would like to, you know, not, not, not like rules on each other, but just like asking each other board members, like, how we should go about approaching these candidates. Because I think it does make a difference if there's three versus if there's 30. And I think it would be important for us to find out that first. Does that kind of make sense?

start time: 1332:06:20.000
end time: 1336:56:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah, but you talk about access, right? You said, you know, if you know, you talk to candidate A, but you don't talk to candidate B or C. I think the difference is that I don't know any of us board members who will not give access to someone who want to talk about this big commitment that they're looking into getting into.

start time: 1337:29:30.000
end time: 1341:25:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yes, yeah, absolutely. Ideally. Right. But what if it. I mean, I'm just saying, you know, life happens, so it, it's hard to kind of take that account. Again, this is just me asking everyone, just use your best judgment.

start time: 1341:47:00.000
end time: 1342:04:40.000

D: Sounds good.

start time: 1342:24:20.000
end time: 1350:55:34.000
confidence: 0.95
A: All right. We have decided on the tentative timeline. Right. So then we can move on again if there's any further questions. Just kind of reminder, discussions about candidates need to happen in, in an open meeting. Discussions about process though. We can discuss that. Can we discuss that individually? Like, for example, if we have an issue with the timeline. Right. That's something that we can talk about.

start time: 1350:58:22.000
end time: 1352:31:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: You can discuss it one on one with each other, but not as a group. The same public meetings apply.

start time: 1352:33:10.000
end time: 1352:48:22.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Okay, thank you.

start time: 1352:50:06.000
end time: 1365:09:30.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I want to make sure included in our timeline is a board level discussion of how we're going to vote. I'm fine for the star system for questions, but I don't think I am for how we're going to vote on the candidate because it potentially could get one board member more weighted stars than somebody else. So that's something that I want to, to discuss and agree upon. Like, we all have one vote, but like how we get from. If there is. How we break a tie if there, if there was one.

start time: 1365:23:50.000
end time: 1369:29:42.000
confidence: 0.94
A: In a star system, there are like, depending on the number of candidates, there are like limits, like rules so that you don't. So one board member doesn't wait. Like, for example, if you have 20 votes and one board member gives one candidate 20 votes, 20 stars, no matter what, how anyone else votes, that person will win.

start time: 1369:30:06.000
end time: 1369:32:22.000
confidence: 0.81
E: Right.

start time: 1369:32:46.000
end time: 1380:04:48.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So there are. When there are certain number of candidates, there are like limits of number of stars that you can give to help to prevent that situation where one board member can decide the outcome, if that makes sense. But yeah, that's something we will discuss. That's on the docket for discussion items. But yeah, I agree with you. Okay. Moving on Next. Next on our agenda is the integrated Program's annual report for 2023, 2024. Superintendent Armstrong, would you please introduce this next item?

start time: 1380:07:44.000
end time: 1390:12:30.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you for that. Well, it's that annual point in time where we give a report that is based on the last academic year, not fiscal current academic year. And so I have our wonderful Director, Federal Programs Interim Senior Director coming forth to bring that report. So I will turn it over to Dr. Jefferson.

E: Good evening, directors, student representative and Dr. Armstrong. My name is Dr. Comedra Jefferson, interim Senior Director of Funded Programs, and I am here to present the annual report for the Integrated Grant Plan covering six ODE initiatives. We are required to present this report to our Board of Education each November.

E: Are planning for the current year and beyond, in this presentation, we are asking you to look back on the 202324 school year. You all have received this presentation and the detailed board memo, so I will be brief with this overview. This evening we will cover the highlights of the integrated grants and guidance investments and a summary of the annual report narrative. In March 2023, the board approved our 2324 application and plan to secure the $115.8 million in state and federal grant funding from ODE for the biennium. These are restricted grant dollars, ODE incorporated into a common framework focused on improving outcomes and learning conditions for students and educators. The detailed plan and additional background are posted on our website. This slide highlights the six initiatives in ODE's Integrated Grant Program with the allocations for the biennium. As you can see, SIA is the largest of all the grants. Grant investments strengthened our efforts to address inequities, foster inclusive partnerships and provide differentiated learning opportunities.

start time: 1425:55:10.000
end time: 1426:31:50.000
confidence: 0.99
B: The plan aligns closely with the PPS.

start time: 1426:33:10.000

confidence: 0.96
E: Strategic Plan, reinforcing our commitment to high quality inclusive education that disrupts racial inequities, targeted investment, supported focal students and school based needs, prioritizing culturally responsive site based learning funding decisions and reflected priorities identified in our annual budget process. The annual report only looks at progress in 23 and 24 and includes a narrative with three main questions which we are required to review with you tonight. The evaluation framework ODE uses is examining the full system, not just progress, but the grant investments. For that reason, our response to the narrative question is largely the same response and information we have shared with you and our community about our OSAS results. The first question is asking about our progress and our outcomes and strategies. As Dr. Armstrong and Dr. Adams have shared, the district has seen three years of steady growth in both ELA and math, with students across Grades three through eight maintaining progress in ELA and showing growth in math. In addition, students with disabilities also showed improvement in academic achievement, as did Black and Latinx students in third grade reading and fifth grade math. When we consider that success against the challenges and barriers ODE has asked in Question two, we recognize that PPS still faces a crisis. We must accelerate learning for focal students, especially Black and Native students, and close persistent gaps. These outcomes do not align with our belief in every student's potential and we need to do better to support their success. However, funding constraints amid a $40 million deficit following $30 million in cuts could significantly impact and constrain our ability to sustain our growth while closing our achievement gaps. The final part of the question also asks what ODE can do to support in regards to these challenges. We are deepening our efforts to learn and improve in order to address critical gaps. We also need state Support in the 2527 biennium. Additional funding would help sustain key initiatives including educator development, literacy programs, MTSS interventions, and well being support for students and families. As part of the annual report, ODE also requires PPS to review progress on our longitudinal performance growth targets. These include attendance, third grade reading, ninth grade on track and fourth grade graduation as well as five year completer rates, PPS reviewed progress towards the LPGTS and part of our progress for reviewing the board goals. The full annual report was included in your board packet and includes the narrative responses and an assurance that the target has been reviewed. The full report along with these slides are also posted on the PPS website. And thank you for your time today. Are there any questions? Thank you.

start time: 1491:21:30.000
end time: 1492:27:50.000

E: These are longitudinal performance growth targets.

start time: 1492:54:50.000
end time: 1493:37:40.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Is that the same thing as local performance assessments?

start time: 1493:40:10.000
end time: 1511:33:50.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Hi Director Hollins. There we go. These are not the same as the local performance assessments. These targets are required of all districts in Oregon and they are around the five common metrics. You know, regular attendance, long time graduation, ninth grade on track. I think it's third grade reading and then fifth grade math. They are different than the board goals. The board goals, as we've mentioned before are more rigorous than these growth targets and we can't readily compare them to the board goals because ODE requires us to create this super focal group that has almost all the different categories of underserved students, including students with disabilities, students experiencing poverty, the racial categories that we consider to be underserved. So it's a compliance effort on our part to maintain these local performance growth targets. But they are not more rigorous than our board goals, which is where we keep our focus as a district.

start time: 1512:14:50.000
end time: 1514:40:18.000
confidence: 0.93
D: And I'm assuming the how we monitor this is in the. I haven't read the whole pac. I mean, I have not went into.

start time: 1514:41:14.000
end time: 1514:51:10.000
confidence: 0.99
E: The.

start time: 1515:47:10.000
end time: 1517:19:30.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Tabs that you guys have, but I'm assuming that's like how we monitor this is in there.

start time: 1518:19:10.000
end time: 1518:58:50.000
confidence: 0.82
E: Oh, in the annual report, yes.

start time: 1519:56:30.000
end time: 1524:14:18.000
confidence: 0.93
C: May I ask a follow up question then? So the supergroup has these larger categories. They're not disaggregated, but we disaggregate locally. So we have an understanding of where each specific group lands.

start time: 1524:15:54.000
end time: 1528:30:30.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Exactly. So we can be more focused. The ideas, if we know specifically that Latinx students aren't performing in this particular subject at this particular grade, it allows us to then intentionally and strategically focus resources and initiatives towards them.

start time: 1528:51:30.000
end time: 1532:33:10.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Do we see, I mean, I know that this is a compliance issue, but do we see a problem with this aggregation? I would think it'd be harder to measure the supergroup.

start time: 1532:41:30.000
end time: 1533:08:02.000
confidence: 0.77
E: It is not.

start time: 1533:09:46.000
end time: 1533:30:10.000
confidence: 0.91
C: Or is it by district?

start time: 1533:32:10.000
end time: 1548:05:00.000
confidence: 0.96
E: It's not without its challenges is what I would say to that. But we, as always with everything, we give our best effort and we try to make sure we're doing exactly what we're required to do in order to measure these and monitor their progress. ODE actually worked with us on setting the targets over time, so they gave us some technical assistance in that regard. But they also changed students experiencing poverty as a new group for ode, and they've changed what all and who all is included in that group. So it also makes trend data not necessarily comparable because the group has expanded to include students on Medicaid, for example, are now considered to be students experiencing poverty, where last year that wasn't the case.

start time: 1548:12:40.000
end time: 1550:39:28.000
confidence: 0.98
C: So it's kind of. It's hard to have a baseline probably this year or last year, but eventually there will be some trend data.

start time: 1550:41:44.000
end time: 1551:03:00.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Eventually, yes.

start time: 1551:11:20.000
end time: 1553:16:02.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So thank you. What testing do you use? What data is used different from what you reported before?

start time: 1553:17:46.000
end time: 1560:10:24.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Sure. So it's around. Thank you for the question, Director Sullivan. It's around the five, what ODE calls the five common metrics. So it's things like attendance rate, the percentage of students in ninth grade are on track, the graduation rate, our third grade reading data, or fifth grade math data. So those two are similar, but again, they don't disaggregate them in the Same way that we do here in pps.

start time: 1560:12:32.000
end time: 1561:55:28.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Because we didn't feel we'd done that well when we looked at the data earlier.

start time: 1561:57:44.000
end time: 1562:43:40.000
confidence: 0.98
E: No, no, no. We certainly have work to do.

start time: 1562:50:00.000
end time: 1564:19:28.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So it comes with a different conclusion.

start time: 1564:21:04.000
end time: 1564:33:40.000

And that we've held pretty steady with our reading and we haven't backslid very much. Right. And so when we think about national stories, when I think about my colleagues and the council, when we have our chief meetings or our research director meetings, they're often reporting losses over time each year, and we aren't necessarily seeing that same exact thing. So I believe that's what Dr. Jefferson was describing, if I may speak for her. Yes.

confidence: 0.95
E: Sure. Good evening board members, Student director Conseve and superintendent Armstrong Konsebi. Excuse me. Wanted to provide just some highlights that were covered in the memo and then invite any questions you may have. Overall, as we've shared, our enrollment is trending down and is projected to trend down for the next. I believe now we're at the next eight years before it's supposed to level off and then slowly begin increasing. So our October 1st enrollment for this year is 40,718 students. That's down 1.5% from last year, which is the equivalent of 628 students. We see decreases in enrollment in all of our grades except grades 3, 3, 6, 8 and 11. We also see differential enrollment across our schools. We have 48 schools that came in under their projection and 33 schools that came in with more students than were projected. Another data point that's included in the memo is class size at the elementary level. And so currently our class sizes, as you can see by the on pages.

start time: 1661:18:40.000
end time: 1661:52:20.000
confidence: 0.99
C: I think I see them on page three.

start time: 1662:02:40.000
end time: 1677:04:40.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yes. And class size information begins with the colorful histograms in the latter portion of the memo. They are ranging at the elementary level from between 10 students and 33 students. And our average elementary class class size is 22.4 students. And so this is information that we provide annually. Sometimes there's been a presentation, sometimes it's just been an informational update to the board via email. And we continue to monitor enrollment. The 10 day drop is an ongoing thing, right? Anytime someone misses 10 days, they're supposed to be 10 consecutive days are supposed to be dropped from enroll. So with that I wanted to just invite questions you may have about the enrollment data or the class size data.

start time: 1678:56:20.000

B: Speaking as first my little baby Captain Miss. She wanted me to jump in and we can do some because I had, I don't know about 10 questions but I'll just start with my first couple and people can pepper them in. Has there been any analysis, macro or micro about the larger than expected drop given they're across many grades and not a result of like the birth rate drop which we'd seen kindergarten and do we and I'll just maybe combine the question also do we have any data from the 10 day drop? Like what what point in the school year are people dropping? Are they dropping at the end of the year? October? And then do we conduct any sort.

start time: 1697:07:24.000

start time: 1698:52:20.000
end time: 1727:32:30.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Sure. So that was a few questions. Let me try to answer them as I can recall them. Director Edwards first are projections in terms of an analysis because mer dropping in grades other than just kindergarten and first grade. We anticipated those drops based on our projections except in kindergarten where we overestimated our protected enrollment and we missed that mark by 250 students. And so in working with our as you know we contract with Portland State University, the Population Resource center and in our working with them we are we constantly one of the reasons we redo the projections every year is because we get sort of we can refine the model and what we may project out at this point for three years from now may change next year at this time. The 10 day drops. That's an excellent question. I appreciate it. The 10 day drops happen on an ongoing basis. So while we have to give a snapshot of enrollment as of the first workday in October, the 10 day drops are occurring throughout the month of September, October, they're occurring even now if a student by chance doesn't attend for 10 consecutive days because that's the requirement as we report our attendance in our average daily membership, which some people call adm, which factors in to our enrollment funds. We have not at the district level done engagement with parents who either their students no showed or were dropped after the 10 days that I'm aware of.

start time: 1727:53:30.000
end time: 1739:38:34.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I mean I just look at PPS being at 40,000 students. That's the lowest number I think I've seen in 25 years for PPS even after the 2002 recession in which they were going to close close schools for five weeks. So it's a pretty shocking number just the cumulative impacts. And I wonder if we can if there's a relatively just easy data search. So when a student goes to a different district and there's a request from another district for the student records, do we have a way that like that automated. We can just sort of collecting that to see.

start time: 1739:41:22.000
end time: 1741:57:10.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I would need to follow up because that usually happens on a school to school basis and I don't know that we have a way of measuring that from the central office.

start time: 1742:26:10.000
end time: 1761:09:00.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Yeah, I was just going to say that's absolutely an important data source and I appreciate the questions around. I think what I hear is that we're continuing to decline. I think as predicted, not a surprise, not an organ issue. It's a across the United States issue and what are we going to do about it? Right. And so we're leaning into conversations. I know I don't necessarily have are those who support and manage enrollment here specifically. But I can tell you for all of the work that's happening across our city with affordable housing work that we're doing to make sure that we put new schools in our communities that will continue to attract families in our that our programs and our services are high quality. When we look and do a deep dive of the data where you look at where there were some infrastructure failures like the roof during the rainstorm, while I don't have qualitative or quantitative data to say like that's it, that there was a significant drop in enrollment at those sites. And so I think it's a comprehensive strategy to respond to an issue that's plaguing many of us across the.

start time: 1761:19:40.000
end time: 1779:26:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I mean I just think we have a value proposition that I look at the modernized high schools. Like if you told me we have 1500 students at McDaniels there was a debate whether we should build McDaniels for like 1200 students because their enrollment was high, 8 hundreds or 9 hundreds. And so like the value proposition of a brand new school like okay, is that why we have so many students there? Same thing with Roosevelt. Like we're only going to build 1400 and now it's over that. So having I think we've got a great value proposition. So where are we losing people? I frequently talk to parents. It seems like middle school like oh like the middle school years. I want to tuck my child away somewhere and then come back to pps. These brand new high schools have lots of offerings but it just seems like being able to figure out why people are leaving because again it's not birth rate. And I do think we have something that some competitive advantages that other places may not in terms of getting families back.

start time: 1779:35:20.000
end time: 1792:41:30.000
confidence: 0.96
F: I will follow up in an email just later on about other data that we have when I have a chance to talk to some other teammates. But I appreciate that and I again, just. I want to underscore that we're doing everything we can to change the narrative about some spaces and then some things. You know, there are city issues and birth rate and some of the other things that are impacted when we don't have as many kiddos born in the years that we need them to be born to populate our kindergarten classrooms. But what we don't want is for our facilities to be an issue, our programs or our services to be an issue, that our families know that they can receive everything that they need when they arrive here.

start time: 1792:59:50.000
end time: 1799:03:22.000
confidence: 0.96
A: To add to that, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't know where I saw this, but I think recently Catchment data was also released. And if I'm correct, it seems like the Catchment data is showing that there's been increases in the last year, last couple years in most of our schools. So that would suggest it's not necessarily people leaving, but it's just that there's just less kids.

start time: 1799:05:46.000
end time: 1802:50:30.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Well, and I think affordable housing helps with that. We're seeing more properties that are offering our families an opportunity to be able to afford to live in Portland, and that certainly helps us.

start time: 1803:42:10.000
end time: 1841:07:30.000
confidence: 0.94
D: I want to say a couple things on this. Now. I understand everybody looking, you know, at, you know, what happens or not happens. I'm looking at the Data from like 2008, 2009, and from 2009, 2008, 2009, all the way up to 2017, 18, we had a growth every year, year over year growth. But now from then on, we've been having a growth downward. Like at the top of 2017, 18, we had almost 44,000, well over about 45,000 students. Now, right now we're on a decline. And it sounds like we're going to be on a decline. Going from the stuff from PSU to now, we're down to 40,000. So I say all that to say that we have to make sure that the decisions that we're making today is taking consideration of what's happening and looking at all the variables, right. We have a city that don't really have an anchor employer here. Right. We do a lot of exports here. Housing costs is high here. Taxes is high here. So I think we want to make sure that while we're looking at all these. This data, that we really are using this data to make the best decision we can make today for tomorrow as well. Because what we don't want to do is we see the data, we see the trends that it's going, we continue to make decisions and hope for, you know, something to happen later on, and then it ends up being a direct harm to our children later on. And one of the reasons I brought that up when I first got on the board, I remember Elizabeth Deal was saying, oh, they're going to come back, they're going to come back, they're going to come back. And now it's been four years later and they haven't came back. And, and had we did stuff then to mitigate that, we might not have had a biggest drop or biggest amount of cuts that we have to do now. So I just want to make sure that we be mindful of the decision we're making today looking at the trends, looking at the data that we have, and hopefully make better decisions for the future of our students and community later on.

C: I had a question I also wanted to Director Broom Edwards, When I first got on the board, I heard a lot about how Jefferson High School should be. Perhaps we should look at making a smaller high school. Even when the Population Research center told us that there were two areas in town, I've quoted this before, that were going to experience growth due to the increase of subsidized housing, or at least housing starts in the Franklin Jefferson clusters. And those, you know, those words that we heard four years ago are now coming into fruition because it's taken that long to get a permit. But there's a lot of housing being built in the Jefferson cluster, and I'm really glad that we have the ED specs to guide us in terms of how large that building is. One of my questions is, and I haven't looked at this myself, do we know how many children are how many students are leaving due to displacement or being homeless where there's a lot of transition, like moving around, do we have an idea? Because, yes, there's a lower birth rate. We can't really do anything about that. As a future grandmother, believe me, I've tried. But do we know how many of those I'm looking at, those schools that have really high free and reduced rates, do we have. And also correlating drop in enrollment, do we know how much of that is attributed to housing or having to leave that particular neighborhood school?

start time: 1868:20:00.000
end time: 1874:56:40.000
confidence: 0.94
E: We've not done an analysis along those lines. However, my understanding of our McKinley Finto work is that if I become homeless and I'm attending your school, I should still be able to attend your school, even though I don't still have that permanent residence. So it's certainly a great question that I can look into seeing what we might be able to understand.

start time: 1875:05:40.000
end time: 1892:40:22.000
confidence: 0.95
F: And I appreciate the research questions that are being asked. And I just want to reemphasize one of the points that Dr. Adams made, which is that October 1st being that census date where we're able to capture the data. And so when we think of October 1st to November 19th and the 45 or 30ish school days that happen in between is a very small snapshot in time. And so I can imagine in another month or two, we'll have more data to share out, both qualitative and quantitative, on not only what's occurring in many of our areas across Portland, but some strategy that we've deployed to specifically address that. So I guess that's a long way of saying that we will be presenting more data as time goes on. But for this early snapshot in time, there's still some things that we're uncovering and looking to get some more information on things that weren't historically captured before.

start time: 1892:43:26.000
end time: 1898:57:10.000
confidence: 0.94
C: And I appreciate that. I appreciate Director Holland's line of questioning, too. But, yeah, I was just. I was curious about that. And I don't think we need evidence that Portland is expensive to live here and that there is a rate of displacement, especially in higher. I'm sorry, higher poverty neighborhoods. But I would appreciate that extra analysis.

confidence: 0.96
E: Okay. This is a little bit. Maybe the way you touched on this a little bit, Dr. Adams. I was surprised at the variability, and it raised some questions. So, for instance, you know, we gained 33 third graders, but lost 160 fourth graders. We gained 78 sixth graders, but lost 128 seventh graders. And it just made me think, I don't think there's something amazing going on in sixth grade and something horrible going on in seventh. Seventh grade. I think there's some natural variability there. And so, you know, to the superintendent's point, I know we don't have the answers. As you continue to explore that, it would be really interesting to sort of suss out what's a natural variability for our district, for districts of our size, versus what's a trend, you know, and again, without any evidence, when I look at this, I see a trend in the early years, which feels more like could be birth rate, could be dissatisfaction, you know, with. With pps, could be other alternatives, could be less of an interest in school, because we're seeing that as well. But when I see some of the other grades, it looks more just like, yeah, some years you have more fifth graders, and some years you have fewer. But anyway, I think that's going to be important too. Sort of what's. What's a natural variability and what's a concerning trend I can certainly have the team work on. I think one of the places we could start is understanding just the overall level of mobility in the district. My guess is that it's a little bit higher than we might believe and suspect that may contribute to some of this. But let me have the team work on some of that.

end time: 1946:26:40.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Absolutely. I will say I just so appreciate these questions. I think, as we know, there's a national movement around absenteeism and the rates and the number of our kiddos who aren't attending school on a regular basis and the impacts of accessing the educational program because of it. And so these questions on enrollment aligns with things I'm finding in my 100 days of school transition. And I'll have a more comprehensive report in January that speaks to some strategy. But I will tell you enrollment and a focus on not only the kiddos who are enrolled here, but then actually show up every day to class. And that will be included in what my response will be moving forward over the years.

D: The question, maybe this is for my colleagues. Do, do any of this data that we're seeing right now informs how we plan on moving forward, like, with our bond? So, like, and I'm just say this as an example. Once again, I'm saying this as an example. You know, when I look at, like, Jeff.

D: And I see their numbers keep declining, you know, and I know Director DePass keeps talking, talks about, you know, some of the housing stuff that's coming up. But, you know, we've been, you know, they've been building affordable housing in north and Northeast Portland for a little bit, and the numbers haven't came up. They're. They're continually just to decline. Is. I'm asking my colleagues, is there something that either we could be doing to help figure this out? And some of the decisions that we're making, like, for instance, boundary changes for Jefferson, you know, is that somewhere we can go to where we are getting more students? Because when I look at 459 students out of high school, even if we built one for 1700 kids, is that really the best way to be spending our dollars or targeting our dollars, are we looking to make decisions that said, okay, if we do this, we can raise that 459 students up to 16, 1700 students.

end time: 1989:35:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: It's a great question, Director Hollins. I would say that the thing that's unique about Jefferson is it's the only, what used to be a comprehensive high school that has no attendance boundary. So there's no. In the sense where if you live within that boundary, that's the high school you go to. Everybody gets two choices if you live within the Jefferson boundary. So it has a dual enrollment. So for me, the data is not very clean in the sense of it's not like it has a neighborhood boundary and only 490 students have chosen to go there. It has a broader neighborhood boundary where students are told, or you could go to Roosevelt, that's been rebuilt. Or you could go to Benson, that's just reopened. Or you can go to Grant, that's been rebuilt. Or you could go to McDaniel's. And so to me, it's not.

B: Not a fair comparison like, or you can stay at Jeff, which is, aside from Cleveland, like the most run down, crumbly hundred year old building. So I also think looking at that comparison, we have to do the what ifs. And so I think it was the board passed a resolution directing the superintendent to create a boundary for Jefferson. I don't think it's just 2026, but there's certainly modeling that could be done now. I mean, we know that some of our high schools are. Franklin and Grant are over the 1700. So there are some. In some cases it's a distribution issue or not. To me, that's. Those are the questions it raises. But it's not just a, oh, we don't want it when rebuild Jefferson because students haven't chosen not to go there. There's been some very deliberate things that this district has done that has led to Jefferson having 490 students.

D: I'm not saying not to rebuild it. So I want to make sure I'm clear on that. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that there's something that we can do, like for instance, boundary changes to help distribute the kids around more. I'm just saying there's anything that we can do as a board that can help these numbers, you know, not just in these schools, some of our elementary schools as well. When you look at some of our elementary schools, some of them are under enrolled. Right. When I look at schools that, you know, have, you know, 100 or 200 kids with a school that's built for 400. So I'm just asking, is it something that we can do as a board to help distribute these numbers out more equally?

C: Also just want to say that Jefferson has 459 students because that's the system we've designed for Jefferson students for much of all the same reasons that Director Brim Edwards mentioned. A systemic issue. As you know, the neighborhood's changed in the last 30 years. And so we've allowed those folks that have moved in to send their kids elsewhere, anywhere else besides Jefferson. And I think that we do have some, we have some things that we can do as a board that we can advocate for in addition to modernizing that school that will increase the enrollment there. And again, you're not seeing the housing numbers, but there are plenty of housing. Portland Housing Bureau built buildings along the interstate corridor off of that, in the interstate corridor area that are resulting in family sized homes, three buildings, I mean, I'm sorry, three bedrooms, which is a little unusual for subsidized housing. And it does take a long time to see the impact. But those buildings are also subject to the preference policy, which preferences families who've been displaced from the area due to, you know, gentrification.

E: I was of the mindset when we talk about Jefferson. I thought we were of the mindset, I was anyway, that Jefferson was like that because they wanted to be a magnet school at the time when they were developing the college program. And they. And so it was, it was something that we said. But if that, if it's something that we said, then it's also something that we could, we could undo and that if we wanted. If we wanted. I believe this is a perfect time for us to start looking at our boundaries as we have some schools that are over their capacity and then we have other schools that are under capacity. So this would be an opportune time to come in and say, okay, why don't we start looking at how we can balance this out some and in doing so ensure that the individual or the families that are wanting to go to one school, they're going there for a reason and they don't want to go to other schools for similar reasons. So how do we ensure that all of our schools have access to the high education? High, high cte, high, you know, high electives, high other things so that all of our schools are desirable, equally as desirable and not just. And not just some of our schools. Our communities are changing and the communities that used to be, they're not the same anymore. And so we know that to be the case. And if we build our schools, we're not building our schools simply for the people that are here now. We're building our schools for the people that are going to be, going to be coming into it. And people want to come back to pps. I feel like people want to be a part of pps. They, they love our, they love what we, what we do. I feel like we just need to do better. So I'm for boundaries, so I appreciate.

start time: 2082:42:08.000
end time: 2099:04:10.000
confidence: 0.96
F: The conversation on boundaries as well. We are doing preliminary data pools and we plan to launch into conversations later this spring. And I also want to uplift Director Green's point because while I know that we have boundary work to do, I would hope that our families aren't choosing Jefferson because it's the only choice, but that it's because it's their choice. We want that to be true for all of our schools, that they know that they can receive the education that they deserve and that they have access to programs and services that, that will prepare them for whatever's next. Because we know that just because they're in the boundaries doesn't mean that they're not able to find other options. And our goal is to be the option, to be the choice school for all of the kiddos in the neighborhoods where our high schools are. But yes, preliminary work is starting and then we'll go a little more aggressively into boundary conversations in the late spring.

A: Thank you. I want to kind of finish up this conversation very quick. I just want to. I'll call on you next. Thank you. I'm just going to use my short period of time just to. It's not really a question, just kind of bring attention to what I'm looking at. I know that we're looking at another year, potentially huge drastic budget cut. So there's not, I'm not asking for any personal whatever fte whatever. It's just raise awareness about Kelly, which is a Title 1 school and the Russian DLI and I don't know if you know about Kelly and I got to recently visit and they just overwhelmed with cuteness. But they do have this consistent problem, their second third grade kind of being over enrolled and again hoping to ask for like kind of creative problem solving or some attention to it. One of the things I learned when I was at Kelly is that a lot of people from Russian speaking areas, they don't actually start school until six or seven years old, which means that they enroll in school around first or second grade. So that number kind of will keep increasing for the second and third, first and second grade. And that's kind of like been kind of a rolling consistent issue. And also to mention the fact that, you know, a lot of the Russian immersion students, a lot of them, as you know there's a war in Ukraine and a lot of them have been displaced from that area. So they are undergoing some familial trauma. So it just also kind of bring attention. So I just want to use my short period of time to hopefully bring some attention to that maybe some future problem solving for the future. Thank you.

B: I guess I'm going to flip the class size so I have some other questions but I send them to you. Get the answers by email. But just want to look at the elementary classes. First of all, I'm not sure we didn't get high school, middle school, high school, which we normally do.

start time: 2135:30:16.000
end time: 2145:19:50.000
confidence: 0.95
E: We haven't provided that in the years past. We provided middle school one year and it was rather challenging because it isn't the same as like Mr. Smith's third grade class has 25 students at a high school so much around class size. Middle schools is around forecasting and scheduling that it makes it a little bit more challenging to give it to you in the way. And students in an algebra class may be in multiple different grades depending on how they've matriculated. And so it makes it's just a lot more challenging to provide something like that at the high school and middle school level.

start time: 2146:26:10.000
end time: 2164:26:16.000
confidence: 0.91
B: We have got in the past. I guess I would say while it may be challenging, it's data that our families talk to us about. So if you're students in a like oversubscribed class, if we have the data, it just we should release it with whatever caveats we need to. I'm seeing elementary class, some elementary classes over 30 students. And yes, there's some that are very low. But we know that no child is in an average class. So the students who are in the higher class sizes. This was a huge issue, as we all know last year during bargaining with Pat. And while these are our we have thresholds that are in staffing. Two questions. One, when they passed a threshold, for example, I think it's 33 or 34 students in fourth if grade. They're supposed to get some sort of relief. Did we do that this fall? We haven't every past fall.

start time: 2164:27:28.000
end time: 2166:47:40.000
confidence: 0.97
E: So there's been fall balancing that. Dr. Franco leads and so when classes came in over prescribed, extra FTE were allocated.

start time: 2167:08:00.000
end time: 2191:00:20.000
confidence: 0.93
B: So I would be interested just because we spent several months with kids out of school all around class sizes is to look at where we have our thresholds. And then in the contract there are different thresholds. And then we set up this mechanism by. If they were over the threshold, we have the school based committee that gets set up and then there is. You can get an ea, an extra teacher prepay, a stipend and from a just analytics like how did it all shake out? I think it would be worth hearing from the district about where we had classes over the threshold. Did we do what we always have done in the past, which is buy out or give a siphon to the teacher so there's still like 35 kids in class but the elementary school teacher might get a stipend or did we add an ea or do we divide the class in half and just. It would be good to have that data because otherwise we're just going to hear things anecdotally or did we have too much? I don't see a better job because it implies in the past we didn't have. Do we more effectively spread students so that we had fewer classes that bumped up Angelus restaurants?

start time: 2191:23:20.000
end time: 2212:24:20.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Those are great questions. What I can share is that Dr. Franco exhausted his set aside amount that he had in the fall. So it was all given out and that's usually done between September and October when we get those counts, unintended drops are occurring and things like that. We typically. Because I know this part, because my team's working on this right now, we typically have been offering and paying the overages when we go over the cap because there's no more at this time. For example, there's no more additional FTE to distribute. It's all been given out in terms of. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off, Director Bermobridge. And then in terms of class size committees we would need to do. Dr. Franco probably could gather that information for us. And I know that our understanding of class size committees was that they weren't to be called when it was a particular classroom, but rather a sort of school wide issue across a grade level or a content area.

start time: 2212:44:00.000
end time: 2214:11:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Did any of them convene? I mean we spent so much time talking about every word in that section of the contract.

start time: 2214:41:30.000
end time: 2223:00:30.000
confidence: 0.94
E: So we have not convened a class size committee. So the big piece is right, is you know, you go through set aside, go through that process beforehand. And then you know, with the class size committee it's up to them both site to convene first with the first piece being obviously to see if you could solve it within the sites. And so given. And actually I'll take that back. I have one to potentially meet with, but that's it.

start time: 2223:18:50.000

end time: 2238:15:18.000
confidence: 0.89
B: So like we had, we talked about bargaining is we have a certain amount of tools, the stipend which the district had always relied on, which pays the teacher extra but doesn't actually produce a change for the students in the class. And then we have the EAs and the teachers. So I'd be interested how we utilized our resources like utilize stipends for these schools. These schools got balancing FTEs and then these ones just. They are what they are.

E: That's correct. I would say that principals did a really good job of internally finding pieces. And given we had a limited number set aside, there really is a prioritization piece.

start time: 2245:28:58.000

start time: 2245:44:58.000
end time: 2250:17:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: We need to look at is can it be solved? Can the class size piece be solved internally? Right. Because we have, you know, when we staff. The reality is when we staff sections, what happens is some grade levels could.

A: Be lower and some are higher.

start time: 2250:50:38.000
end time: 2257:10:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And so we always ask principals to solve that problem first. Right. So you could understand like if all grade levels are high. Right. And if we could help with some extra FTE at some place. Right. That could help as they move people around. But if, like if you have a low kindergarten, right. And then a very high third grade.

It's when we start seeing some things consistently that we obviously that's. That's something we need to figure out if there's a trend there. And for Kellogg, I don't know specifically.

It's very good to see all in one place. All right, last thing on our item is a review work plan for the for this year. We have a draft for us to review and I believe some suggestions have already been put in there. And again this is an ongoing thing. So for the sake of time, I'm hoping that if there's any quick questions, comments or additions you would like, we can suggest that now. But that doesn't mean it has to end tonight. If there are other further suggestions that you think of later down the line, you're always welcome to email it to either board leadership or Roseanne Powell, board Senior board Manager. Any comments, thoughts, additions that you would like or subtractions from the current board work plan plan that we have in place with some additions highlighted in blue.

B: Thank you whoever made it big. I mean one thing I thought of is there's some places where I had the blue ads, but there's some places where it would be useful for staff to drop some things in. And what I would say is just as a future template, next year you don't have to do the whole thing over. It's just like some of the things are just year over year and that way you don't need to keep redoing the work plan. But there's a couple things like curriculum approval, any labor agreements, not the day to day grievances and stuff. So there's places where I wasn't sure where there could be things added by staff that we don't know about. And the one Thing. And I raised this earlier that I'm. We don't talk about tonight, but we do probably over the next two weeks is what the specific schedule for each of the individual pieces for getting the.

If we're gonna vote on it on the 7th, it's literally the second day back after Christmas break. And I just haven't seen the schedule that, like, just knowing what goes through the process of actually referring it and getting a package sent. So we need. Yeah, I'm feeling uncomfortable of, like, I don't. From what I know now, it looks like January, summer. We wouldn't have done what we need to do as a board and all be in agreement that we really do. Maybe we're not all in agreement, but we need to know how we're going to move forward with the referral and the language. And I think one of my lessons learned from last time is I want to be absolutely clear what it is we're telling voters, because it can't just be. Well, the campaign said that, but we really didn't put that in the language. So, like, an agreement on, like, what is it we're going to accomplish. I actually found the bond audit that we just received pretty informative because it reminded me of those columns and how we divided the money. And it's like, oh, yeah, that's exactly what we said we were to do, but again, getting that alignment.

end time: 2364:49:56.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So, yeah, I think what would help me, because you're starting to give me worry, too, is because I've never passed a bond before as a board member. It'd be nice to have a list. I don't know if you're able to make a kind of a to do list or a list of things that you envision that need to be done before January 7th. Because I think one of the things, like, you know, I hear you say, and I, you know, I want to hear more, but about, like, oh, we're from. Or there's these things that we have to do and things like that. And that's very general for me, and I think I just need to have, like, a very specific to do list. I think that would help a lot because then. Then we can start knocking those out. Because again, like, like, like I said, I'm very new to this, and so the list in my head is probably halfway wrong.

confidence: 0.90
B: Yeah, I Mean, just like, for example, like, we're approving the actual language that gets inserted into the, you know, it's in the voters pamphlet, and that is before the voters. And you certainly don't want to have a meeting where you come, like, on the January 7th. Like, this is the first time we've seen it and we've been talking about it, so you'd want to be backing it up to, like, we should be seeing that in December.

start time: 2371:21:16.000
end time: 2376:12:30.000
confidence: 0.91
B: So I put that together and then have a coordinates, so there's like, the larger mechanics and then there's, like, what the actual package is and needs to be coordinated. And I know that Dr. Scott probably has an idea about how we're going to get the package, but then it's also, like, the whole thing overlooked.

C: It could be like a Gantt chart that has the list of activities, and then it would be. It doesn't have to have dates, but maybe a timeline. Is it two weeks out? Is it a month out? I know that's how I like to look at projects. Or it could just be a list as well.

start time: 2384:17:26.000
end time: 2392:50:20.000
confidence: 0.92
B: So I think the very first thing would be to get Sharon, because it is like starting with when's the absolute drop date? And then obviously, we want to give ourselves a buffer, move back from that, but then schedule it out. So literally, like, you only get whatever, 10 words in the ballot title, but oftentimes it takes a lot of time to say an agreement on what it is that we're going to be asking.

E: I mean, well, it's up to the board, right. In terms of how comfortable you are. We have a December 2nd committee meeting, which I'm hoping is the last of the School Facilities Improvement and Operations Committee meeting that will then, you know, refer that vote out, you know, a package to the full board. I think there's two different pieces. Director of remembrance has talked about both of them. You know, one is the getting, you know, a board agreement, or at least a majority agreement on the substance of what is going to be the bond, how big it's going to be, and what the major categories of spending are. And then there's the logistical side of, you know, the ballot title, ballot language, referral packet. You know, together. All that work can start now. You know, and again, it's.

confidence: 0.95
E: You know, there are going to be details that need to be filled in, but I think a lot of that, you know, we can take from buyer bonds. I do think one of the questions the board is going to need to, you know, grapple with a little bit, and I don't know if we have agreement on this, is, you know, how specific to be in our language. That's a political question more than a substantive question. Personally, I think there's great value in being somewhat flexible because I think that that is actually better governance, right. When you're able to say, hey, look, there's a total. Here are the big categories of spending. But, you know, if this high school doesn't cost as much as we thought it was going to, or these things, we can move money around politically. Sometimes that makes it harder. Sometimes voters want to see, like, very, very specific numbers. I think, you know, we may have different visions about exactly how that plays out. And I think that's where the actual language that gets referred. I mean, Director, Provost, to your point, by all means, I don't want a campaign to be different than, you know, what we refer, but in terms of. I don't want them to contradict, but they will inherently be different. Right? I mean, what we refer in terms of the legal bowel language, you know, what we're talking about in a campaign may be more specific. Right. I would be very opposed to a campaign that says we will spend $420 million on Wells and $425 million on, you know, on Cleveland. You know, I think you would be too, right? Because that now you've legally locked yourself into something that you really have no future control over.

B: So I think the only time we've actually used, like, a number was in 2016.

start time: 2436:53:10.000

E: I was on the board, but I.

B: Was on the bond advisory group. We put in. It was after the whole lead on the water and paint is that at least 150 million had to be spent on health and safety issues. But other than that. And then when we found out that we were 100 million short to do the high schools, there was sort of two competing questions, like, do we build the high schools that we have the money for, or do we build the high schools that we told the community we were going to build, which was to the ed specs, because that was when they were like, well, we can just build McDaniel to 1200, and that will save us X amount of money. And, like, we don't, you know, need to build Kellogg for X amount or to do these other things. And we made a decision like we're going to build the schools. And that's why we ended up putting half of Benson on the next bond, because we decided like, we were going to do what we told the voters would be versus, like, here's the amount of money. Because the amount of money was not enough to do.

start time: 2454:18:22.000
end time: 2460:38:40.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Yes. So certainly back to your question. I am confident that between now and January 7th, there is time to, you know, to finish up the committee work, refer it to the board and get the technical language done. If there's significant disagreement on the board that requires us to go back and, you know, rejoin them, then it'll take longer. I don't say that with any judgment at all.

start time: 2460:39:20.000
end time: 2460:43:28.000
confidence: 0.67
B: Right.

start time: 2460:44:24.000
end time: 2463:00:20.000
confidence: 0.93
E: You know, if the board's a general agreement, I think we can move this pretty quickly. If there are big questions either from the board or from the community for that matter, it may end up taking longer.

start time: 2463:35:20.000
end time: 2470:09:14.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Do you think you'll have, from the staff perspective, have the materials writing on the high school, the contingencies? The admin and I had some pretty significant questions about the curriculum spend last time. I mean, because to land on a package. Yes, yes.

start time: 2470:10:02.000
end time: 2491:15:54.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I actually, I do believe that staff will be ready to go. And I think we're all supportive. And I think after conversations with you all, I think we all agree that moving forward with Ida B. Wells in Cleveland is the right thing to do. I know that there's some questions that I've raised about costs and that will address that. I agree with being a little bit more flexible in our language. I mean, certainly naming the high schools, but also realizing that there's funds to be able to do some other things, especially if we're doing some, you know, school optimization and some boundary conversations, there may need be a need to address some of those facilities with some of those funds. And so, you know, kind of keeping it open for that amount. I think there's some things that came up as of. As of. I don't want to reopen the conversation. We'll have it in December. But there are some items that was on the 3 billion list that has made its way into the 1.6. And I think from our perspective, what was on that first draft of the list, that option one that it seemed that everyone was leaning into, aside from the adjustment of the cost of the high schools, that's where we feel strongly.

start time: 2491:16:42.000
end time: 2491:39:22.000
confidence: 1.00
B: That we need to be.

start time: 2491:42:26.000
end time: 2498:56:20.000
confidence: 0.95
F: So I think the only thing that we'll need more time for is if the board has. If there's strong opinions about pulling some new things on the list that weren't part of the option that was last talked about. So that's, I think, the only thing that would give me some pause and question. Otherwise, I think if we're in agreement about option one, we're ready.

start time: 2498:59:00.000
end time: 2513:21:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, well, I don't feel like. I mean, I'll just speak for myself. I don't feel like we had a full discussion. So when there was the 3 billion list, it was like, here's not the universe, but the universe maybe in the next 15 years. And then it became the option one. But that wasn't necessarily an option one because all the board members weighed in on it. So for me, I'm not. I guess I don't want to leave the moment of like. I felt like we didn't really have a board discussion about option one because, for example, the curriculum. I didn't feel like the package that was presented actually was justified by the information, the size of it.

start time: 2513:30:40.000
end time: 2521:57:16.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So we can definitely address the curriculum, the contingency and the admin. But I think if we're all in agreement that about a billion dollars is going to go towards our buildings, I don't know if there's much left if we're still in that 1.5, 1.6. I think that's my only point is that unless there's some other major infrastructure or something that comes out, that's the only thing that would have us have to go back to the drawing board to look at.

start time: 2521:58:28.000
end time: 2532:26:44.000
confidence: 0.92
B: I mean, I'll just say there were things that, for example, some of the high schools didn't get for ed specs that it's like, do we say you're not going to get those even though they didn't have the first time around? I mean, we ended up with Roosevelt in 2017, I think, or maybe it was 2020. They didn't get. They got totally ripped off in terms of like CTE space and there's some other things at the high school. So I think it's just. And because it's going to be eight years, we should.

start time: 2532:28:12.000
end time: 2533:02:28.000
confidence: 0.92
A: They also didn't get their additional building.

start time: 2533:03:24.000

A: To the current, the current minimum.

E: It was supposed to be another building that was going to be built on the east side. They were promised that and it has never come back. So is the proper term.

start time: 2537:02:10.000
end time: 2538:52:42.000
confidence: 0.88
B: I mean, each school is going to have their own thing, whether it's like the grants that they get, the lights. Every other high school has them.

start time: 2538:53:06.000
end time: 2549:33:10.000
confidence: 0.95
F: That's just part of the Package cost continues to increase. I mean, every school should have every single thing that their heart desires based on the cost. But I know we still need to address that. I think I hear the point. I think, to answer your question, we'll be prepared. Prepared to address some of those other questions that has come up about contingency, admin and curriculum. Anything outside of that. We're assuming that the buildings that are listed is what it is, and any savings for reducing the cost of high schools will be put towards other projects to be named later.

A: Thank you.

end time: 2555:29:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I'll say. And it's sort of the delicate balance. We have to be specific enough that people will vote for it. Because if we're only specific about two high schools or three, but everything else is, like, general.

start time: 2556:15:40.000
end time: 2568:52:32.000
confidence: 0.91
E: I don't think it's general. I mean, let's look again. Let's talk about the next committee meeting, because I think we've got the buckets relatively sized and what they're for. And I would encourage all board members, if you've got very specific questions that you want an answer to, make sure we've got those in. I know you have directory members, but make sure. Make sure. No, send them into Roseanne and the superintendent, and we'll make sure they are addressed either in the community meeting or we come back. So. Because I think that that'll move the process along quickly if we all wait until January 7th and say, oh, wait, I need this question answered as well. Right, Right. And again, also distinguishing between what do we need to decide for the bond and what do we need to decide for how we specifically spend the money later. We don't need to decide, you know, the gym flooring. Right. For, you know, as part of the bond.

start time: 2568:53:36.000

B: Right.

start time: 2568:58:00.000
end time: 2575:28:30.000
confidence: 0.91
E: We need to decide $1.1 billion for high school modernizations and a couple hundred million dollars for other school modernizations and a couple million dollars for technology and career curriculum athletics. Those are the buckets that we need to decide. So. Yeah. And I know some. Sorry, Director Holland, you were cutting out there. I just. We lost. You kidding?

E: For the board's approval is the district student council bylaws. Currently, we're in the process of rewriting it. I know board policy states. Any, like, changes or amendments with the district student council bylaws. It has to be approved from the board. I think it should be coming, you know, more close towards, like, the end of the year. But I just wanted to let you all know about that.

A: Great. Thank you. All right, last chance for a quick comment before we adjourn. Alright. Our next meeting is a regular board meeting on December 3rd. Now that that's said, this meeting is adjourned. That will be a long one, so get some sleep.
