And so this updated policy reflects those changes. In addition, we also the policy also committee also recommended a proposed change to instructional materials policy 6.4 0.010. And the policy was last amended in 2002. And we are committed as a district to equitable access to high quality instructional materials as defined by the instructional roadmap.

start time: 203:52:00.000
end time: 206:08:20.000
confidence: 0.90

start time: 1197:39:36.000
end time: 1199:20:48.000
confidence: 0.91

start time: 1205:11:30.000
end time: 1222:54:30.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Well, they're going to be a huge body of works, I think. I mean, it seems like they should be called out. And if we're starting any other bargaining. I don't know if we are next spring, that they should be called out in the. Okay, spring piece. Another thing that I'm wondering about on our agenda, so I'm just gonna. You can interrupt me at any time or other people want to add in. But in May and June, how we recognize student achievement. So in the past, we have recognized those students who have either received the Seal of Biliteracy, the valedictorians. I mean, everything kind of got stopped during COVID So how do we want to recognize those students? And we don't have to do it the way that we've always done it, but it seems like it's a good thing to do.

start time: 1247:43:56.000
end time: 1252:31:20.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yeah. So I think we can just kind of start labeling them where they fit in the agenda. So for instance, we going to talk about honor some students. Maybe I can go towards the part of your superintendent's report or something like that. You can just try to add that stuff in.

start time: 1253:23:00.000

end time: 1260:34:48.000
confidence: 0.93
D: I'm glad you brought that up, Dr. DePass, because I know you're going to talk about the timeline. We just want to adjust the work plan to reflect the timeline that you agree to.

start time: 1265:45:26.000
end time: 1271:23:00.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So in January, next year in January, we should discussion or we should look at the contract and actually follow the timelines that are in the contract. But it should definitely be on our work plan so that we finish it, although in a timely way.

start time: 1276:26:04.000
end time: 1277:46:38.000
confidence: 0.98
C: If I remember correctly, we were saying that that probably the best way to go about doing it.

start time: 1277:48:04.000
end time: 1277:58:02.000

E: Correct.

start time: 1278:00:26.000
end time: 1282:02:02.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So we want to get in front of it. And so how do we get in seeing that this is. This would be the first time that I was actually involved from the beginning. How do we get in shape so that we're not rolling into a situation like we were the last time you.

start time: 1282:02:26.000
end time: 1283:06:30.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Get it on the calendar in the work plan. I mean, that is the thing.

start time: 1284:31:54.000
end time: 1285:04:58.000

start time: 1285:05:54.000
end time: 1285:21:40.000

E: Before you get this.

start time: 1285:24:10.000
end time: 1287:09:36.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Right. So we should lay that though, over the work. The work plan so that we either executive session or whatever.

start time: 1287:12:48.000
end time: 1287:31:44.000
confidence: 0.77
C: Whatever you gotta do.

start time: 1287:33:12.000
end time: 1291:13:00.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Director Green School Board Partners has a really nice process, you know, an equitable process for super evaluation that I would encourage you to ask around the community.

start time: 1291:18:00.000
end time: 1292:07:40.000
confidence: 0.73
A: So I Don't mean to cut you off. Oh, there's a.

start time: 1292:42:00.000
end time: 1293:10:20.000
confidence: 0.92
C: She said yes, you did.

start time: 1294:19:00.000
end time: 1296:14:00.000
confidence: 0.85
A: All right, so we look at paying the superintendent's contract renewal over the work plan as well.

start time: 1296:44:20.000
end time: 1303:20:26.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So also, like, what are the things that are coming out of the committees? Just know that some of those things are going to be dropped in there. And I'm curious about when, like, and what type of work is going to come out of the equity contracting. Is, is that a. Well, that a policy or is it like a work session we have on it?

start time: 1303:22:58.000
end time: 1305:00:26.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I haven't thought that through. That's Andrew. And I believe there has been a report that's been.

start time: 1305:01:38.000
end time: 1305:35:54.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Is it completed, the equity report?

start time: 1305:38:42.000
end time: 1307:00:30.000
confidence: 0.99
E: It would be the report that Namco commissioned and completed.

start time: 1307:08:50.000
end time: 1308:05:50.000
confidence: 0.92
A: And I haven't seen that the task force.

start time: 1308:12:50.000
end time: 1322:41:02.000
confidence: 0.96
E: So that's just looking at our procurement practices. Just as an example. We had a RFP out of $20 million, approximately RFP that didn't have any language in it, including women owned or minority owned businesses. Because there isn't a company in Portland or in Oregon big enough that has the capacity to do the job. 100% of that 20 million will be going out of Portland, out of the state and out of our community. Unless we added in a piece about the main contractor working and subcontracting with a smaller firm that's minority woman owned. So if we look at, for instance, adding that language and making sure it complies with procurement law, then we have potential to increase the share of the utilization of women minority owned businesses.

start time: 1322:43:26.000
end time: 1322:53:18.000
confidence: 0.73
A: Okay.

start time: 1322:54:54.000
end time: 1323:28:30.000
confidence: 0.78
C: And then y'all, that's you and Andrew.

start time: 1323:31:10.000
end time: 1327:32:50.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah. I mean that would be just an example of where we might be able to improve our utilization rate. Running out of words. It's getting close to 8.

start time: 1328:00:30.000
end time: 1334:14:08.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Let us know and then we can lay that over. If I could take us back to. Oh, no, we ain't going back. Gotta go back. Let's just bear with me. Director Bermuda's mentioned having a conversation about the superintendent contract in January. And looking at the contract, it says that there needs to be six months.

start time: 1334:16:24.000
end time: 1334:55:28.000
confidence: 0.93

start time: 1334:56:24.000
end time: 1335:49:40.000

end time: 1338:44:32.000
confidence: 0.87
A: You need to at least start having conversations. The latest should have conversations. The latest would be December, but November would be. Right.

start time: 1338:46:16.000
end time: 1338:52:32.000

A: I just wanted to raise that to your attention because I.

E: Okay.

start time: 1346:37:30.000
end time: 1350:25:22.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I'm not disagreeing that we need to start the conversation earlier. I think from a very legal perspective, I'm not sure the six months that's notice of non renewal. I think the contract renewal conversations can still be happening in that period of time. Just from a technical standpoint.

start time: 1350:26:26.000
end time: 1350:43:30.000
confidence: 0.91

start time: 1395:05:00.000
end time: 1412:24:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Some of this stuff, you know, we look at. Some of the stuff can just literally be literature that we send out. And so when we send out the literature, that's what we're expecting you to look at. And then if you have some questions, we can go over the questions. One thing I don't want to do is for us to get the material and then staff rereads the material to us. I had a good public education, so I know how to read, so I don't need to be read to. So if we can get that information, look at that information ahead of time. Public school, you know, we make sure we be efficient. So reading this stuff because I'm assuming that everybody read it and if they have questions, great. But I don't, you know, everything and we're kind of go through the stuff. Everything don't need to be a presentation. Some stuff can just be information that is not to everyone and then they can look at it as well. All right, all right. Going once.

confidence: 0.92
D: This is a. I mean I will tell you from a governance perspective, it is viewed universally is very important. OSPA says it, Grayson School says it. It's been a somewhat frustrating process. I'll just say personally here when we did it the first few years on. So I mean, I agree with Julia. I think it's a great thing to do. I think we should have a conversation as worried about how we want to.

end time: 1450:04:34.000
confidence: 0.97
D: I don't think we should just do it as a throw exercise. I think we're going to do it. We really need to take the time and it takes some time, really rethink and reflect and think about, you know, I mean, it's kind of. It's kind of similar to what we did, you know, Harvard Business School, but.

start time: 1467:36:20.000
end time: 1468:26:00.000
confidence: 0.97
A: All right. Anything else for the board work plan?

start time: 1468:34:30.000
end time: 1471:13:02.000
confidence: 0.98
B: I'm just looking at the way this is presented and maybe. Maybe this isn't the final one, but the very top. It has board priorities and no, this is not.

start time: 1471:16:06.000
end time: 1473:11:42.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So I got this from Roman and I was trying to put all the stuff together so you can just get.

start time: 1473:12:06.000
end time: 1473:28:14.000
confidence: 0.80
D: Rid of the priority.

start time: 1473:30:22.000
end time: 1474:53:30.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Okay. I was going to add this tenants contract and evaluation of that.

start time: 1474:59:50.000
end time: 1475:12:10.000
confidence: 0.64
D: That.

start time: 1475:37:20.000
end time: 1476:13:00.000
confidence: 0.96
C: But that if we're getting rid of that, then it's.

start time: 1476:22:40.000
end time: 1480:24:40.000
confidence: 0.91
A: That was just something I had to put on. Like I said, it's a job. But that's. Yeah, we got different. We got a whole lot of parts. So then I. I did see, though, Roseanne took the stuff off where, you know, we were going to the schools.

start time: 1480:27:20.000
end time: 1480:46:16.000
confidence: 0.99
D: I have that.

start time: 1480:48:48.000
end time: 1482:22:16.000
confidence: 0.93
B: You're still doing that. But it's just there's a reason why I moved that.

start time: 1482:23:28.000
end time: 1483:31:10.000
confidence: 0.82
A: Oh, I had it going to. You know, I have.

start time: 1483:31:50.000
end time: 1484:23:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I have some cubs out there trying to get those figured out.

start time: 1484:23:50.000
end time: 1489:12:10.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Okay, great, Great. All right. Any other things for the board work plan by going once, twice. All right. All right. So I will give you this information so we can.

start time: 1489:42:30.000
end time: 1490:07:58.000
confidence: 0.92
B: I was taking notes in the document, too.

start time: 1490:08:54.000
end time: 1494:33:46.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Okay. Do you need my notes? Give them to you now. So be done with that. And then we will have this out to everybody by two weeks. Is that a good enough time?

start time: 1494:34:58.000
end time: 1494:47:10.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Yeah.

start time: 1495:52:50.000
end time: 1498:23:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Okay. So the next thing we have on the list and the last thing we have on the list is the no two things you guys asked.

start time: 1498:52:30.000
end time: 1499:17:30.000
confidence: 0.80
C: Four protocols.

start time: 1499:37:50.000
end time: 1505:40:50.000
confidence: 0.89
A: So on the board protocols, I'm really going to go over section three, which is mediums. It should be page five, I think. Five, six and seven, I believe. Three, four, three, four, five. Three, three, four and five.

start time: 1506:03:10.000
end time: 1507:36:38.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Okay, so what I'm just curious like what, what's the, what is the process here or what?

start time: 1507:38:54.000
end time: 1512:37:12.000
confidence: 0.90
A: So the goal is this, the process of this. So we're going to go over work plan between the work protocols and different work sessions. And the goal is by the end of the year we will have worked with all of these and then this is something we can adopt at the end of this year, end of the school year.

start time: 1512:40:06.000
end time: 1513:15:16.000
confidence: 0.90
B: And in the meantime, are we adopting.

start time: 1513:15:48.000
end time: 1513:37:20.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Sections at a time?

start time: 1513:54:20.000
end time: 1514:27:20.000
confidence: 0.93
A: We can. That's a great idea.

start time: 1514:38:20.000
end time: 1518:01:56.000
confidence: 0.97
B: In the mean, I mean we have some operating protocols right. Right now that the board voted on in 2021. So those are in place until we replace them with something else.

start time: 1518:03:48.000
end time: 1530:57:00.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Correct. All right, so the first one is meetings. And this roughly just three sections. Once again, I'm assuming everybody read the board protocols. Right. So I'm gonna go through each section. A B1, B2, B3. And I'm assuming everybody's okay because I didn't hear anything about them. But I do want to talk about B4. I want to be number four. So meeting. So this is number three under meeting. So agenda creation. I'm assuming everybody is in agreements with that.

start time: 1531:22:00.000
end time: 1531:43:12.000
confidence: 0.82
B: The other thing, I read it before.

start time: 1531:43:36.000
end time: 1532:31:44.000
confidence: 0.96
A: They got here and they didn't have any questions.

start time: 1532:32:32.000
end time: 1540:36:40.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Well, I, I read it, but I didn't know what you wanted us to do with it because I have provided previous comments on this. So for example board chair prioritize items that the board is legally required to consider have direct impact on student achievement. Or it's a. Or recommended by a board committee for consideration. I mean it seems like a board committee sends something to the full board, it gets put on the agenda.

start time: 1542:13:10.000
end time: 1542:59:26.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Well, I mean what, what section are you. So I guess I'm.

start time: 1542:59:58.000
end time: 1543:27:10.000
confidence: 0.82
D: I guess I'm assuming that that's under.

start time: 1543:27:50.000
end time: 1543:47:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: A one would do that.

start time: 1543:47:50.000
end time: 1545:47:58.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I just don't want to make it be required because the chair still has the authority. Yeah.

start time: 1545:48:14.000
end time: 1545:57:50.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Can I ask a.

start time: 1545:58:30.000
end time: 1546:03:42.000
confidence: 0.84
A: It's.

start time: 1546:04:46.000
end time: 1562:06:50.000
confidence: 0.93
D: It's a question of Liz. I think from legal, from a parliamentary perspective out of the way this is written or chair this final decision on the agenda. So what's pre populated on the agenda was going to be there. But am I correct that at any board a member can make a motion, any one member can make a motion that would then be subject to, you know, majority vote to bring something to second not on the agenda. And so I think that's to, so this is why to your point, I think you're making a really good point. Right. If a committee's passed something out, it doesn't necessarily mean a majority. It means, you know, there's, there's a significant number of board members. I think if chair is going to put it on. I think if a chair chose not to, then that would be an opportunity for the committee chair to bring a motion and get a second and a majority. Again, we're kind of in that realm of hypotheticals that probably aren't going to happen. But that's why I, I think it makes sense that the chair gets to decide what the agenda is, but it's really a majority of the board that gets to decide what we talk about.

start time: 1562:14:30.000
end time: 1564:50:46.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Well, in my 10 years on the board, I don't think if a committee's recommended something, it's never been not placed on the agenda.

start time: 1564:52:38.000
end time: 1565:00:22.000
confidence: 0.75
A: Okay.

start time: 1565:01:26.000
end time: 1571:40:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: And, and so I'm kind of thinking like the committee's members spend a fair amount of time on something that it seems just like disrespectful and to the board members serving on that committee because, because frankly, board committees can't actually take action. They just make recommendations to the board. So.

start time: 1572:28:00.000
end time: 1573:50:48.000
confidence: 0.93
D: But in your, but it just, in your time you said it never has happened, but we haven't had a protocol that requires it.

start time: 1573:51:44.000
end time: 1574:09:12.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So I don't, I don't know.

start time: 1574:10:56.000
end time: 1575:31:00.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Well, so it just, it kind of, it kind of asks the question do we need to include it in here?

start time: 1575:36:00.000
end time: 1582:03:20.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I'll just say I don't like how a lot of this is phrased because it's very prescriptive and top down it's kind of like the board chair will do X, which isn't how we've ever operated. It's, I mean the board chair's responsibilities. Are we doing something different outlined in the board policies.

start time: 1582:04:40.000
end time: 1583:00:56.000
confidence: 0.87
D: So I'm suggesting it's okay to do something different.

start time: 1583:02:08.000
end time: 1587:43:00.000
confidence: 0.92
A: I see on your too it says majority of the board determines that an item be a focus of the board work. So if that committee is, you know, board, they didn't actually put that on there too. Right in the last line.

start time: 1587:54:40.000
end time: 1591:10:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I just don't think like committees should have to like make a motion from the, from the floor to bring something committees.

start time: 1592:18:40.000
end time: 1594:23:52.000
confidence: 0.93
D: You know, the other side of that I'm going to use Michelle and me because we're such row. You Know, if as I can't even.

start time: 1594:24:16.000
end time: 1594:34:32.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Think of a good.

start time: 1594:34:56.000
end time: 1607:14:58.000
confidence: 0.93
D: But if it's a part of our contract, you know, work that we're dealing with, you know, we came up with something just way out there and we said, yeah, we want this on. And Gary and Herman looked at that and they're like, no, like that is not. No, we're not going to bring that on. The question that you're getting at is should we have to, should we automatically get it on there, in which case it'll then probably be going down or should we have to say to bring it to a board meeting and get a majority? I think in practice it's not going to matter either way because if majority is in support of what Michelle and I have done, that a majority would add it to the agenda or would automatically go to pass. If a majority is not, then it probably doesn't get on. But yeah, that's kind of that.

start time: 1607:17:14.000
end time: 1607:51:10.000
confidence: 0.86
E: We're just a task force though. We're not.

start time: 1608:15:30.000
end time: 1614:23:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I think it takes the power away from the board chair and I think it takes the power from everyone. You know, when you talk about the board chair, vice chair and superintendent, I think it takes the power away from them to do that. And then if that's the case, then what's the point even having a board chair? If anybody, any committee can just say, hey, we're going to put everything we want on the agenda.

start time: 1614:28:50.000
end time: 1615:47:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: You have to have like, you appointed the committees.

start time: 1615:53:00.000
end time: 1616:33:20.000
confidence: 0.65
A: Yeah, they're still people.

start time: 1617:02:20.000
end time: 1628:53:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Well, I'll just say because the way our structures work, we're all elected by our, by the constituents. So we. With equal powers. So the board. So why would the board chair like not move forward with what a committee recommend a committee that board chair had formed and that the, actually the committee had, that the board had approved committees. I'm just thinking like it kind of sets things up. It's like you may just be wasting your time because you could spend four months working on something and then the board chair just decide not to move it forward.

start time: 1628:55:10.000
end time: 1629:26:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So then what's the power of the board chair?

start time: 1629:36:10.000
end time: 1630:32:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Well, it's what's outlined in our, our policies.

start time: 1630:34:10.000
end time: 1632:52:50.000
confidence: 0.91
A: The only, only thing the board chair does is basically just facilitate, facilitate meetings.

start time: 1632:54:10.000
end time: 1642:22:50.000
confidence: 0.95
B: You run, you run the meetings, you appoint, you appoint the committees and the committee chairs seating chart. But you're, I mean in essence, in essence, all of our constituents deserve us to have similar hours. I mean you don't have to put it in. I'm just saying. And in, in 10 years. And frankly, if I was on a Committee. And I. And if I was on a committee and we spent six months doing something and then the chair decided like, I don't, I don't like that. I'm not gonna put it on the agenda.

start time: 1642:24:10.000
end time: 1642:59:38.000
confidence: 0.68
A: Yeah, yeah.

start time: 1642:59:54.000
end time: 1643:15:06.000
confidence: 0.91
G: I mean, that's a good point.

start time: 1643:16:18.000
end time: 1643:26:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I get it.

start time: 1643:27:30.000
end time: 1643:47:38.000
confidence: 0.78
D: But if you just bring in a judge's.

start time: 1643:47:54.000
end time: 1647:16:38.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Bring a resolution at that point, you know, the majority. I guess it kind of reminds me of the mayor, right. If he don't have veto power, he just, He's a figurehead, and I just don't see the point of that.

start time: 1647:17:34.000
end time: 1649:35:30.000
confidence: 0.92
B: But the mayor is elected, the mayor not a member of the city council. And our policies have. Here's what the role of the chair.

start time: 1650:20:30.000
end time: 1665:40:10.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Got you. All right, so let's just go one by one. So let's just take. I guess my thing is we just take a majority. I don't know. I won't say. I don't say vote is only on the section, but can we just kind of do like a vote on the section then as we go through each section and then we get that into the. So let's just. We're going to start with A. And we got an hour left. So all in favor of director for networks addition to add four committees to be able to add things to the agenda, say Aye. Aye. 3. All opposed say no.

G: Because it's a great responsibility. It's great power. That's the thing. Right. So like I.

start time: 1679:31:36.000
end time: 1693:23:32.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Well, here's what I'd say when we have elected. I mean, myself included is the. The board chair, as, I mean, longer discussion about. There's things in here that are contrary to our policy, but it's like what our protocols have said. They have been. So it would be a change, I guess I would say is like, if we didn't want to put that in there. The board chair should definitely tell a committee, like, don't work on something if you're not going to put something on the agenda to, like, I'm not inclined to put this on the agenda because I think it would be disrespectful to. For a committee to spend a lot of time working on something and then not have it. It's just. I mean, we're Supposed to be a resource to the board.

start time: 1693:26:36.000
end time: 1694:43:32.000
confidence: 0.93
E: And so for the fundraising policy, for.

start time: 1694:43:56.000
end time: 1694:55:20.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Instance.

start time: 1695:23:40.000
end time: 1696:51:56.000
confidence: 0.91
E: We want to put that, we want that on the agenda if it, you know, can move through the committee.

start time: 1696:53:08.000
end time: 1704:50:48.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Well, anything, anything we work on. If it's, it's not a good use of staff's time or the community's time or board members time, if it's not gonna. Like I say, the committees are supposed to be like a resource to work on things in more detail and make recommendations to the board. And we could like have them come to the board and be like, we're gonna table this because, like, we don't think it's a good idea. But I also don't think we should have committees spending a lot of staff time and board members time on things that aren't going to actually ever get to the board.

start time: 1704:51:44.000
end time: 1709:14:20.000
confidence: 0.89
A: So to me, it actually make it seem like then we're all chairs, committees chair, vice chair. We're all the same at that. So that means there's no need to even be voting for board chair. We don't need to vote for someone. We're just going to be moderating meetings.

start time: 1709:28:00.000
end time: 1709:47:00.000
confidence: 0.80
B: That's not right.

start time: 1710:05:20.000
end time: 1713:58:06.000
confidence: 0.91
A: But that's what it comes out to. Like if we have this board chair, only thing they're doing is get to pick the committees, get to pick the members. Then what else did the board chair does?

start time: 1714:00:38.000
end time: 1714:16:30.000
confidence: 0.84
D: Absolutely right.

start time: 1714:18:30.000
end time: 1715:18:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: But you're not given absolute veto power over what?

start time: 1715:27:50.000
end time: 1716:05:02.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Yeah, I mean, what else did the board chair do?

start time: 1716:06:46.000
end time: 1716:57:02.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Okay, well, it's outlined in the board policies.

start time: 1716:59:26.000
end time: 1719:07:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Well, right now it's outlined as the board gets to make a decision on what gets on the agenda. Why would we take that away?

start time: 1719:29:20.000
end time: 1725:28:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Well, so you think what I say is like, if you think there's a topic that you don't want to have brought to the, to the board or you're not going to put on the board agenda. It seems the courtesy to tell people, like, don't even discuss that because it's, it's not a good use of board members time.

start time: 1725:54:50.000
end time: 1726:01:06.000
confidence: 0.41
D: Maybe.

start time: 1726:01:38.000
end time: 1727:54:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Or maybe the thing is you tell us and then we'll, you know, we can vote as a board about whether we want to have a discussion about this.

start time: 1727:54:50.000
end time: 1730:53:54.000
confidence: 0.91
D: I think that's the important. Even this doesn't give the board chair veto. This gives the board chair that he gets that or they get a set initial agenda.

start time: 1730:56:02.000
end time: 1731:35:14.000
confidence: 0.84
C: But I'm in a good way.

start time: 1731:38:02.000
end time: 1735:52:12.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I want to get away, I think the other side of, I mean the other side of adding. And I want to be clear, I actually don't feel that strongly about this either way, because I think the end result is the same that I think whether committee chairs can automatically put something on. Not if a majority wants something to be on the agenda.

start time: 1735:54:36.000
end time: 1736:04:44.000
confidence: 0.93
A: The agenda.

start time: 1736:05:32.000
end time: 1740:51:24.000
confidence: 0.94
D: If they don't, it won't, but that's it. The other side, though, just. You know what you're saying, Julia, I'm not a board chair this year, so if we add in, at my request. Thank you, Gary. If we add in that board chairs can automatically bring stuff in.

start time: 1740:51:32.000
end time: 1740:56:50.000
confidence: 0.52
A: The.

start time: 1740:58:20.000
end time: 1745:20:06.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Sorry, the board chair and the committee chair's gonna stuff, then that actually, you're talking about seven equal people. I actually will have no, like. Like, there's nothing like, I'm just like, oh, I guess the only way I can put anything on the agenda is by just raising it as a motion during a meeting. Right. You know.

start time: 1745:22:38.000
end time: 1745:58:30.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Well, actually, you're on committees, right?

start time: 1746:00:30.000
end time: 1746:30:14.000
confidence: 0.92
D: I'm on committees, but I'm not committee chair.

start time: 1746:31:42.000
end time: 1746:35:02.000
confidence: 0.99
E: Right.

start time: 1746:35:26.000
end time: 1749:42:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: But exact. For example, I've met with Eddie and Michelle, who are on the policy committee about what items you want to move forward this year. We'll get them on the committee agenda.

start time: 1750:15:40.000
end time: 1750:51:16.000
confidence: 0.88
E: So those might get.

start time: 1750:53:48.000
end time: 1758:10:06.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah, but so is the concern. I just. That I. Because I. Let me. Let me actually. Let me make the argument for you. For you, and you tell me if I'm getting it right. Is the concern that a committee, you know, would do a lot of work. And let's say it's not a majority. Let's say it's a committee of three, and that that committee unanimously votes something out after doing two or three months work, and the board chair says, not interested in having a vote. And then you. You bring a resolution, and the three members of the committee vote to put it, but the four members don't.

start time: 1758:10:38.000
end time: 1758:15:58.000
confidence: 0.90
B: And then.

start time: 1758:16:54.000
end time: 1766:09:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: And then the item never actually gets a vote. You technically voted whether to put it on the agenda, but it never actually got brought forward. And. And so is the concern there that there would never be a substantive vote on that versus if you add in here, the committee chairs automatically get stuff on. Board chair might say, I don't really want it on, but you automatically get it on. And it still goes down, but it goes down four to three, and you, you know, you got a substantive vote. Is that. Is that kind of a thought process?

start time: 1766:31:30.000
end time: 1767:03:54.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Well, I just think it's really disrespect.

start time: 1767:06:02.000
end time: 1767:20:30.000
confidence: 0.54
D: Okay.

start time: 1767:36:50.000
end time: 1781:03:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: We don't have a mayor and city council system. We all get elected by. By everybody in the city, by our zones. And so having something that comes out of committee that then just gets like, basically, we're not going to do it to me, is disrespectful to both the staff and the committee members and the work. Okay. If you spend a lot of time working on something and we advance it, like, I don't want to. I don't want to come to meetings to do work that's just going to end up nowhere. The whole purpose of the committee work is to advance something to the board to make a recommendation.

start time: 1782:08:40.000
end time: 1782:47:28.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Yeah, I hear what you're saying. I do.

start time: 1782:48:24.000
end time: 1783:30:24.000
confidence: 0.86
B: And the committee and the chair of the board.

start time: 1783:33:12.000
end time: 1795:49:50.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I think what you actually. What you're actually doing is giving power to more district chair. And if that's what we're going to do, then that's fine, because then that means every committee chair is basically the chairperson because they can bring stuff to the board, which is. If that's what we're doing, that's fine. But I just want to make sure we're clear on what we're doing, that we are looking at making everybody basically a board chair. Outside of picking the stuff, we're looking at making every board chair, every committee chair basically a board chair. And if that's what we're doing, that's fine. But I just don't want us to be. I don't want us to act like that's not what's happening, because that's actually what it is.

start time: 1795:56:10.000
end time: 1809:41:10.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Actually. I'll just say for the last 20 years, the board has operated the distributed leadership model. We have committees, and that's always happened. So it's not something new. So I'm kind of. I'm actually kind of surprised we're even having a discussion about it because it seemed kind of like a. Of course that would be. What I'm reacting to is actually AJ Taking. Taking away something that we've. A practice we've always had, and we have had a distributed leadership model because we all are independently elected and the board chair is not elected. Unlike, say, Metro or the city of Portland, where. Or the. Or the county where there isn't a. Is an executive. We're all elected equally.

start time: 1809:58:50.000
end time: 1826:46:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: And I think what I might just. Actually, I think you're right. I think that has. That is how the districts operated. And you and I had some of these conversations. Julia. I do believe in a stronger board chair role. And I would actually maybe point to the last 20 years and say maybe it's time to try something different in terms of how we govern ourselves. And again, I want to be really clear. We elect the board chair. We can unelect the board chair. At any time, anytime, for board member. When Gary becomes tyrannical, you know, he will. We're just going to. Four of us step in and we're just going to, you know, take away his board chair and move on. So it's not like. It's not like you get it and then keep it for 12 months regardless. But I guess maybe I would say that maybe the board, if we think about what we learned at Harvard, maybe we would do better with more of a focus and not so much random stuff coming from seven different members that want stuff. But, like, this is our work plan. We're going to stick with it. Which doesn't mean those random things can't come up. If four people want to put them on, they can. But not just one person or two people or three people.

start time: 1826:55:40.000
end time: 1827:28:52.000

end time: 1831:54:36.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I was just going to say, when we were working together as chair and vice chair, and we had an agenda setting, we did have some board members regularly contribute an idea that came from them as an individual, not as a collective.

start time: 1831:57:48.000
end time: 1832:05:32.000

start time: 1832:55:56.000
end time: 1834:06:00.000

end time: 1865:49:00.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Sorry. I just didn't want to interrupt the good discussion happening. But I would say that I am in favor of adding specific language about committees. But also, like, I would like to take a look at the way we're phrasing that, because, like, when I think of something coming from a committee, I think of something like, the majority of that committee has said, like, we want to present this. And I don't necessarily think, like, of a committee is just the committee chair, because I do agree that the board chair, you know, has a specific role and should have some power because they're elected in that position for a reason. But I also do feel like it's important to know, like, the board works as a whole. Like, each person is represented, represents a zone, and they were elected for that zone. And I guess my question is also, like, when the public is electing people, do they all have awareness about board chairs? And also because, like, the board chair, like, there isn't typically, like, a large competition for that position. So I'm just thinking about, like, how do people who are not currently on the board view that role? And I do think that the committee work is very important, and it's Done for a reason. And I'm, I feel like we're talking a lot about like worst case scenarios but usually what goes on in the committee like and that is decided needs to be brought forward. Like I feel like it should be because they're relevant topics and it's gone through discussion and I don't know, I feel like I'm in favor of like having more leadership across the board.

start time: 1866:03:20.000
end time: 1871:59:00.000
confidence: 0.90
D: How about this? And I was going to say it's compromised but maybe, actually maybe Julie's original suggestion. How about we keep this language as it is about the board chair sending the agenda and add something that says if a committee majority, it's not a committee chair issue, but if a committee majority recommends that, you know, an agenda item come to the board, that the board chair will place that on a future.

start time: 1872:01:00.000
end time: 1877:05:42.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I think that's a good compromise. I think it's fine because like frankly committee chairs can't just put things on it. It's like a recommendation from the committee and it's very clear committees can't take actions in of themselves. I mean committee recommendation is a recommendation, but it's never like one person's.

start time: 1877:06:46.000
end time: 1880:56:54.000
confidence: 0.93
D: It's, it's sort of respecting the work that's going on in the committee. May not be a majority, some committees may be majority, but it may not afford. But it's saying, yeah, you know what if two or three members that committed majority then, then you, and again doesn't mean you have to vote for it, it just means you have to put it, you have to schedule it.

start time: 1880:58:22.000
end time: 1885:06:12.000
confidence: 0.95
B: The other thing is our policy has that the board chair is the ex officio member of every committee. So the board chair can come in like as the board chair did today and participate in the committee committee discussion.

start time: 1885:07:16.000
end time: 1885:38:28.000
confidence: 0.82
D: The worker doesn't get a vote as the ex officio.

start time: 1885:40:04.000
end time: 1886:42:44.000
confidence: 0.95
B: They're, they're in the policy. It says they're an ex officio member of every committee.

start time: 1886:44:12.000
end time: 1887:32:40.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Right. They don't vote as an ex officio.

start time: 1888:23:40.000
end time: 1897:18:50.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And frankly, I mean I say the fact that nothing, I can't remember a time where a committee chair, it just doesn't happen. It's like, I mean at least my committees are all the committees I've served on which I've served them all. It's always, it's a recommendation of the majority of the committee comes forward and the chair just presents it. But it's, it's, it's not a committee chair's idea, it's a recommendation from the committee.

start time: 1899:40:00.000
end time: 1903:13:40.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Can we write this and see what we. So where we write that in is right now back. All right, Anybody have any issues with B number one?

end time: 1905:50:16.000
confidence: 0.92
D: And this is already. This is written to reflect practice now, right, Roseanne? Yeah, I know we. We didn't formally adopt this, but we did adopt this new timeline.

start time: 1905:53:28.000

A: Yeah.

start time: 1906:56:26.000
end time: 1910:45:46.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So one of the things that this doesn't have, which I would suggest included if we're going to have these timelines for the boards, that it also include the presentations because often that's the meat of the.

start time: 1910:48:18.000
end time: 1911:26:50.000

A: Right.

start time: 1911:33:06.000

end time: 1915:45:40.000

start time: 1916:04:40.000
end time: 1917:18:24.000
confidence: 0.74
A: Maybe I'm just looking at this wrong. So each board meeting the figment will provide a draft of all items.

E: Does that.

start time: 1920:14:48.000
end time: 1926:09:50.000
confidence: 0.98
B: I'm adding it into that. If. If we don't have presentations, it just goes to the next board meeting. Because otherwise what happens is if. If we don't get the presentation, which is often the meat of the thing, how are we going to ask our questions eight days before the board meeting?

start time: 1927:04:10.000
end time: 1928:33:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: It's dependent on getting the presentation in time to read and respond.

start time: 1928:42:10.000
end time: 1930:47:06.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Maybe I'm not understood. We already get it 12 days before the meeting. Maybe I'm not understanding the question.

start time: 1930:49:38.000
end time: 1934:25:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Well, I'm adding it to the. The whole thing because it's actually. I'm adding it to the. To the last sentence because actually we don't get everything 12 days in advance. We still get presentations and they. And that we still have.

start time: 1939:50:20.000
end time: 1943:37:02.000

B: So that's what we've been. The practice we've been following. But like updates to the board, just informational updates. The board all the work sessions for this. Not a vote. We have not been doing that. So that's what I want to make sure we're getting direction on.

B: We're trying to do 12 days presentation on just like an informational report. We've not been doing that, but if that needs to change. But often, for example, it's the core. Sometimes it's like the most important presentation. Like we don't vote on the map data, but I don't want to get it during the school day or during the workday two days before or on the weekend.

end time: 1959:07:46.000

D: That's right. This says everything that's going to be. Roseanne's saying that in practice, what we've done is voting things. Voting stuff.

start time: 1959:09:38.000

B: Just based on the retreat that we had.

start time: 1959:46:18.000
end time: 1985:41:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I was just gonna say we did. We had this conversation. I mean, here's the challenge. And I mean, as a board, we can give whatever direction we want. The challenge we're going to run into. And I, I would actually, I'm going to separate out sort of vote and non vote because. But, but one of this says is, is drafts. If, if we, if we insist and we can that everything needs to be final 12 days before, it means that there are just going to be items that get delayed beyond, you know, that it just staff just don't have time or resources. And I'm going to point out to surprise anybody, we're talking about central office resources here for the most part, you know, stuff's just not going to get done and it's going to get delayed. Well, we talked about that retreat was what if we got you a draft and then, you know, what if we had to change slide 5 or we updated some numbers on slide 10, we'll let you know where those changes are. And I think Steph do a good job of that saying, you know, this slide change, this slide change, but those do sometimes change, you know, a day of day before. So I think our decision on that is are we going to insist on everything final 12 days in advance or is there some leeway there? And then I think the question about the voting, it's kind of, it's kind of similar in the sense of. You made really strong arguments last fall, Julia, that if I'm going to vote on something, I need that final information. I think the board generally agreed with that and they've been trying to do that. If they're just going to come present information, ideally we get that well in advance. But there are going to be some items that they may not have time for. And do we want as a board to say, oh, well, you just got your maps data six days before, but that's not 12. So we're not going to talk about it next week. We're going to talk about it in three weeks.

confidence: 0.92
A: A practical example would be the OSAS data. It's not scheduled for public release until first. That's not 12 days before the 26th. And if we put it in 12 days, it would not land until based on the way the board's calendaring out their meetings until October 24th.

start time: 1990:49:10.000
end time: 1992:39:58.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Yeah, I think, I mean, not that we don't need to. We're not voting on making a decision on. Should have way more leeway.

B: The thing, Andrew, that's not operation is like we're actually not getting a draft of the items. It's not like, hey, we just changed, you know, this sentence on slide 15 per your homes. But we're like not getting some presentations until literally, like right before it even on vote stuff. No, I'm. No, I think generally that the things we vote on, we get.

start time: 1999:54:50.000
end time: 2014:54:54.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Stuff we get, we get ahead of time. So I think what she's talking about is the other stuff. What I'm asked, what I want to hear more about is if it's not critical, like, if, if it's not a critical piece and this is just updated information that some numbers changed, how much do I really care, like critical things, then I feel like we need to in anything. I feel like, and this, this is just me in anything. I feel like there needs to be an exception somewhere we have to write in because stuff happens, life happens. So it. I, I'm not a rigid person. I'm just, I'm not, I'm very fluid. So there has to be an exception somewhere in my mind. But critical stuff, if it's critical, then yeah, I want to know. If it's not critical, it's just like, hey, keep this in your head. A feather in the hat. Then I don't care what I. I.

start time: 2014:55:02.000
end time: 2029:56:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Don'T think we have very many things that aren't like, they wouldn't be on the. Hopefully they're not on the agenda. But also, I mean, I think it is not professional for board members to not get something. Then it's being presented and be like. And then I, like, I can't answer that question because you didn't ask it in advance or I haven't even had a chance to read through it. And like, I asked a question. But like, that's like slide 8. But you haven't had a chance to See it and the reality is like, we have jobs. So I don't know, maybe there is a five days before for presentations that we're not voting on. But I mean, because 12 days seems like awfully long. But also I don't think we should be getting stuff the day of and then like, well, you can just sit there and like not have read it, not a thought about it because. And then ask questions that we can't answer.

D: Chair Hollins, I would just love to also, as you're having this conversation, clarify about committees because I. We also staff some committee documents 24 to 48 hours before. And so if we're going to be consistent with board meetings, we should be consistent with committees as well.

start time: 2035:52:30.000
end time: 2040:21:50.000
confidence: 0.97
G: I think maybe nice to kind of step back and just see the purpose of this section because I feel like the purpose of this section, I feel like that's a different, maybe a different issue, different section. Because I think purpose for this section is when you make a decision, there's these timelines in place so that we're all playing the same game.

start time: 2040:30:50.000

A: Right?

start time: 2040:38:34.000
end time: 2055:02:00.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Because I, I mean, this is one of the place. I was talking with Director Hollingser like a lot last month about how like, oh, you know, if, if I'm following these protocols but someone else is following a different protocol, then I don't feel like I'm playing the same game. It's not fair. Right. And so I feel like this is just setting out. These are just the standard protocols for things when we make a decision. And I like that because then we're all playing the same game in terms of presentations. I feel like that's a different issue for me. It feels like that should be a separate section because it feels like I want to hear what we get the latest stuff. And yeah, it's not ideal, but I think I'm also afraid that if we put in protection language around the worst case scenarios, we might be pitching again, constraining ourselves unnecessarily in certain ways.

start time: 2055:15:40.000

And so if I don't get it literally at least 24 hours, like I might not because usually it's like between 10 and midnight that I'm looking at stuff and trying to, and trying to provide feedback or send questions. So that, that is one thing of like getting stuff during, during the day of which.

confidence: 0.94
A: Have a comment. So if we try to regulate every scenario that comes up, I think this, this will be like 12 pages long just for one item. I think we have to look at it as a more outline. Again, this is, this is what our policy is. But there's going to be times we need to have grades. We're going to need some time when there's going to be emergencies. I don't, I don't necessarily think we have to try to regulate every emergency or every one off or even a couple times off. I think we use this more as an outline that this is our policy, our protocol. But, you know, we can make some, you know, exceptions if need be.

start time: 2082:45:20.000

start time: 2092:18:40.000
end time: 2093:42:32.000

B: So I don't think we should be getting things that. I absolutely don't think we should be getting things the day of.

start time: 2093:42:56.000
end time: 2109:10:18.000
confidence: 0.92
A: No, I agree. I agree. But I think, like I said, I think we have to have some. I think we have to have some grace emergency just in case, like when we do get stuff when we don't read it. Right. That's another thing. So I hear what you're saying, but I think just use it as an outline. And then, you know, just like I said, have grace and mercy if something happens. Because. So, for instance, if the stuff about the books didn't come in, they came in the day before, Right. Or two days before. Well, if we would have been going by this, we'd be bridging by going by this. The kids would have those books by the end of the beginning of the school year. They wouldn't get them until next month. So I understand what you're saying. That's why I said we got to have some grace and some leeway sometimes, you know, if it becomes a pattern. Then I can see, okay, you know what? We need to do some kind of, you know, thinking about how we're doing stuff, but if we're too rigid, then we're breaking.

end time: 2119:37:28.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Can I, can I finish my sentence? Is that there's not a lot of mutuality because I actually think we should be extending grace two ways. I agree with you, but I don't think it's just a one way thing. And this, this is very much written in a very directive way at board members. Like, we're idiots and we're irresponsible. I mean, even says we're inappropriate at one stage. And I think we should be missed. That section. It does, it says, like, if board members do something inappropriate all the time.

C: No, I only have questions about two and three. I know it. If, if it doesn't come in, like, do we. Do we need to add any language that says if it comes in in less than. In less than 12 days? Like so. Because I feel like he may get some stuff that's hot off the press and he may need to. Something changed. He needs to send this to me right now. And we need to be looking at it and be prepared to like to go with it. But does that still put me under the. The same four day gun? Like if the time, if the time window, if the window is smaller, does my Runway also decrease or am I still stuck with it?

D: No, I just don't want any board members to be under the impression that. That anonymity is binding because everything you create is a public record. We can choose to publish it or not. If a reporter says, I want to see every question asked by Michelle in the past, then they're going to get.

confidence: 0.93
A: Okay, good. Okay, so number four days before the board meeting, board members will have by end of day prior to the board meeting to request items be removed from the consent agenda based on the regular agenda for discussion and consideration. And for a board member request request an item to be moved from the ascendant. The superintendent will immediately take the change. And I'm assuming everybody read the bullet.

start time: 2207:11:40.000

confidence: 0.92

A: Yeah, you would.

C: Yes, yes. See, that's already. This is assuming that. This isn't assuming the exception that came in three days prior to.

E: Okay.

start time: 2214:17:54.000
end time: 2215:21:50.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Because that one I can definitely remove because it didn't have no business being there.

start time: 2215:36:10.000
end time: 2221:24:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So one thing is, you now are in our situation. Say if you had questions about an item on the consent agenda, a contract, you'd get the answer. You get the answer, but then you have to within a day, then ask to have it removed from the consent agenda.

start time: 2222:17:40.000
end time: 2222:34:00.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Good point.

start time: 2223:17:40.000
end time: 2223:40:40.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Say one more time.

start time: 2224:15:00.000
end time: 2227:52:22.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So it looks like based on this calendar that say you asked a question about a contract on the consent agenda, you. When you get the answer back, then you have one day to actually ask.

start time: 2227:52:46.000
end time: 2228:37:42.000
confidence: 0.88
E: To have a consent agenda based on the.

start time: 2228:39:26.000
end time: 2238:39:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: And I guess one question I have about the section generally is I understand the need to move items that are on the consent agenda to like have a vote on them. But sometimes you're removing something from the consent agenda because you're asking to have like a separate discussion about it, not. Not have a vote. It's a little. It's a little bit different. And I'm trying to think what we're trying to do here because, I mean, I think. I think if something gets recommended by the superintendent.

start time: 2239:16:40.000
end time: 2239:26:08.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Yeah.

start time: 2239:27:44.000
end time: 2242:18:36.000
confidence: 0.95
B: The past removing from the consent agenda actually just meant that you actually had a separate vote, but it wasn't actually removed from the agenda. It just was off the consent agenda because somebody didn't consent to.

start time: 2242:20:08.000
end time: 2251:16:14.000
confidence: 0.93
D: And the consent agenda you know, well, and that's what, that's, that's actually what this is. I mean, because I. Because to the larger point, I think the important thing, I mean, I think everyone knows consent agendas are intended to be unanimous consent. It's the reason why it's on there. They're non controversial, everyone's in favor of them, and you're going to get through 27 items really fast. That's the goal. Which is why any single board member has the power to remove it from the consent agenda. Not to stop a vote, but just to say I want a separate vote on that. Because that's not unanimous. Right. I want a chance to vote no. That's essentially why you're removing it. Right.

start time: 2251:17:42.000
end time: 2251:41:02.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Or speak to it or.

start time: 2251:42:46.000
end time: 2272:10:42.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Well, but so to that point though, because it does get confusing. I agree. In our script, it's a little bit weird and I wonder if there are ways to clarify that. If you just want to speak to it because you want to make a public point, but you still plan on voting yes, you can leave it on the consent agenda. And we do always have that in the script where it says, you know, is there any board discussion that would be the moment where board members say, oh yeah, on this contract, I just want to know this is X amount for this dollars, blah, blah, blah. You know, I'm still going to vote yes. I think that, you know, what we don't want is if there's an uncertainty at all and you're not sure, take it off. Right? That's the whole goal. Like, so if you have four days. And by the way, four days is important. I think three days if you need an extra day in there. The important thing though is if you're uncertain, take it off. Because you can still vote for it in the end. But where it gets weird is when people are trying to pull stuff off in the meeting. And obviously really blunt like, like, like I feel like we got a little sideways with the fact that you had objections to the contract, but because you had objections and pulled it off late, it's not that the rest of us got a chance to vote on it. It just got delayed to the next meeting. And that's what I thought was weird. I didn't have a problem. You had objections. I actually wanted to hear what those objections were. We didn't even really have a chance to like talk about it. It was just more. I don't think one board member should be able to delay a contract until the next pb.

start time: 2272:11:46.000
end time: 2272:34:56.000
confidence: 0.75
E: So that was awkward.

start time: 2272:35:38.000
end time: 2276:48:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: It was a little so the way this is written, let them know beforehand and if, if you don't let them know beforehand but a majority still wants it off, that's when it gets delayed to the next meeting. Right. So if something popped up a day before and all of a sudden four board members are like, I'm going to vote against this.

start time: 2276:54:20.000
end time: 2295:29:52.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I actually don't have because like frankly, you know, this is, this is about the grace. The two way grace is like I don't have an issue with somebody in a board meeting, say I want to take it off the consent agenda and have it on the regular agenda. But you still have a vote on it. It's not like delaying, like people are there coming so then about it. So I don't have a problem with it becoming off the consent agenda at the meeting. And sometimes like you may have heard like public comment or somebody may have, like the public doesn't, they don't follow. They don't, well they don't follow our timeline. So they may like, you know, hey, you know, Eddie, there's, you know, this issue on the consent agenda that, you know, X, Y and Z. And Eddie's like, oh, I didn't know that, but it happened like two days before. So to me the main principle is that you're not taking it off the agenda because you always have the opportunity to vote against it if it's a separate agenda item or if the majority wants to vote against it. Like, yeah, it's separate.

start time: 2295:32:16.000
end time: 2306:14:32.000
confidence: 0.94
D: I think, I think the reason why it's written as it is is to avoid surprises. Right. Age is very big on like going into your meeting, you should know exactly what's going to happen. There should be no gamesmanship, board members coming and pulling stuff. That said, I don't disagree, I don't disagree with you. I don't know what the superintendent or staff have thoughts on that. But for me, yeah, I mean I do, I do think it's a courtesy to say beforehand, if you know you want it off, let the chair know, let the superintendent know. But I agree with you. There may be something that you get an email that morning and you think, oh, this is worth a larger discussion. You know, is it worth just. It would be good to know what the question or concern might be so that staff can be prepared to speak to it.

start time: 2306:17:36.000
end time: 2308:12:24.000
confidence: 0.87
E: I mean, so is that implying that we will, if it's pulled off of the consent agenda, we still will be having a vote on it?

start time: 2308:15:12.000
end time: 2310:44:36.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Well, I think that's the courteous thing to do. And if there's four people who don't agree, then. Then they're voting down the one thing versus.

start time: 2310:46:28.000
end time: 2311:51:48.000
confidence: 0.84
D: Yeah. Or for people could table. You know, you don't have to vote down.

confidence: 0.94
B: Well, okay. Because you're not actually. You're not actually pulling it from. Well, it'll be obvious to everybody because. Okay, you're not pulling it because you're not gonna have a vote. It's just going to be a separate agenda. Items. Everybody will know.

start time: 2328:39:44.000
end time: 2329:16:56.000

D: Item four days before and I say, hey, I want this off consent, it would be nice for Roseanne to just, you know, email the board and say, hey, it's, you know, been a request to fill this item because that way you might not have focused on it. And you might be like, you know, maybe I want to spend a little time.

start time: 2333:23:36.000

confidence: 0.91
A: Let me try to see if I can. Heard everybody correct. Right. It sounds like we have a consensus to. If we move it within that four days, it will go. It just goes on the regular agenda. If someone removes it during the board meeting, it still goes to. They want to talk about it. You can go to the regular agenda.

start time: 2340:06:54.000

B: There's.

start time: 2340:12:14.000
end time: 2342:26:22.000
confidence: 0.90

end time: 2363:27:10.000
confidence: 0.91

end time: 2369:01:24.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I agree. It's a little. It's a little. I mean, the point they're trying to get at is that if there's something you are going to recuse yourself from. Not having to recuse yourself from the entire consent agenda, but still allowing intenders to go forward. But you can do that by just pulling the item. Yeah, you can just pull it for a separate vote. It's the same.

start time: 2369:02:52.000
end time: 2373:02:12.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Right. But this is like, I'm having to declare in writing as somebody who, like. And again, I always fall to. Fall on the side of, like, being cautious, like maybe the perception or we're gonna.

confidence: 0.93
D: So this is just about time. We have a lot more. I want to be clear. We can talk about some of it tonight. Short circle conversation. But Gary has asked me. Volun told me to be in charge. It helped shepherd the Superman's performance evaluation through this fall. And. And actually, I guess because. Yeah, because we do have new board members. So it is a new process for folks. The timeline that is in here now.

start time: 2385:21:04.000
end time: 2385:26:00.000

A: And.

start time: 2385:26:40.000
end time: 2422:04:04.000
confidence: 0.95
D: And I do have some questions. I actually think there's some. I have some concerns about the time. We'll talk about a second. We're going to do the study session with Dr. Adams on September 26th. And that's where we're going to receive the OSAs spring 2022 student performance data and outcomes. And the reason why that's important is because our. Our. Our evaluation template of the superintendent. That's. That's a really key part. And that we set targets and disaggregated targets for student learning and achievement. So we'll get that data and then these are not scheduled yet. The idea is, is we will need three executive sessions. We will need the first and we're going to talk about dates in a second. The first executive session where the superintendent will meet with us and present his self evaluation. So that's something that he's done, you know, in advance and sort of lays out. And actually I should take a step back because I got edit your new our evaluation template. We'll make sure. Well, you probably got a copy in your own materials, but we'll make sure all board members have it. We have student performance data as part of it. And then we have some leadership stances that are also. Student performance data is very quantitative. It will set targets. We're going to get that data. It's going to be plugged in. It's very formulaic. The leadership standards are obviously more qualitative. And so the superintendent's going to talk about how, you know, he thinks he succeeded in some areas and maybe needs to work on some others or maybe succeeded everywhere. And then we are, we're going to hear that in the first executive session. The second executive session will be to discuss and begin to outline our thoughts as a board. The board designee, which I think is me, will author, will take all that feedback from that second executive session, try and pull it together into an evaluation document that reflects everyone's feedback and then we come together for the executive session number three, where we provide the superintendent with that performance of evaluation and then we have to formally adopt it in a public boom. We do have all three executive sessions listed in October. I love the optimism. I think that's going to be challenging from a timing perspective. So, you know, I wonder if we can get the first two in October and scheduled deferred to early November. But maybe our chair wants us to really push for October, in which case I'll push as hard as we can.

confidence: 0.87
A: Well, the idea of that was to use, let's say those weekly executive sessions we will have and just kind of piggyback onto those. Do you remember it, Roland?

start time: 2427:44:50.000
end time: 2429:06:18.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Yeah. I mean, we want to hold exact executive sessions for you on several things.

start time: 2429:07:14.000
end time: 2429:52:10.000
confidence: 0.87
D: So those as well, you have two.

start time: 2429:52:50.000
end time: 2430:11:38.000
confidence: 0.99
B: A month already held.

start time: 2430:13:54.000
end time: 2433:18:02.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Right. So that's kind of the goal was to try to either use those and then piggyback off of those for those. So that way, because everybody's already, already there and that's why we kind of have all of them. But if you want to.

start time: 2433:21:06.000
end time: 2434:22:50.000
confidence: 0.94
D: No, I mean, I, I am all for moving promptly through the process. I also think it's really.

start time: 2434:23:30.000
end time: 2434:37:14.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I mean, this is, this is an.

start time: 2434:37:22.000
end time: 2441:46:20.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Important part of what the board does. I think we can also get really mired in it. I think it's important to keep it, you know, high level. You know, focus on student performance data, focus on leadership standards. You know, the hardest thing is, honestly. And it's, you know, I mean, the hardest thing is just getting to a place. We're not going to get to Unanimity, but getting to a place performance evaluation represents. And I think that that's really where the challenge comes in. So.

start time: 2441:55:30.000
end time: 2443:01:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Well, the other thing is we didn't actually do an evaluation last year.

start time: 2443:10:10.000
end time: 2443:32:26.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Well, we delayed the evaluation.

start time: 2443:34:18.000
end time: 2443:44:58.000
confidence: 0.79
E: Delayed it.

start time: 2443:45:54.000
end time: 2444:34:34.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Well, it's a two year valuation in essence then.

start time: 2444:36:02.000
end time: 2445:19:50.000
confidence: 0.98
D: That's right. Because the performance data wasn't available two months.

start time: 2445:38:10.000
end time: 2448:05:14.000
confidence: 0.91
E: This schedule feels very ambitious and I think that we're going to be very busy in October, other things. So.

start time: 2448:06:42.000
end time: 2448:38:02.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah, because I got a birthday in.

start time: 2448:38:26.000
end time: 2452:36:02.000
confidence: 0.88
A: October and I celebrate. I love that the superintendent T. That will be sending out to all the board members to look through and start.

start time: 2452:36:26.000
end time: 2453:51:10.000
confidence: 0.90
D: You and I can send it out right now. Yeah, well, actually.

start time: 2454:29:30.000
end time: 2454:40:34.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So you were going.

start time: 2454:40:42.000
end time: 2458:40:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: To say yes, so it would be great to just. Yes, we all have the, the, the, the one we adopted. So that's a good point. Conversation. So. No, the template shows what we evaluate him on, what we use. We can tell.

start time: 2458:57:40.000
end time: 2459:12:28.000
confidence: 0.87
A: We need to.

start time: 2459:14:44.000
end time: 2463:04:12.000
confidence: 0.90
D: Let me rephrase that. The quantitative section's already laid out what we do for the qualitative section or leadership standards. I think we should have a discussion. People are not too tired. We can have a finite discussion before.

start time: 2463:04:36.000
end time: 2467:17:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: We move off of quantitative. Is it possible. I have the evaluation, but the 2022 baseline data is not dropped in there. It would be great to have that before we start the process. Not this year, but the 2022.

start time: 2467:24:50.000
end time: 2468:16:58.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Is 2022 serving as a baseline.

start time: 2468:19:54.000
end time: 2468:34:30.000
confidence: 0.82
B: That's what.

start time: 2469:06:10.000
end time: 2469:18:30.000
confidence: 0.55
D: Years.

start time: 2469:28:50.000
end time: 2470:28:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I mean, we have it. It just needs to be dropped in so that we're.

start time: 2470:47:30.000
end time: 2471:23:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Do you want that in advance of the 26?

start time: 2471:28:50.000
end time: 2472:55:54.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Well, we have it. So it seems like it would be useful to know what our starting.

start time: 2472:58:02.000
end time: 2474:35:50.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Our starting point is versus 26. You'll get 22 and the latest all in one.

start time: 2475:04:50.000
end time: 2475:52:58.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So I'm just curious. We have it. Can we just.

start time: 2475:53:54.000
end time: 2476:35:50.000
confidence: 0.68
D: Sure. Last year's now.

start time: 2477:12:50.000
end time: 2482:02:20.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Well, again, since we didn't have my perspective, we didn't have a evaluation process get delayed or we didn't have an annual evaluation and it's a two year appreciate having 22 data and dropped into the form.

start time: 2483:34:00.000
end time: 2493:13:40.000
confidence: 0.94
D: And so then the question is on the leadership standards. Well, I guess it would open up. I done this a number of different ways. Again, I think it's better. I think it's better. We've had, we've had. We've had templates where board members have written a lot. We've had years where they've written. I'm a big fan of sort of hitting the high level notes and like for each leadership standard, maybe every board member includes 3 to 5 bullets of things that they, you know either again, you know, it's like any performance valuation. You want to talk about the things that went well. You want to talk about areas where you might want to see some.

start time: 2493:45:40.000
end time: 2496:08:00.000
confidence: 0.91
E: Not long paragraph, not long monologues. Agreed.

start time: 2497:01:40.000
end time: 2498:18:00.000
confidence: 0.97
B: You could do a character just saying.

start time: 2498:24:20.000
end time: 2498:53:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Tricky. Yeah.

start time: 2499:05:40.000
end time: 2502:13:06.000
confidence: 0.93
D: So maybe, yeah if the board's okay with that, we can take those quality of leadership standards and just create. Now I'm trying to remember maybe there already is space in there for board member feedback, but I'm not sure. We didn't create.

start time: 2502:14:18.000
end time: 2502:29:22.000
confidence: 0.90
E: I think there is.

start time: 2502:31:06.000
end time: 2502:47:10.000
confidence: 0.86
A: Is there any.

start time: 2503:13:30.000
end time: 2504:19:10.000
confidence: 0.97
D: But that's all going to happen after the 26th. So nothing for the next month.

start time: 2505:30:50.000
end time: 2506:28:30.000
confidence: 0.94
G: Is this, this is the evaluation that's also going to be public.

start time: 2506:44:10.000
end time: 2535:58:16.000
confidence: 0.95
D: So yeah. And you know, it's a great question. Generally speaking, the evaluation document, the conversation we have with the superintendent is executive session. So it's not public conversation. The any documents written documents we create are. Portland Public Schools is as far as we can tell, the only district that the media often asks for. Every other district creates these performance valuations. Already asked for them here. And to be really just say it. I'll say it publicly in case anybody wants to call me on it. It creates a real disincentive to honest conversation. I remember my very first evaluation shortly after I got on the board, you know, was generally very positive. Said a lot of really positive things about the superintendent in there was a couple sentences about, you know, you know, the board has asked the superintendent to improve some communication about different things. And the Oregonian headline was Board Slam Superintendent on Communication Vacations. And if you read that evaluation, that was just false. I mean I don't usually use the term fake news, but it was a hundred percent false. But that's what got a headline and it's what sold, you know, some subscriptions and papers. And so it creates a real challenge for us. Like when I have my performance values by employees, I don't have them in front of 100 people, right. I have them with one person. And so that is our challenge is, you know, we want to have really honest, open feedback with the superintendent. He wants to have really honest, open feedback with us. Again, this is a two way evaluation. We're evaluating his performance. But as our employee, he's also telling us what he needs from us. Right. He's also telling us, has he gotten what he needs from the board? Has he gotten the support? Has he gotten, you know, all these different things? Those conversations are really important, but the more public they become, the more fraught they are.

start time: 2535:59:28.000
end time: 2539:11:52.000
confidence: 0.93
G: So anyway, like, I guess my question is there. So I mean, if I'm writing an evaluation for you, I know Director Scott's going to read it. Who am I writing it for? Like, exactly what you said, right?

start time: 2539:12:16.000
end time: 2539:38:48.000
confidence: 0.88
D: Like the audience. Right.

start time: 2539:39:44.000
end time: 2541:54:50.000
confidence: 0.95
G: And so I mean, like, I know as a educator that when we do performance evaluations, this is private stuff, because then I can be honest. Right.

start time: 2541:55:30.000
end time: 2542:09:30.000
confidence: 0.98
D: It's a growth thing.

start time: 2542:10:10.000
end time: 2548:45:40.000
confidence: 0.93
G: And if we're, we're looking at evaluation as something for, to spur growth, I mean, what are there other. Is there another way around? Like, do we do most of our real evaluation in the executive session and then just what we write on paper we know is going to go out there and write something more? Summer tip, right. Or summative.

start time: 2549:08:40.000
end time: 2551:39:40.000
confidence: 0.83
D: Yeah, summative. Publicly evaluation state that. I know, I don't know, another employee ends up on the front page of the review.

start time: 2551:48:40.000
end time: 2553:11:12.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So, you know, or to give me the, you know, the appraisal that it.

start time: 2553:11:36.000
end time: 2565:19:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Thinks that, you know, I warrant. And I also have to weigh my professional reputation, you know, being on the front page of the newspaper too, every time. One of the things we talked about a few years ago didn't quite adopt was, you know, we could in theory just have quantitative data for the performance evaluation that's public, Right. Which is our performance data. And we could set the targets and say, hey, did we achieve those targets or not? And the qualitative stuff could be verbal, right. We could have that conversation, you know, you know, in executive session and talk about the qualitative issues. When we suggested that, I don't know, four or five years ago, you know, enough board members kind of said, now we think the leadership standards are important, we want to have something. And so that's where we are. But again, we get to decide what that performance evaluation.

start time: 2565:36:10.000
end time: 2567:53:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: I'm going to suggest that we actually move the final evaluation to the finalizing and the board vote.

start time: 2568:12:10.000
end time: 2570:31:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: My question was, that's one of my questions because of the things that we about to go through.

start time: 2571:21:40.000
end time: 2576:46:30.000
confidence: 0.92
B: I think you just move it to November and that'd be a good time to have. Yeah, if it's still within what we're required to do by the superintendent's contract. But I would highly recommend included in October.

start time: 2576:47:50.000
end time: 2577:24:50.000
confidence: 0.87
D: Yeah, I have no objection to that.

start time: 2577:56:30.000
end time: 2579:03:18.000
confidence: 0.92
A: All right. Anything else for the good of November?

start time: 2579:03:34.000
end time: 2580:14:10.000
confidence: 0.94
D: If you have feedback records, only a phone call away.

start time: 2580:32:30.000
end time: 2582:01:30.000
confidence: 0.71
C: I'm definitely. I said I live in the exposure.

start time: 2583:04:30.000
end time: 2583:30:50.000
confidence: 0.83
E: Completion in the vote.

start time: 2584:16:20.000
end time: 2584:44:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Anything else? Good for the order.
