Good evening and welcome everyone. Tonight we are doing something new. We're going to have a new meeting format and tonight meeting we will be doing a few things that I try to explain as we go. Some of the changes and why those changes were or are as we go through the night. All right, so we're going to get started. We will hear from a report from our superintendent.

B: Well, good evening directors as I have a few images and slides for you. But I'm going to focus my superintendent's report on a little bit of a summer wrap up because it's been a busy time even with school out. We have had a lot of children, young adults and educators who have been engaged in a lot of extended learning opportunity, some academics, some enrichment. So I just want to give you a quick overview of what that is. And it isn't just the students. We also have a number of our educators who have also been engage in some professional learning activities. So this is just a quick picture here on the COVID Thank you to our board directors who have gotten around throughout the course of the summer at various events where our families and our students have been engaged. This is at the Summer Arts Academy showcase this past Friday evening. Thank you directors student rep for being there to celebrate our students who after a very short stint of classes put on a short showcase of visual and performing arts. And it was a packed auditorium. So thank you to all our family members who were there. So like I said, focusing on summer clicker. No, you want to advance it manually. Perfect. You can go to the next one. I'm going to start with our summer acceleration academy. We spent quite a few evenings talking about. Go back one more. Talking about our preparations to offer students an opportunity to extend their learning. This summer proudly we offered our acceleration academy at 17 hub sites. Over 2,500 students received academic supports and smaller class sizes for four weeks of instruction. We also our educators also engaged in five days of professional learning given that the lessons and the learning there were strategically prepared for them. So I just a big shout out to our educators who worked those four weeks to make sure that our students were able to participate in our acceleration academy. And I know many directors got around to check out one of those hub sites. I had the opportunity to do so as well. It was really exciting to see both students and teachers excited to engage in learning this summer and talking about how much they've enjoyed it and how much they hope that they get to do it again next year. Now there was the acceleration Academy that took place in these hub sites, but it also comprised a few other components. And again, this was us trying to be responsive to what we were hearing from families. We also had a strand of newcomers program which were staffed by an ELD teacher for our newcomers to give them a little bit of a leg up. It was wonderful to be at McDaniel and be in a class to hear so many accents. We had Russian students, Afghani students, Latino students, all in the same room, learning together, really getting along, having a great time on their language development as emergent bilinguals. That was really fun. We also staff set up a soaring readers program. There was concerns about students who were really requiring some additional instructional specialist support on their reading needs, so they were able to receive those services as well at our hub sites. And then we didn't forget our youngest students. We want to make sure all of our students are K ready when they enter school. So our early kindergarten transition program was able to take place as well too. So that was another way we were able to serve our students. Next slide. You heard a little bit about our arts academy already from me. I just want to emphasize for the just under 150 students that participated, they were from 16 different schools across the district. It was a wonderful diversity that was there. I want to really highlight that the summer arts academy was an inclusive experience. Almost a quarter of the students that were enrolled have IEPs or receive special education services during the course of the year. And there was a theme of our arts academy that they adopted together. We are brilliant. So I just want to appreciate how they recognize the talents and brilliance of every one of our students as they implement that program. We've been running the Arts Academy for several summers now and it's really one of our jewels of summer experience. Some other summer enrichment. As you know, we also worked with 26 community based organizations, many culturally specific organizations, as well as with Multnomah County Sun Services. So there was also a whole array of programming that was happening in either half day afternoons to complement our morning acceleration academy programming, or they were offering some full day programming at various sites. Some of these are still going strong until August 30th, so up until the start of school. So please know that they're also serving 1700 students. So that's a good contingent of students that are participating in an array of programming there. A lot of it focused on cultural identity and development, some STEM STEAM opportunities, some employment opportunities, some athletics opportunities, and then a shout out to our partners at Multnomah county sun programs who also helped several hundred students at our acceleration website hub sites. I won't go too much into this, but it wasn't just the children. It was also the educators and our school leaders who've been involved in a whole array of programming this summer. Dr. Proctor is going to talk about that in our back to school preparations, but I'll just say at the end of June when school got out, we had 600 educators in our summer institute. We're going to have another batch of 900 and then we're going to fill up the convention center with another thousand educators on August 24th. So just know that there is a lot of educator professional development occurring. So it wasn't just our students and our educators. Just shout out. Our school board also engaged in their own summer learning. Thank you to our directors for making the trek to Boston and participating in some cases the second time in a collaboration between the Council Great City School and the Harvard Business School and Graduate School of Education. Spending four days talking with and collaborating with board members from around the country on governance. I think the feedback was positive and I hope you enjoyed it and I know I learned a lot being there with you as well. There's this emerging theme that's coming out of a lot of these gatherings. This notion of our collective efficacy, that one team, one goal. And just to borrow from the Arts Academy theme around, when we are together, you know, brilliant things can happen. Well, we're really happy about those that are joining Team PPS in a few different capacities. I want to welcome our principals. We welcome them back this week. In fact, on Monday this morning they got a shout out. We have about 18, 19 new principals, some returning to the principalship, but most of them in their first year as principals. So they're spending this week at our Leadership Institute really getting up to speed and preparing to be in place. Also we have an array of APs and VPs either moving locations or starting new as experienced teacher leaders in AP or VP roles. We have about 11 persons taking on that administrative role. So just a big welcome to a lot of our principals. Many of them are being promoted up from AP Ships. Some of them are coming from surrounding neighboring districts who want to join Team pps. So we welcome all of them to their new roles. And it's not just principals. We also have some central office folks leaders who've been identified. You've been getting those leadership announcements. You can find these all on our website. We're welcoming some of our experienced principals into some senior director roles to help support school communities across the district. I think you'll recognize many of these folks who are taking on some important roles. Anything from supporting our secondary schools and academics to serving as principal supervisors with a cohort of schools. They're getting to know their principals this week. They're doing a lot of cohort time and talking about the work ahead. I also want to point out Director has received a note from me recently. I'm welcoming an interim Deputy superintendent for Business and Ops for a long time vacant position. It's hard to imagine going another year without some added capacity there. So you'll get to meet him as soon as he lands. Actually he's driving up right now. He'll be here tomorrow to start his first day. Myung Lee, who recently retired from the San Francisco Unified School District and just in full transparency, my former work partner in our district there. So we're drafting him out of retirement to lend a hand while we identify a permanent deputy superintendent moving forward. So excited to welcome Yong in the coming days. Just some upcoming events I want to make mention of so that folks can get the word out and hopefully participate. As you know, we do our annual Community Care Day. This is an opportunity to support our school communities. Spruce up our schools. We have a couple of Saturdays identified August 12th and August 19th. It's just a couple of hours. We're hoping folks can volunteer. As you can see, Director DePass and I were at Boise I think it was last year. You can find a listing of all the schools that are hoping for some help. It might be spreading a little mulch around, maybe chopping down some weeds and doing a little beautification of our school communities so our schools look spiffy when students show up on the first day of school. And I want this is another important event. I want to make sure it's on people's calendars. Many of our students have been working really hard this summer to finish up their graduation requirements. So we're going to have our culminating all district Summer graduation on September 7th at 8:00 being hosted at Lincoln High School. So we'll have students there and they're cap and gowns from their various high schools. It's a beautiful event. I hope our directors can join us there. And I think that's it. But that's not all the work that's been happening this summer. You're going to hear a little bit more on the back to school preparations, Because I didn't dive into all the facilities work that's been happening this summer. The team has been super busy on not just construction projects, a lot of deferred maintenance that, you know, we're tackling and chipping away at. So you'll hear a little bit more about that a bit later in the program. And that's my report for this evening. Chair.

A: Thank you for that. So next we're going to go to our student representative report, if she has one. And this is something that we had did last year, Some changes we made last year. Chair Scott at the time and listen to our student rep wanted to make sure she's heard when we have a crowd. So here you go. You inherited this one.

C: Thank you. Well, honestly, mine was kind of similar to the superintendent's, so I can just skip over some parts of this, I guess. So again, I was just talking about how we're lucky enough to have several summer programs. I was given the opportunity to tour our Vietnamese dual language immersion summer camp. I'm gonna try and pronounce this correctly. I'm so sorry if I don't. Jai hay. And I truly think that our immersion programs are part of what makes us special. The kids there just look so, so happy. They were creating beautiful art. I heard from a lot of people that they were making a lot of new friendships. And it's not only serving the students who attend, but also the high schoolers who are serving in sort of a counselor capacity. And then I was also, as we saw in that photo, able to attend the summer arts academy showcase. And wow. I think we already knew how talented our students were, but this just proved it. Visual and performing arts. Amazing. And I wanted to highlight, one of my friends actually helped teach part of the dance program. And she just talked about how amazing her kids were over and over. So that's really exciting. And then also, I want to expand a little bit on how you mentioned SUN programming. I know at Franklin, which is where I go, love, love are the people who work in the SUN department. And this summer they were working on a lot of, like, adulting workshops. So students have really been learning life skills. And again, I think just that all of our summer programs are so important. And I'm really excited that PPS continues to fund these because I think just all across the board, these are amazing opportunities. And then kind of looking to the school year, because that's coming up very quickly. I'm not gonna lie. There are a lot of contentious topics that are going to be on the table as we move throughout the year. But I want to emphasize that we all share the same goal of serving our students as best we can. And so I want to go into the school year with gratitude because I think it's really important to constantly work towards improvement, but we should take some time to acknowledge how far we've come. So thank you to the students who showed up during their summers for participating in or helping to run programs. Thank you to the educators who showed up during their summers as well and who truly are the backbone of pps. Thank you to the custodians. Custodians who keep the schools open and running so we can host these programs. Thank you to the PPS staff who have done things like facilitate the grants and funding for these programs or are working in an administrative capacity. And if you are involved in PPS's summer programming in any way, thank you. You deserve some applause.

A: All right. Thank you. I'm going to change the little name the student director. So now next we have. And this is where we kind of changed up some stuff I wanted to, and it's something that we had talked about last year is want to make sure that we hear from our students. And knowing the fact that they got clothes, class and stuff in the mornings and stuff, we actually going to do two things different. We're going to move student comments right after the student director comment. So we're going to move student comments here. So it's going to be at this time, we're going to hear from students. Then we're going to get into some of our resolutions and then we'll get into general comments. And that's kind of a little different from this year. But we wanted to make sure that we got our students first and center, then really wanted to hear from them. So I'm asking Bradshaw, do we have any students signed up for public comments today?

A: Okay. Plan is they. They. Not they. They're coming. They just. Summer. Summer break. Summer break. All right. So we don't have to go through that. So next we can go to some of our resolutions. So next, let me share. So next we will vote on the intergovernmental agreement for TriMet youth passes. Typically, this would this item and one of the following would be included in this Guy Consent agenda. But we wanted to see how this new format works, so I took it off the consent agenda and brought it here. So I want to see how the flow and stuff works with this new run of show that we have. So I'm gonna ask, do we have a motion and a second to adopt resolution 6739, expenditure contract? Hold on, hold on. Let me finish saying the whole thing. Expenditure contracts that exceeds 153 for delegation of authority for Trimet youth passes.

A: All right, so we have Director Bermet W.S. and Director Depas. Seconds. Is there any board discussion?

start time: 300:09:20.000
end time: 304:10:00.000
confidence: 0.95
E: No, just that it's a great program. Very happy to support it. I think we've been doing this since 2009 and is one way we can demonstrate our love for all of our students by offering. Offering them bus passes. Free bus passes.

start time: 304:38:20.000
end time: 323:01:06.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Awesome. Any other board discussion, Ms. Bradshaw? Is there any public comment? No. All right. And so this is something a little different, too. I heard from, you know, some concern constituents around the voting and what. What things mean. So. Well, one thing that we're going to do this year is we're going to let public know what a yes vote means and what a no votes mean, and then we'll go ahead and vote. So just to be clear, by voting yes on the resolution to approve this intergovernmental agreement with TriMet, this will provide all high school students this upcoming school year with the ability to use public transit at no cost to them. By voting no on this resolution means all high schoolers are on the bus on their own dime. But it essentially means they will not have access to free transit on TriMet. So the board will now vote on resolution 6739, expenditure contracts that exceeds 150,000 for a delegation of authority for TriMet youth passes. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes.

confidence: 0.96
D: And Director Hollins, just to clarify is that the state pays for a portion of that because they reimburse for part of our transportation. So just to clarify, it's not just free because the district's going to pay the whole bill, but we get a split share from the. From the state.

end time: 350:43:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Just want to be clear because people like might wonder. We're one of the few districts that doesn't offer yellow buses for our high school students because we have a great transit system.

start time: 351:00:00.000
end time: 373:15:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: All right. All right. So the next up next is the resolution to request approval from PPS board for one capital improvement project from one of our CBO schools. Please note, this is not a request for new funds as ESSER funds have already been approved for this individual ESSER allotment and have been awarded to each of the contracted alternative schools as part of the 2021-22 budget process. As however, there is now a state requirement that school board approve request requesting using ESSER fund for capital projects. This is another one that was actually on the consent agenda. And I just brought over to see how this. How it's going to run with this new format. So if we vote yes, then Helen's View can move forward with using already approved funds to lease space in order to provide counseling and recovery services to students in a space that is intentionally separate from Helen's view for the purpose of confidentiality. If we vote no, then Helen View cannot move forward with the providing these services in a confidential space. Do I have a motion and second, to adopt resolution 6743 resolution approving capital projects for contracted alternative schools using Esser 2 and Esser 3 funds.

A: All right. No extensions. Motion passes. Seven zero. All right, so that's the section that we will be doing. Resolutions. One of the goals of us doing that is we wanted the Community to be part of these decision making processes as well. And so that's why we are breaking up students comments and then general public comments with this new run of show. If there's any questions or ideas, we can please submit those to our let's talk or you can email me directly let me know what you guys think about the new format. All right, so next we turn to public comments. Before we begin, I would like to review our guideline for public comments. First, the board thanks you for taking time to attend this meeting and providing your comments. Public input informs and improves our work and we look forward to hearing your thoughts and reflections. Our board office may follow up on board related issues raised during public testimony. We request that complaints about individual employees be directed to the superintendent office as a personal matter. Personnel matter. If you have additional materials or items you would like to provide to the board or the superintendent, we ask that you email them to public comment all in one wordps.net public commentsps.net please make sure when you begin your comments that you clearly state your name and spell your last name. So we're going to do a little bit differently with these comments today. And moving forward, you will have 3 minutes and 30 seconds to speak. So we're going to actually allow more time to speak. You will hear a sound after three minutes and 30 seconds, which means it's time. After three minutes you hear time. That means you got 30 seconds left. Please adhere to that because after three minutes and 30 seconds the mic will go off. All right, so just make sure we're clear. And I want to make sure that as we enter this year that we really make sure we are respectful, that we are really listening to hear. Because a lot of times when it gets too rowdy, I can't focus on the actions or the things that even you guys are talking about because it's all this, all the stuff that comes at us. So I'll just ask that please make public comments, bring your comments to us, email, whatever, but please try to, you know, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it level so that way, you know, we can hear and. Because I really want to hear your guys and what you say, but when I'm hearing people talking at us and stuff, I no longer hear it. And, and I think that's not what you guys really intend. I think your intention is for us to hear you. So I want to make sure we do that. All right, so we'll get moving, Ms. Bradshaw. Oh, and then another thing too. We're going to invite all four people up to talk at the same time and then you go one by one just so we can really be efficient with our board meetings as well. All right, Ms. Bradshaw, do we have anyone signed up for public comments?

B: Thank you. My name is Ryan Healy. H E A L Y. And thank you for the opportunity to speak to you this evening. I'm an electrician in the facilities maintenance department at PPS. PPS maintains about 9 million square feet spread out across 177 buildings. Our buildings are up to 120 years old, but even the newest schools have immediately required repair work from the PPS maintenance department. According to a report the district commission from engineering Firm CEZANN Group, 56% of these facilities are in poor condition. Based on their facility condition assessment, only 20% qualified as good at our current level of maintenance staffing. This is only becoming worse. This is why it's imperative to attract and retain the best employees. When the electrical department was fully staffed, it works out to about 20 buildings per electrician. We're kept constantly busy making repairs to the unique and antiquated systems within these buildings and learning new systems with every new school. Additionally, we've documented numerous hours making corrections to work by outside contractors, as is the case for other departments in maintenance. This is skilled work. We're not just installers, but specialized service department working in attics, crawl spaces around asbestos and other hazards. Despite this, we're the lowest paid general journeyman electricians in the union. About $18 per hour difference with a service electrician at a private company. The benefits PPS offers don't make up that difference, which has been steadily growing over the years. Within the last few years, we lost nearly half our electricians as they left to take advantage of better compensation elsewhere. The district can't rely on downturns in construction to fill these positions. We need people to stay when things pick up again. We can't afford to lose skilled workers who take years to train. We're at a turning point of a crisis in the district's ability to maintain its assets. So why are we still here? Because we care about the work we do. This is true for us in maintenance. True for teachers, nutrition workers, custodians, support staff, all of us who make these schools work. But we're falling behind in our ability to care for the schools. We don't have the staff resources to do preventative maintenance. We can only respond once things break and become unsafe. Replacing equipment that could have been kept in good condition is not a sustainable plan. It just wastes money and puts people at risk. The district can spend a little more to keep things running safely or a lot more when emergencies happen and there's no one on hand with the skills and experience to fix it. This is on report showed of the 73 full time positions across the crafts and maintenance, only 56 were filled. Additionally, it recommends the district add another 40 full time positions. The decision was made years ago to defer costs by reducing maintenance staffing and now the bill's coming due. Outsourcing. This work costs more up front and it costs again when we and maintenance return to make corrections. The district owes its dedicated employees appreciation and compensation. It owes taxpayers to protect the investments that they've spent their hard work, hard earned money on. And the district owes our children who are students here to help us provide the safe and functional places to learn that they deserve. Thank you.

C: Okay. Hello. My name is Devin Gani. G H A N I. I spoke to the board on March 7 about safety for both staff and students. I'm here to talk to you about that again, but in a different way. I'm a therapeutic intervention coach at the Pioneer Special School program. Special ed program. Part of my job as a TIC is to respond to student crisis. Please keep that in mind when I explain what my experience has been as a TIC at Pioneer. I see your face. Yeah, I'm going to try to keep it together. I've been inspired by Malik Elker's powerful statement last board meeting. She brought together a community of people who are experiencing exactly the same thing and felt that no one was paying attention and taking our concerns seriously. Everything that I'm about to tell you has been reported to hr. I was told there was insufficient evidence of my claims even though one of my claims happened on camera. A warning. These things are somewhat graphic. These comments that have been said to me. So anyone watching or listening, I want to give you a moment to not listen. If this could be upsetting to you. A few comments that were said to me. Starting from the first few months I became a therapeutic intervention coach. A co worker. Another coach asked me to rate the female coworkers I worked with who had the top five best bodies. He asked me to rate my female coworkers after another coach and I were in a restraint with a student at transport, which means we were physically moving the child from one part of the room to another. He came up to me and said, I have to tell you that it was a turn on to see you two doing that restraint. He said that to me while the student was in the room. Another comment. The same co worker said to me, he walked into the room while I was bending over to stretch. I was stretching because I was in pain following a physical restraint that was difficult. I stood up, saw him come in the room. He said to me, it's really impressive and sexy that you can do that. Implying bending over and stretching to my toes. He tried to pat me on the shoulder. When I showed disgust, I moved away from him and walked out of the room. He didn't know if there was a student in the room at the time or not. He walked in the door and said that to me without even looking. There could have been a student there. That happened on camera. The impact of working in this environment, I think, is what matters. It's not the only place I've been harassed, the only workplace I've been harassed. That's very common for women. But like I said, this job is a crisis intervention job. These students rely on me being able to emotionally manage anything that's going on for me so that I can be there for them. I am highly skilled at this. It's why I was able to walk away from that coach after he said those disgusting things to me every single time and respond to student crisis if needed. I had to hold it down. I had to pull it together, right, Because I'm a professional. I also started wearing shirts around my waist after the first few comments he made to me in the fall of 2022. I told him to not make these comments. He knew I was uncomfortable. I tie these shirts around my waist not because it matters what I'm wearing, because I wanted another layer between me and him. He is not the only person who made comment to me. I reported several people to hr. I don't know what else to do. It's been reported. I've been basically told there's not enough evidence. So you tell me, how do I trust this employer? How do I go back to school and know that I will be safe and the students that I serve will be safe because what my experience and my work environment is their learning environment. And I know for a fact that there are students who were experiencing things like this as well at school and they have come forward as well. The time is now to take action. The time is now for an independent audit of the people doing these Investigations and making these decisions. You know who I'm talking about. Thank you for your time. If you have questions, I'm an open book, as you can tell.

F: That'S kind of tough to follow. Can I let that kind of sink in a little bit before I actually get my time started? Because what I'm about to present is like totally different, so. But I just wanted to let that kind of like, you know, sink in for a little bit.

F: All right. For the record, my name is Karanja Cruz. I'm a longtime educator, wanted to introduce myself to the new board members. I've been advocating for young people for a very long time. I'm the founder of the Teaching With Purpose Conference, which is an annual conference that brings over 500 to 600 educators across the state to teach them about culturally relevant pedagogy. Yeah, thank you for that. PBS is a longtime sponsor. We appreciate them sponsoring. This year we're going to be at Lincoln High School. So we're excited about that. Our keynote speaker is going to be Dr. Angela Davis. Yes. Yeah, give it up for that. So I'm here to present a legislative concept to change the way we do assessment. It's been a long lasting achievement gap, but we never looked at actually how we look at assessing our young people. So I wanted to give you guys some information about the new ESSA law that Obama passed that gives every state an opportunity to change the way we actually do standardized assessment. I wanted to present to you all that I'm going to be pushing legislation to change the accountability indicator that we have to report to the federal government. So as of now, we have to report on the result of the essa. Excuse me, sbac, which is now the Oregon Assessment System. But I am pushing for more of the local performance assessments, which is a different type of assessment. It's more of a performance base and it's more of an interaction with students. It's a back and forth where students can actually see the target and they can strive for the target. So what I've done for you on the back of the legislative concept sheet, I broke down the different types of assessment. So currently we are being assessed on a criteria reference test that is the new sbacc. We spend a million dollars on the MAPS assessment, which is a norm reference assessment. So that's like comparing apples and Oregons. I'm pushing for the performance based assessment which currently PPS is not in compliance. And I'm still waiting for a corrective action plan of how we're going to implement local performance assessments. So that is my time. I just wanted to present that information to you. If you have any questions, please let me know. I would love to sit down with you to talk more in depth about these different assessment approaches. Again, I just want to kind of give you the knowledge of the way we assess and how the sbac, the organ assessment system, is a criteria based and MAPS is a norm reference test which is comparing apples and oranges and that we should focus more on the local performance assessments.

start time: 671:45:28.000
end time: 675:51:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Mr. Cruz, I'm so sorry, I was having a hard time. I wanted to ask permission to ask the question. But changing the type of assessment we do, what are the expected. What would we expect to see with your proposed assessment versus what we're doing currently?

start time: 676:04:50.000
end time: 686:25:20.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Are you talking about from a state level or for a local. The local level for MAPS assessment. So we changed the emphasis and the focus on MAPS assessment. If we focus more on the local performance assessment, what that does is it just provides more of a teaching learning experience. Right, so you're providing. So if you look at the information, it breaks down what a performance assessment is. So again, that's more portfolio based. It's more of students seeing a target. It's more problem solving. It's more critical thinking, actually, which is missing in our curriculum right now.

start time: 689:45:32.000
end time: 690:23:10.000
confidence: 0.93
F: So as I stated before, there's.

E: And I'll read this. I don't have time to read it.

start time: 690:55:46.000
end time: 712:28:20.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Yeah, no, no problem. So there's a misalignment. So I've been, I've been talking about this for a while, for some years, how we have our report cards, right? The report, the. The way we report on our report cards is not aligned with what is actually being assessed in maps and what is being assessed with the S back. Even though we say it's the state standards, it's the Common Core standards, but the Common Core standards is. It's like a big ocean and you have to narrow down to like different rivers, right? So what's happening is that we're just, we're being swallowed by the ocean and we, we don't really have key targets that is really happening where we can really help our kids raise achievement. So, for example, you guys are going to see very bad results for the. The s back this. I'm telling you that now. I don't even know. I haven't seen the results, but I'm pretty sure you're not going to see good results. Uh, oh, so. And I think that's kind of unfair to measure someone based around standardized tests, for example. So, you know, I think we just need to reevaluate how we look at assessments and how we hold certain people accountable on a standardized test. Again, like we're. We're judging someone from an ocean, but we're not focusing on the. On the river that leads to the ocean.

A: All right, thanks, everyone for being brave to come up and talk their truth. We really appreciate everyone speaking and we want to make sure that everybody knows. If you have any other issues or comments, feel free to connect with our board manager, Roseanne Powell. She's sitting over there. If you have something specifically you want to follow up on with the board or the board office. So we have two. Next, we have two things that the superintendent is going to introduce or talk about. One is going to be the Update to the 202324 school year budget and state school fund and also Preparing for the 2324 school year. So, Superintendent, we'd like to introduce these next couple items.

start time: 733:59:50.000
end time: 761:48:54.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Yes. Thank you, Chair Hollins. Both important topics. At the last meeting, you'll recall, we shared with the board that we would be coming back seeking a budget amendment once we learned what our final budget allocation would be. Our initial proposed timeline suggested that the board would hear us out and would vote on a budget amendment during the meeting on August 22nd. And we're having to sort of make some adjustments in when we bring our recommendation or amendment to you because we won't have the complete information from the state and some of it won't even be allocated until later in the fall. So we're planning to come back to you as early as possible in October for approval. And this change is mainly based on recent state information received on August 1st. That also gives time to staff to prepare materials that are required to be submitted to ode. It gives staff a little more time to have thoughtful conversations with our cbrc, for instance, without feeling a rush around proposed amendments, which I know is also important to the board. So you're going to hear some of the details and what we're learning so far regarding an update on revenue adjustments for the year. So here to provide you some high level information on ways that we are beginning to think about. Again, this has been iterative. We've continued to come back to the board and how we may invest additional funds. So here to talk about that is our chief of staff, Jonathan Garcia.

start time: 761:51:02.000
end time: 814:15:00.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Thank you Superintendent. And you highlighted I think the highlight of this message. So I know we have about five minutes so I'll try to do this in two to give you time for some questions. Next slide. The last board meeting we updated you that we had received an additional $15.1 million as a result of the state school fund increase. We did get more details since that meeting, particularly the new REC allocation for early literacy. So we are receiving $3.2 million for this upcoming school year. In addition, we did get an update on our integrated grant which includes our student investment account and our high school Success or Measure 98. And as you can see on this slide, we did get an increase of $6.6 million from the student investment account and we are seeing a decrease from high school student success. As a reminder, most of these dollars, whether student investment accounts or Measure 98s, come from some level of corporate tax. So things shift year to year. Next slide. These are some of the emergent details that we provided you, whether regarding general fund early literacy or the integrated grant we are looking to, we are working on, we're waiting for further details from the state in terms of what the application details will entail, what what our requirements are and we expect those to be released on October 1st. Some of the emerging investment areas you can see here include reading intervention specialists, summer learning, acceleration, expanded science of reading resources, and we also have more information coming to us regarding our integrated grants. So we expect to receive an amendment to our proposal or we need to submit an amendment to our proposal which is due on October 31st. And so some of the emerging investment areas with that 6.6 million is to lessen the impact of the student high school success funding decrease in addition to building out some school based coordinators to address student out of school learning barriers, summer programming, comprehensive school psychologists, which is something I know we've heard a lot of from from our community and you, the board and additional instructional specialists. Next slide. And so again as the superintendent laid out, here are some next steps. We're continuing to wait for future or for more information to make our final recommendation to the school board in hopes of you voting on this in October. We we are working with the CBRC and looking to schedule the meeting with the CBRC sometime in mid September to review our recommendations and gives us enough time to really think about their recommendations, both their existing recommendations from the spring and future recommendations that come from our proposal. And again as always, we will continue to provide you regular updates as we learn more from the state State.

D: Comment. Thank you for the presentation. I'm glad to see in the integrated grant the summer programming for 2024 just as a continued work by the district to provide additional supports for students who were impacted, all our students who were impacted during the pandemic just to continue that on. And a question about the school psychologist if just the timing of that after in October. So is that we'd wait till October and then bring them on or before because waiting till October doesn't seem like the optimal time. It seems better to have it start with the school year. If we know that we'll have funding coming in or some level of it.

start time: 834:07:00.000
end time: 843:59:10.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah. So we we've met as a team, as a senior leadership team and begin to really sketch this out. Understanding that school starts in a few weeks. So we want to make sure that we are moving forward with hiring some of these because I think we've heard collectively from the board a desire to move in that direction. So we are making a big bet, if you will, Director Brim Edwards that that this team, this board will support a comprehensive school psychologist.

start time: 844:12:50.000
end time: 867:05:40.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Great. And just the other question, this is smaller issue. This smaller issue. The Student Travel Equity Fund that last year was 500,000, this year was 300,000. And there had been some board discussion on two levels. One to take it back to the level it was last year and then also to for the middle grades and it's gone up 200,000. But that means it's the amount the same amount as it was last year but for more grades and just for people who are here. The reason we did that is just the inequities in travel and field trip opportunities for students. So we dedicated some specific funds so that they're students have more equitable opportunities. So I'm interested why it didn't go up if we it's, it's the same as math last year but more, more grades. Did you find people, people who didn't use it or, or what? Because I, you know, I think we're going to go through another year of seeing some still at the middle grades, More equity now at the high school level. But the middle grades just sort of wild inequities and differences between the experience out of school experiences that students have.

start time: 867:12:00.000
end time: 873:56:30.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Yeah, absolutely. So in reviewing some of our expenditures for those last year, we understanding this was the first year. High school spent about 300,000 this last year. Right. Of the 500,000. And so. So as we thought about what this looks like, adding an additional 200 to support the middle grades, that was the initial thinking, at least.

start time: 874:10:50.000
end time: 878:24:28.000
confidence: 0.95
D: So even though they had 500, because my recollection is the way it worked is it wasn't that people applied. It was at the beginning of the year, there was a formula set up and it was sent out. So you're saying it was sent out, but only 3 had of the 500,000 was used?

start time: 878:25:24.000
end time: 896:38:30.000
confidence: 0.95
F: That is my understanding, yes. That was going to be my question as well, because I understood that some of the schools, because it was new, was like, are we actually going to be able to do this? And so people were hesitant to try to, you know, to try to try to use it. And by the time it did, there was a process that had to go through. So what I'm thinking now is like, that as this becomes more of a reality, like, okay, this is actually happening, we can actually do this. And so now that they know ahead of time, I feel like more people are going to apply. But with us just getting it back to where it was, I feel like we're going to run ourselves short as to where. So that's why I was saying that. And when I was bringing it up, I was thinking from the perspective of we need to have an increased cause. People are gonna see like, this is real. Sure. So I'm seeing head nods and a couple agreements. So what we'll do as staff, take that, take this recommendation back and do another assessment and look at what this can look like. So we'll come back with something else.

start time: 896:39:50.000
end time: 906:14:40.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yeah. Chief Garcia, I guess one of my questions is just building off of that is if schools didn't spend the money and they still have it, what I would hate to have is a lower amount and then everybody get a lower allocation. So I think it'd be great if there were a larger, larger allocation or the same allocation of last year, plus extending it to middle schools. But I also, if the decision wasn't made to do that, that if schools held the money back and I'm assuming they keep it, that we not penalize the schools that actually Use their money this year?

D: At the beginning of the year there was a formula. I see Dr. Proctor coming up. There was a formula that it was distributed. So it wasn't that they didn't get it, but they might just not have spent it. But it wasn't like it sat centrally.

end time: 936:23:20.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yes, I'll open up and start to talk a little bit about the process. And if Margaret Calvert is here, I'll ask her if she could please come forward to the dais to share a little bit more. So, yes, we did have a full process in place whereby schools were able to access the equity funds for specific field trips. Remember, based on our formula, we identified a set number of schools or we identified per pupil what the portion of those funds would be equitably to offer to the schools that served our students with some of the highest needs, for example. And then so I'll have Ms. Calvert speak specifically to the process, how the funds were used and then anything, you know, that we could address regarding what was not used and what happens there.

D: We'll update with a board member memo as well. There are a couple things about the equity fund and spend coming out of the pandemic. As we started to travel and to think through field trips, it's a learning curve about getting back into that process. So I just want to acknowledge that.

D: They shared what their plans were, they came back. There are some schools approached it in a variety of ways. What we committed to in the spring, moving forward is meeting with them more regularly as we go through to say, okay, do you understand how we're using funds and would meet with Them quarterly. There were a variety of things that happened and I think that the use of the funds and sort of the impact with students was high. And it was a variety of things.

start time: 957:24:30.000
end time: 957:27:14.000

B: So.

start time: 957:27:42.000

confidence: 0.96
D: So we saw things from athletics, traveling with athletic teams to arts to students, affinity groups, taking trips. So I think that there was a variety of things that happened. Accessing and doing it in the current year, I think really was about getting back into the rhythm of doing field trips and just getting used to doing that again is part of what the process was and for where we were with the fund use.

start time: 965:24:10.000
end time: 979:28:06.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yes. And it's important to note that while we were in the process of, as assistant superintendent, Ms. Calvert says, getting back into the rhythm, the fund actually was able to contribute to 165 field trips throughout the 2223 school year, which was resulting in over 6,000 students having experiences. So that's actually a win. And I think what we hear in agreement with Chief of Staff Garcia that we can look at what would it look like if we rolled over in theory, but found was able to raise some of those dollars at your recommendation and then perhaps intentionally support schools in how they could actually reach out to utilize those funds.

start time: 979:31:18.000

D: Can you repeat those numbers again? I hadn't heard those before and I.

start time: 980:36:46.000
end time: 997:53:32.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Think it's yeah, happy to repeat it. So the Funds contributed to 165 field trips throughout the 2223 school year, resulting in over 6,000 students having these experiences. This supported out of state travel trips for athletic competitions in Washington, Arizona, New York and California for theater students to see Broadway productions in New York and for native college tour to Arizona and Colorado. These are just a few examples. So we definitely with the board's recommendation embedded on this process to increase student experiences. And we see initially in year one that there were some success successes. So we will definitely go back with your recommendation of looking at how we can raise, you know, revisit those dollars, see what is possible so that we could create more opportunities for more students in this year.

D: Were small groups going far distances. Some were large students taking advantage of the city or the state or going to OSU or a college visit. So it's a variety of things. And I think that the principals and their staff did a really great job of saying how do we consider sort of of these large hallmark trips along with some trips that we get all of our students engaged in ways to interact with our city and with our state as well.

C: Yeah, that is absolutely possible. But I do want to add a bit of information about school psychologists and how they are utilized in our system. Very different from like teachers, right. Where you have a class and you have student facing. School psychologists have a caseload of students by which they have to provide support, you know, psychoeducational analyses, etc. And what we would be able to do at any juncture where we're able to make the hire for those school psychologists is then relieve the caseload of the other school psychologists, if that makes sense. So we, you know, you could hire in August, September. You could also very well hire in October and then revisit what that caseload would look like across the system so that there is, of course, benefit. So it's different from say a student facing type of position where it's like.

F: In terms of early literacy. Yeah. So I think that's why I think it's going to be important that staff along the way as we get new guidelines from the state that provide specificity, that we provide you regular updates and get a sense if we're moving in the right direction from you collectively. Right. So we don't. While the paperwork, if you will, is going to get done in October, there's going to be a lot of progress and updates and conversations with all of you leading up to that. So if you signal right, which you're signaling now, for example, the school psychologists are vital that, you know, more work around early literacy. Those are the things that we're looking at as we lay out this plan.

Early literacy, for example, those Awards won't be given out to school local districts till January. And we want to, we want to add those, those interventions with our federal money sun setting. This is one why you see summer programming on here. We want to set and reserve resources to make sure we have some offerings next summer. Just a plug for advocacy because our legislators didn't come through in their last session and passing summer school funding, we hope that they do in this short session that would allow us to further expand summer school programming in the coming summer. So we hope our delegation helps us push that bill through. Thank you.

So this is why you have a little bit of an all star cast, because we know being ready as a school district for the first day of school has a lot of different dimensions, whether it's facilities or school principals being ready or our talent being in place. So you're going to hear from the team, so take it away.

C: Next slide, please, as I try to log onto my laptop so I could see it better. But let's see if I can read it from the distance. Here we go. Excellent. So, yes, we are getting ready for the first day of school and what we know to be true in doing this work is that it takes all summer long to get ready in fact from the spring for the first day. And just to highlight some of the key things that we have going on this month in August we wrapped up last week week our summer programming. You know, giving our summer program teachers and students an opportunity to take a shortened break prior to entering back in this week we are excited to welcome back our school leaders. Yesterday we had our first day back with them and they'll be embedded in, you know, going through a lot of training, development and you know, information sharing about some of our focus and and how we are missioning forward towards this school year. That also includes them coming together with their instructional leadership teams for two days on Wednesday and Thursday next week. Our teacher Summer Institute will be from Monday through Wednesday and we will have additional administrative support, professional development for our school leaders and as well new teacher orientation starts on the 17th and goes from the 17th to the 18th. We are excited about the new teachers that we have hired and we are going to take this opportunity to onboard them, train, develop and provide them the PPS welcome. And then of course we have specifically a SCGCPD day that we have calendared in addition to Nature next the following week when our teachers come back starting officially on the 23rd for their PD and planning days. First day of school is the 29th and the 30th for our various grade bands. And then we are looking at kindergarten starting on September 5th. So we are really excited about preparing for the first days.

B: Could have the next slide, please. Let's talk a little bit about our enrollment, always of interest to this board. There are two images on your screen. The one on the left shows our actual enrollment and our trends in green and our projected enrollment for this coming year in red. As you can see, our enrollment saw a steep decline as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic. And while that decline is beginning to level off somewhat, we are still projected to have lower enrollment year over year for the foreseeable future. As our funding is contingent on our student enrollment. This will have an impact on our fiscal outlook for the coming years. The chart on the right shows our preliminary enrollment as of July 25 compared to our projected enrollment numbers. The column to the far right shows the difference between the two with green and red shading showing the magnitude of that difference. As you can see, we're currently under enrolled in kindergarten and grades 11 and 12. Just be reminded that final enrollment for this coming year will not be finalized until early October. We get to the first of October and then we need to go 10 days or so beyond that for the 10 day drops where we need to remove students from our enrollment if they have not shown up. Following the finalization of these data as we have in the past, we will provide an enrollment update to the board. The next slide please an ongoing question remains why is PPS's enrollment declining? There are a few significant factors at play here. One factor is the birth rate in Portland. Fertility and birth rates in the Portland metro area are down and significantly lower than they are across the state. Simply said, fewer women are having children in Portland. This factor impacts our kindergarten capture rate, which is the percentage of students age 4 and 5 that we enroll out of the total population of 4 to 5 year olds in the metro area. In our catchment area, currently our capture rate is at 79%. This is down from a high of 83% in 2018. So you might be thinking what are we doing in response this year PPS is implementing a refreshed Connect K campaign that creates relationships and outreach to families and expands pre K access across our district. The Early Learners Team, in partnership with PPS Office of Communications and several community partners are seeking to boost Pre K and Kindergarten kindergarten enrollment and to support families of our early learners. Here are some specific strategies that are part of this effort. One is the reimagine Connect Decay which is a public outreach and communication efforts. Examples include lawn signs on all of our sites, district and school level Connect Decay websites and videos, social media blasts and community open houses with targeted outreach events, pre K community fairs, etc. We're also doing site based connect decay events. Every K5 school holds two to three connect decay spring events and one to two connect decay summer events in order to introduce families to their school communities and to support enrollment. We also have kindergarten ramp up so at the start of the school year every kindergartener receives we give them a T shirt says on my way to K. They have a I thought you liked that. Have a full day orientation into kindergarten and then we also have a one to one connection that happens between the family and their kindergarten teacher before the first day of kindergarten. In addition, we also have expanded pre K access this year. So for the fall we will offer over 900 free public pre K slots to 3 and 4 year olds. All of this is summarized and captured on our early learners website. And in addition to that and finally, we have a three school pilot program to increase and improve student enrollment practices. If these pilot schools are successful, we will expand expand to other schools that are seeking to increase their enrollment. And we're piloting at each level of the school system. Those schools are Alameda, Hosford and Lincoln. And that is what I have for you for an enrollment update. Next up is Chief Reese of HR.

C: Thank you, Dr. Adams. Good evening directors. This is a much happier report this year than it has been in the past few years where we've had some pretty significant staffing challenges. So what you see up on the board is 189 currently vacant positions. That might seem like a lot, but if you compare it to last year at this time we had 232 33% instructional positions in the process of being filled. What that means is a candidate has been identified and we have received documentation from the hiring manager and a request to fill. Or they might all the way be in the process of the background check or those sorts of things. But we actually have a single individual candidate identified for the role. So we have high confidence in those positions being filled within a week or so. Some definitions here. Direct instruction. The way we describe that is classrooms. SPED classrooms. Core content areas such as math, science, language arts, social studies. We talk about other school based vacancies. Sometimes those are in classrooms and sometimes they're not. Counselors, social workers, electives, pe, music, that sort of thing. So you can see the distribution there. We have. We pay special attention to where we struggle to hire and sometimes we've had more difficulty hiring in CSI and TSI schools in the past. We are not experiencing that. This year, 45 vacancies is about 22% of our total. And that is about the representation of our TSI CSI schools across our system. Paraeducator vacancies for some context there, we have 486 paraeducator positions this year. So 61 vacancies is a pretty low number. Of course we want to fill every single one of those. We know that filling those positions, filling every single one of these positions makes a difference to our students and to the whole staff team in each one of our schools. Nutrition service assistance. We are at seven open positions there and custodial. See a much different number than you've seen in the past there as well. That's four full time custodian vacancies and four part time custodial vacancies. And with that I will turn it to Chief Franco.

B: Sorry about that. It's not like I've been talking into a mic all day today. But John Franco, I'm the chief of schools. I haven't had an Opportunity to meet you three. So happy. Pleasure to meet you. So I just want to just real quickly talk about school leadership. As was mentioned today, we welcome school leaders back. Today we're really excited about that. We had a great kickoff and then tomorrow Unbound N is going to be coming in and so is staff going to be working with our building leaders from an instructional leadership team perspective. Our theme as as superintendent mentioned is one team, one goal. And together we are brilliant as we continue to push on this notion of collective efficacy. So we're very excited because we've hired some outstanding leaders. You know, the Office of School Performance, HR and also comms was really working hard in July to make sure that as we started the year, every school with the principal and we are there not only with just a principal with outstanding leaders and so really excited about that. In comparison, you know, last year at this time or last year towards the spring, we had about 32 or a year ago had about 32 openings. This year we had, we filled 19, but two of those were already in room placement so they were placed permanently in position. So it really amounts to about 17. And so really excited about that. And we also in about half of those, even more so our administrators of color that we hired. And so we're really, really excited about that. Just a few things, just real quick. So we are working as part of the through the Wallace Foundation, a racial equity centered pipeline initiative. And we're working with Lewis and Clark College in Portland State. We're also working with ODE and TSPC to create continued partnerships and an exact pipeline in order to, you know, build the pool, so to speak, for leaders. Because we know how important building leaders are. Teachers number one, building leaders number two, if you read the research. And so that work has been very important. We've adapted our PPS leadership profile to match the Oregon Leadership Standards. We've began again restarted the aspiring Leaders program. Also when new principals come in, our professional leadership and learning department works really hard with them for a period of three years to make sure they get acclimated with all the things that they need to. In regards to our three learning strands, which is instructional leadership, racial equity, and then leading for and through change. And so we're excited about kind of those types of pieces. And so just to highlight real quick in terms of our Wallace work or our recipe work as we like to call it, we are working not only to create principal supervisor standards, which makes sense, but we're also working to create principal standards, which makes sense, which directly correspond to the Oregon Leader profile or the Oregon Leadership Standards. And so those are some of the big pieces that we're working through. I'm also excited to say that one of the things is, you know, we've hired two senior directors. The caseloads for senior directors and for those of you who don't know, senior directors directly supervise our principals range from like 8 to 12 in terms of load. And so when you think about from a research perspective and coaching, that is exactly what is needed. And so we're really excited about that. And I would say one of the great things that PPS does is that we also have principal coaches. And so there's so our new principals especially are getting senior director support and principal coaching support. And so we're talking about school leadership and enhanced social supports for building racial equity centered leaders. That has been extremely important. So I'm going to go ahead and pass to Chief Dan Young. I don't know if it'll reach Good evening Dan Young, Chief Operating Officer as many of you know, there are eight distinct departments in the office of Operations and we feel good, feel really good. We're excited for students to be back in just three weeks. So from operational perspective and transportation wise, we're in the process of finalizing our bus routes and we will have the routes up on the website here next week. For parents, we're also handing out trimet passes to high school students during registration and over the next couple weeks our drivers will be selecting their routes, training and completing their dry runs. After a very busy summer serving almost 100,000 meals, our nutrition service team is also prepped for fall. Kitchens have been repaired and cleaned and communications regarding services and benefits will be going out to families very soon. The security and emergency management team worked this summer on emergency management training and PD for our campus security agents. The emergency operations plan has been up updated. The emergency management training plan for the school year is ready to go and we're recruiting for just the last four CSA positions right now. From a building readiness perspective, we've completed or are wrapping up dozens and dozens of projects both big and small. Some examples lighting upgrades at Beach, Wriggler and James John, Kitchen equipment replacements at Dunway Peninsula and mlc. Replacement of the Cleveland track. New playgrounds at Marysville and Lent, Flooring replacements at Sunnyside and Abernathy, Accessibility and security upgrades all across the district. We completed eight large scale asbestos abatement projects. Dozens of classroom and office moves have been completed thanks to an amazing move management team. The custodial team has been busy deep cleaning schools and refinishing floors and preparing for students. And, and for those of you who have been at Leadership this week, you saw the new Lincoln track and field in use. Some projects that will continue into the school year include phase two of the Harrison Park Middle School Conversion, Benson Polytech modernization, which is on schedule for opening in fall of 2024, the multiple pathways to Graduation modernization, which is also on track to open fall of 2024, and a number of other projects that are just too big to complete over one summer.

F: I don't know who's going to answer the question or even the best way to pose the question, but it's specifically in regards to the custodians and the nutrition services because that number is much lower than what I had seen before. So my question is are these true new hires and that we brought on new people to fill all these vacancies or are these just vacancies that other people are filling from one space and then I'm also go fill in at another space and I'm, I'm like covering, covering shifts. So it's not like a true hire in that I brought in a new physical body, but I'm using an existing body to do, to do multiple things. So I'm just curious.

start time: 1389:20:50.000
end time: 1394:48:10.000
confidence: 0.90
A: So two things. You talked about the Lewis and Clark important Portland State connection and I know I talked with the soup about this as well. How are we looking at making connections with culturally specific organizations like maybe HBCUs or HSI, things like that.

start time: 1398:12:00.000
end time: 1419:08:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So it's a good question. I mean I, I would say I don't have like specifics in terms of reach outs, but Loretta Benjamin Samuels is the one directly responding or working with or trying to set up those levels of connections with HBCUs, because that is extremely important. And so that is the direct piece. I believe she did have a meeting more towards the latter half of last year in June, kind of starting to start those levels of conversations, I would only add. And we had this conversation. Chair Hollins I think in our recruitment of talent, particularly for school leaders, we want to have diverse approaches. And while we build our long term relationship with two of the local higher ed institutions. We have to be open to other candidate pools. And since we also want to make sure that our leadership is representative of the district's demographics, we should pursue direct pipeline partnerships with HBCUs and HSI. So I look forward this year to initiating some of those conversations about how we create a supportive annual cohort coming our way. And I heard you volunteer that you would help on some of those conversations. So thank you.

end time: 1425:56:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: All right, so the last question I have and then we'll let you have it. She only got like five minutes. No, I got another question first. So for H, this is for hr. So I see a lot of the needs that we still need to hire for. So what do we need to do to get the rest of those positions filled?

start time: 1426:43:20.000
end time: 1444:50:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: We need to keep on track to for what we're doing right now. So with our principals returning this week, we have human resources staffers at Leadership Institute to help principals in person to address any additional hiring needs that they have. Our school senior directors are, are also helping out principals to identify candidates, conduct interviews, those sorts of things. So it really ramps up once principals come back to work as well. And I want to give credit where credit is due. Our principals spend quite a bit of July in any vacancies they have. The difference in having all the principal positions filled as of this week is major difference compared to last year as well. So now we actually have a hiring manager and it's not a senior director trying to hire from multiple different schools. We give additional support to brand new principals who are hiring, going through the hiring process for the first time as well.

confidence: 0.95
D: Well, I do appreciate the fuller staffing. I know that's really important to our schools and hopefully especially our TSI and CSI schools that they'll all start with a permanent teacher on the first day of school and the principal. I would like to see the disaggregated data by workforce categories. There's on the school leadership, there's 50%, 56% of principals hired are leaders of color. But I'd like the disaggregated breakdown also of our teachers and our other staffing. So what does that look like? So again we can see the trends of how we're doing. So that's a future ask. And then I wanted to just briefly talk about the enrollments strategy.

start time: 1461:56:00.000
end time: 1464:29:40.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Quick question. So when we do an ax, it'd be great. I'm trying to track the stuff to know, okay, when are we looking for this information and when could we expect this information?

start time: 1464:42:40.000
end time: 1467:58:48.000
confidence: 0.97
D: I mean, I would think that we'd want to let the staff finish, finish their hiring. And then when we have sort of the snapshot in September or whatever time that is, that we could see that.

start time: 1467:59:44.000
end time: 1468:25:44.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So you want to come back in September?

start time: 1468:27:52.000
end time: 1476:16:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I, I can offer that. We typically see October as our sort of quietest month and our best measurement month. So we usually, we typically use October as our point in time year to year to identify, to look at our metrics for hiring that includes disaggregated by race. And that way we have year over year data that's consistent.

start time: 1476:57:10.000
end time: 1541:35:50.000

D: So on enrollment, the last time we saw a graph that looked like that was in 2003 after the recession, after PPS had been in Doonesbury for a full week when we might have cut school by five weeks but for a big bargain put together by Vera Katz. And we actually got the enrollment back. And so I don't want to just accept that we're going to be where we are. In fact, I think the capture. This is the first time I've seen the capture rate, which is the number of school students in our boundaries who actually attend PPS. I don't think I've ever seen it below 80%. So the fact that it's 79 is concerning. And so I just wanted to. I want to raise a question that I'd like and I'm not sure what form the request trust is in, but we have three schools that there's going to be a pilot and they're Lincoln, Hosford and Alameda. I mean Alameda has over 500 students. Hosford has over 500. It actually has more than projected and Lincoln has 1600. And I'm really concerned when I look at the Southeast Guiding Coalition schools that we have a number that had pretty significant enrollment drops. I mean we have Whitman with, well, it has 160 students. Vestal has 231. You just go through the list and there's. I'm concerned that one of the differentiators is in East Portland. You can actually still stay in PPS and not choose your neighborhood school, which is very different from the west side, which where there's a lot less choices because it's almost all neighborhood schools. The east side, especially Southeast, is full of other options. And I'm concerned that if our focus is on three schools that actually have a relatively healthy enrollment already, that already can Offer their students a pretty rich environment that we're not focusing on schools that, especially in Southeast, that. I mean, I can tell you what, in some ways, what the tour is going to look like, and I hate to have. Would have a secret shopper, which is. What's being suggested is, you know, they may not have people come out for Community Care Day. The school the city made out of, like, fix the sidewalk in front of the school. They might not have, you know, 25 volunteers to welcome new families in. And I. I'm concerned if we don't have an enrollment plan that really focuses on our lowest enrolled schools or ones that are losing. And I know Alameda's lost a lot of students. They went from 700 to 500, but they have 500 students versus Whitman, which serves a very diverse population, and they only have 160 students. And what does that mean for the quality? Just fewer students, less enrichment. So I'm just going to. I guess I don't necessarily have a question other than I think we need a much more robust strategy on some other schools that really face, I think, some much more significant challenges than Lincoln and Alameda and Hosford. Not that I don't want them to be healthy and successful, but I think we have a crisis in some of these schools in Southeast that we were supposedly fixing after two years that class sizes, fewer enrichments. There's a reason why parents choose other schools, and I talk to a lot of those parents. So I would like to get back a much more robust strategy around some of the schools that can't even offer an equitable program because of their enrollment. So October, November.

B: Yep. Yeah, one more Hopefully. Quick question, and you don't have to answer this right now, but I'm just curious about in terms of the timeliness of, like, when PPS posts openings compared to other school districts in our. In our metro area. I'm just curious about, like, you don't have to answer this now, but just, like, in terms of, you know, keeping competitive with the job pool, are we opening these job positions and, you know, as early as the other districts that we're competing with?

end time: 1576:50:50.000

Everybody can, you know, kind of give a little spill about their experience at the Accelerating Board Academy Capacity Capacity Board. Accelerating Board Capacity Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We was at Harvard, so you guys can just give a little bit of spill about that.

Really nice to be able to connect with, you know, with board colleagues and to really learn from other departments, districts in the country and to learn from some of the folks at the business school about what makes a good board. You know, I was there four years ago, so we did some of the same things, but there was some new material as well. And I don't know, I came away really inspired. Inspired about how we do our work and how we do our work best. To see student achievement increase and, you know, be the best board we can be. So I took lots of notes. I don't actually have them in front of me, but yeah, it was great.

B: Yeah, just really quick, just short. It was. I learned the most just from hearing from other board people who worked in other board superintendents that you know about what worked and what failed or what troubles they had and what succeeded. I think that was a very good. Valuable lessons. Lessons to learn about how to govern properly.

D: Sure. This is my second time around, I think less the classes, but more the interactions with. With the other board members, our cohorts, with other school districts. I had St. Louis, Fort Worth, Richmond, San Diego. So really some different districts with different challenges. But I found myself often emailing or texting people back here about an idea I'd heard about or strategy or a common experience or just something a new and different way we could do our work focused on students. So it was a great environment and just in terms of stimulating new ideas, just about how we could do our work differently.

E: Yeah. It's also my second time and I got so much more out of it this time because I actually had applied experience. I could apply what I was learning. We did have a couple of case studies that we read last time, but I took more meaning from it this time. And reflecting back on the experience. I really loved that very first lecture where we learned or heard about the importance of having tension in our organization. Because if you don't experience the tension, you're not doing the best work you can be doing. The second thing I took from that, I believe that same lecture was that seek out people that you don't agree with and interact with them and listen to them. Because if you surround yourself with people who think just like you, you're not learning anything. You're just preaching to yourselves. And I really took meaning to that in this kind of. We're always in a. Or I find myself in situations all the time where it's us versus them. And that's just not effective. It's not the way to get the work done. There needs to be some type of level of collaboration. And so that collaboration happens when that tension happens.

So thank you for making those sessions really meaningful for everyone. And then just a plug, just because I serve as chair of the Council of Great City Schools. The ABC Institute is offered to member district school boards around the country because of the expressed need to engage in some more formal school governance training and opportunities. A chance to collaborate and network with districts and school boards, specifically from across the country on some challenges that we're facing in common or even in contexts that are very different from ours. For them to hear how we're approaching the work. I think that's also enlightening for them. So just thank you, Team PPS Board, for showing up so well. Thank you.

So I took your advice and I spoke up and participated. So I got a lot of it. Really, honestly, I think everyone has said it. Just the exposure not only to the curriculum, but really to other boards and just hearing what they're doing and how they're collaborating together. Heard some exciting initiatives and also just incredible personal stories from board members about what inspires them to be board members.

D: So I wanted this is report from the Local Option Levy committee, which I chaired last year. And at the last board meeting, we had a discussion about the actual referral of the Local option for this November. And just to sort of back up the committee had considered a variety of election dates to renew our local options, including November 2023, May 2024 and November 2024. And those were all dates also May of 2025, which would have been the last possible dates. They were all dates which would have allowed us to renew the local option, which means about $100 million a year to PPS's budget without any interruptions of funds to the district. The committee had decided May 2025 was the least desirable as it failed. As if it failed in May 2025, we would have no other opportunity to ask voters again before we had a $100 million hole in our budget. Then November 2024 was the second least desirable, as that is the date that we have talked for a number of years about having our next bond campaign, which would allow us, in addition to a lot of other things, also address the modernization of Cleveland and Ida B. Wills. And so the two dates that were most advantageous were November 2023 and May 2024. They both had advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of going this fall was that we would then not have two campaigns next year in May having the local option and then in the fall the bond. But there also were some disadvantages of going this November. And after we put together the whole package of the referral, I consulted with the superintendent, I talked to individual board members and other community members, and then I recommended to chair Hollins that we refer the local options in May of 2024 instead of November of 2023. And the factors that played into that recommendation, which her Hollins accepted, was that in the 2023 legislature did not make a much needed fix during the legislative session that would allow us to collect and retain all of our local option. And we need we're going to have an opportunity if we we wait until next May to address that in next year's short legislative session. In addition, even though once it's referred, it's more of an external campaign with the campaign staff and board members, it does require systemic support from our staff. And there's a couple key vacancies right now. And also as well, we just heard everybody's really the top priority is making sure our schools are fully, fully staffed as we start the school year. And then finally it didn't make it. The other reason why I landed on the recommendation to move it to next May is that it didn't doesn't make any difference in the amount of money that we will collect this next year. So it's just the timing of the election not the timing of the resources. And we'll still have an opportunity to collect 100 million a year for five years if we go next May and have a successful campaign, just like we would if we went this November. And we also have an opportunity to resolve a pretty significant legislative issue. So just want to provide the community with an update. Since last meeting, we had talked about a referral this November, but we. The good news is we have all our work done. It's just we can unpack it again this spring and roll it out in the May election. And so that's. Does anybody have any questions or. Okay, so that's that committee. And then just to report that the policy committee had its first meeting the other day. And, and I'm delighted that Director DePass and Director Wong are on the committee and Director Sullivan came and so did our student rep. So we had a full house and we'll have a pretty full committee agenda. If people have ideas of things, policies they'd like to propose or change or rescind, they should bring them forward early this year.

confidence: 0.95
B: No, I really appreciate that update Director of Medwards and I think you really covered sort of all the issues and the factors. And I, you know, for me, what was most convincing was the legislature's failure to pass the bill that, you know, will allow us to make sure we collect the full amount of the levy. And I think, you know, going back in the short session makes sense. I don't want to lose sight of the fact that running two campaigns in 2024 is going to be challenging. And I think we need to, you know, just really be very clear about that with the board, with, with, with the community and with our own workforce about the fact that running a levy in the, in May and then running a bond in November is going to involve a lot of fundraising, it's going to involve a lot of engagement, constituent support. And we really. It's. It's going to be, it's going to be a lot of work for staff, it's going to be a lot of work for the board, it's going to be a lot of work for the community, because both of those things are essential. The levy is an absolute must pass. Right. We cannot lose funding for eight or nine hundred teachers. The bond is also a must pass. This is a promise we've made. The district is on a really positive path with our infrastructure and having these every four year bonds. Again, these, you know, renewal of the bond or a new bond in 2024 won't raise rates. It just keeps them where they are. But it allows us to continue investing, you know, in our schools. So both of them are essential. Both of them have to pass. And passing them in 2024 is going to be really important. So I just, I'm in support of the decision coming out of the committee, but I just want to note that challenge and make sure that we're all sort of aware with really open eyes about what we're walking into in 2024 politically. And it's going to be all hands on deck. So anyway, thanks for the update, Chair from Edwards or Director.

B: Chair Hollins, A different topic, but a conference event nonetheless because you might go home and hear on the 11 o'clock news. So today the White House hosted a summit on Cyber Security in K12. Just wanted to make sure you were aware that PPS was present. Our CTO, Don Wolf, was there with Dr. Jill Biden and district leaders from around the country having a really in depth conversation about cybersecurity. I know we learned a little bit about it in our classes at Harvard. And about five dozen school districts around the country have been impacted by ransomware and other threats. And we often don't talk about that. And there's a reason for it. You know, we're taking all the precautions that we can take because we know how important it is to maintain security over our student data, our employee data, et cetera. So that event did take place today. It's part of a federal rollout of a number of measures, safety measures and cybersecurity that are going to be taking place. But just know that PPS was there informing the conversation as well. So to our cto, Don Wolf, who's probably on his plane trip back, thank you for being present.

It seems exactly the same. 93621 is the same as this bottom one that doesn't have a number PINS sow. They're both piece in schools.

F: I'm so glad that you asked. First of all, thank you, Student Director. I'm not going to say the last name. Silverstein. Thank you so much, Student Director Silverstein, for asking the question. It is my belief that 400 something thousand dollars to pay somebody to come out and tell us what we already know, meaning that we have work to do, is a waste of dollars when. And we can be talking when those dollars can go elsewhere. What I would like to see us do and what I would like us to talk about is how do we do the things that we already know need to be done versus having somebody else come out and tell us we need to do this? I already know that there's a lot of stuff that we could be doing. We already know that there's a lot of stuff that we could be doing that would help keep. Get us closer to have somebody else come out and tell me that, well, if you do it with this school versus doing it with that school, then that's going to be a better use of the money. I think that's a waste and I'd like to. In order for me to sign off, we're going to have to really justify how is it that we've got all these smart people in this building that do amazing work and know a lot of things can't look around our school system and say these are some of the things that we can get done or these are some of the things that we should be doing to help get us closer to carbon neutral. I don't have a problem with being carbon neutral. I have a problem with us spending a lot of money for somebody to come out and tell me what I already know.

start time: 1954:07:50.000

confidence: 0.94
D: Director Green, would it be useful if the. Because I know that this is part of the overall strategy with the Climate Action, the Community Climate, Climate Action and Climate Justice Committee. Would it be useful for you to hear from them of how they see this fitting into the larger. This is the community group that we supported of experts and it's a diverse group. Maybe. I mean that might be helpful so that you could see. So they're thinking about this roadmap's role in the overall.

start time: 1962:43:52.000
end time: 1971:26:00.000
confidence: 0.97
E: And I could speak to it too. So they have specialized experience in looking at building technology and building science and they have actually, I think the city's first or second living building downtown. But part of the strategy as Far as I know from the Climate Justice Group, is to look at where we can either capture carbon or we can reduce our carbon emissions. And it's very specialized. I mean, more than I think anybody in this room probably has. So.

start time: 1971:28:00.000

B: Chair Hollins, can I, can I ask a kind of a point of order question?

end time: 1972:37:12.000

A: Yes.

start time: 1972:39:36.000
end time: 1989:48:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: You know, we never, we never ended up adopting the protocols from last year. However, we did implement some of them, you know, in terms of going forward. And I guess, and Director Green, not to, you know, get in the way of this, my understanding was that we, we had sort of put in place a process where board members could ask for something to be pulled from the consent agenda in advance, and that if it hadn't been asked for in advance and it got to this, it would require a majority of the board to pull it off. And if a majority of the board wanted to pull it off consent, it would be held over to the next meeting. I guess I just sort of want to ask this question, and I will be honest, I have not focused on this particular contract. So I am interested to hear a little bit more of the conversation and Director Green, a little bit more to hear your, your points on this. But I, I don't think the intent of our process was that one board member could hold up a contract indefinitely. I think the idea was that if one board member were to pull it off, it would be put up for a regular vote and then, and then a majority of the board would determine whether it moved forward or not.

start time: 1990:01:30.000
end time: 2001:29:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah, I know that was part of the board protocols, but we never really finalized that. So we haven't really had a practice or discussion decision on that. But in, in respect for time, you know, I think there's some conversations that need to be had around this contract because I also pulled it as well. So I think there's some, some other discussions that probably need to happen. But in review of time, we need to move on with the agenda. So we're gonna go ahead and vote for the items that's on there, minus the one that got pulled, and then we can have a discussion around that with other board members as well.

start time: 2001:36:50.000

start time: 2005:40:42.000
end time: 2006:35:50.000
confidence: 0.92

start time: 2006:57:10.000

start time: 2009:55:58.000
end time: 2025:48:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yeah. So I think just for this one, we will just go ahead and just vote on what we need to vote on now and then we can have those conversations that needs to be had for the directors to understand all the. All the issues that happen. But we. We have a time limit now. So I want to try to be respectful of everybody's time. Thank you. So we're going to vote. Vote on the consent agenda. Approve. We're going to vote on the consent agenda with the removal of the item all. We're going to vote now on the resolution 474 46,740 through 40.

G: Well, I do thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak tonight on behalf of SEIU 503 Local 140. We represent the custodians that keep Our schools clean and safe and cafeteria staff like me who feed our kids. My name is Amy. Silvia. Silvia. I have one PPS grad and one daughter attending Ida B. Wells High School. I'm also a lunch lady at Maplewood elementary and I've been serving kids for 10 years. I'm going to start out on a positive note. We want to take a moment to recognize and thank one of our members. Excuse me, Elois Williams, a custodian at Rosa Parks Elementary. On May 23rd of this year. It started like any other day. At lunchtime, she was in the cafeteria doing her usual routine. You know, keep an eye on the kids, make sure that everyone's enjoying their lunch, being safe. She noticed a student was choking. He couldn't breathe. She immediately went into mama mode, which if you're a mom, you automatically know what that is. She ran over and she did the Heimlich maneuver and basically saved this kid's life. So we're often referred to as essential and heroes, but being a hero is not in our job description. And E. Elois easily could have just said, you go take care of it or you know, not done anything, but that's not what we do. And that's. We just don't. We don't just clean our schools and we don't just cook for the kids. We love them and care for them like they are our own kids. And it's really important for us, SEIU to recognize and thank Elois publicly here at the school board meeting. Elois, thank you for being the best kind of human being. We recognize how important you are to our community and to the Rosa Parks community. We are so proud to call her a member of our SEIE Local 140. Sorry. We're here tonight in solidarity with all PPS union workers because we need you to invest in student facing staff and provide the safe, sustainable and equitable schools that workers need and our students deserve. We've been bargaining. SEIU has been bargaining since February for a fair contract providing a living wage senior safer schools in harassment free workplace. We have made over 30 proposals to address critical issues such as new higher pay that falls below the federal poverty line, lack of health care for part time employees and understaffing so severe that if one person calls out sick, there's not available coverage. Last Friday we had another all day bargaining session, which I pretty sure was our seventh one. So far, PPS has rejected almost everything, all of our proposals and our contract expired June 30. And because we're not progressing at the bargaining Table. Our wage increase that we usually get on July 1, we haven't gotten and we need that. At the last board meeting you heard about multiple complaints of sexual harassment. We were very glad that board members spoke up and committed to taking action to ensure our schools are safe places to work and to learn. We had a follow up meeting on July 21st with Genevieve Rose. She's the senior director, employee and labor relations. Sorry. We were excited to hear that PPS would partner with us to eradicate harassment and that PPS has already hired an independent person to investigate all harassment allegations and that we'd get the name and contact information of the investigator soon. I just got the information this afternoon. Last week, a member of SEIU was fired without explanation 24 hours after filing a harassment complaint against a manager. Is that a coincidence? It feels more like retaliation. We call on PPS to investigate this matter, especially given the district's recent record of terminating female employees when they speak up against harassment of any kind at pps. That was written earlier today. Interestingly enough, after we sent a letter to the board, we got an email explaining that this person actually was fired before their harassment claim. And. And they didn't. And that PPS doesn't fire female employees. I'm not familiar enough with the specific case, so I can't really speak to it, but it was. I just feel like it really erodes the trust that I was so excited when Genevieve was like, let's partner like we want to partner. That was the first time I'd ever heard those words out of her mouth. And I was very excited because I thought that was really great progress. And that's what we want eventually is to work together to make a solution. So this, it just made me feel like, I don't know, it just erodes the trust at work and at the bargaining table. And so I just wanted to put in that we did get a response today. Not when we asked on the day that this person was fired, but we got a response today after we had sent you all the letter saying like, here's another example. If you are serious about creating systemic changes to eradicate sex sexual harassment in the district, there's what we think are four simple steps you can take. Number one, ensure the district follows the sexual harassment policy and protects its workers. Number two, schedule a follow up sexual harassment meeting with all the PPS unions before the end of August so we can get a more district wide understanding of the problems we are currently working on getting a date for that setup. Number three, provide thorough and meaningful in person sexual harassment prevention trainings as soon as possible and number four, conduct an independent district wide harassment audit and share the information with all PPS unions. I know that we just got the name of this independent person and I had asked how you chose this person and they just the reply was that they really wanted a woman representative, which I totally appreciate, but I didn't know how how you choose an independent auditor. I didn't know how that works. So we can Someone can explain that to me some other time. But I'll conclude my comments tonight by drawing your attention to our bargaining platform petition, which you should have all gotten one of these. It's been signed by a majority of the central workers that we represent. We are united and ready to do what it takes to ensure our members get living wages and safe, respectful working conditions. We are asking PPs to bargain in good faith and settle a fair contract now so that when school starts we can focus on our jobs and not on potentially picketing or even going on strike just to achieve the safe working and learning conditions we need to succeed. So thank you.

E: Good evening. Good evening Chair Hollins, Vice Chair Green, members of the school board, our new student rep. My name is Angela Bonilla. B O N I L L A and I'm the president of the Portland association of Teachers. Welcome back for the 2324 school year and as always, I want to start with kudos. So kudos to Kristen Moon. She's been collaborating with our new PAT office staff because we are finally fully staff in preparation for the new educator orientation next week. We always do these presentations together. One PPS employee and labor relations representative and a PAT member. So very excited that we've been able to collaborate. Kudos to everyone who worked through the summer at our summer academies. Our educators, our administrators, our custodians, our nurses, our assistants, our bus drivers, our paras. Everyone who made sure our kids felt safe and connected and supported. And a kudos to our new board members, two former educators. A that's like 200% increase. It's great. I also wanted to take time to share, of course a few concerns and ask for Yalls support in holding our district accountable around a few things. So the first thing is that I noticed the calendar for the school board has changed and now we only have one public meeting and the other is defined as like a work meeting. And that's concerning because we're used to having our every other week board meetings and it seems to be a move away from that kind of accountability, transparency and democracy that we have by having less meetings for the public to be able to speak as an elected board. I hope y'all will discuss the impacts of that decision on our students and families who typically bring concerns to the board once they've exhausted all other options. Also putting us at the end of the agenda when as employees some of our PPS staff go to work at 6am to clean and maintain our sites. Really whomps. So I implore you all to reconsider placing us last so those who fight for their rights as workers are also going are not having to go to work exhausted. It feels like an anti union tactic, especially when the last topic before we spoke the last thing y'all approved was a 3% cost of living adjustment for all non represented aka non union workers at PPS. Union busting is disgusting. So next the district has presented a projection around enrollment that y'all saw. It shows enrollment is declining and has declined for years and I appreciate Director Brim Edwards Context, historical context on how we've been here before. We've seen this before, right? But despite this decline, the CBRC reported last spring that there still was an increase in administrative spending and salaries. The Secretary of State's audit raised a concern about Portland's relatively low proportion of spending on instruction compared to its school district peers. The state Department of Education reports actual operational expenditures by school district based on type of support level of spending instead of just function or object, which is how we get our reports. And there has been no change in that divestment in since the Secretary of State shared this information in 2019. So my ask is that the next time budgets are brought to y'all you ask the following questions. What percentage of our district spending is on direct classroom support? How is that different from last year? How is that different from other districts like Beaverton, Salem, Keizer, Hillsboro? I also noticed that PPS has presented tonight about the additional funds they were provided once the state passed the full budget, which thank goodness they came back to work and did what we asked them to do. And I appreciate that there is an investment in salary increases for our lowest wage workers. It is long overdue. However, I can't ignore the fact that out of the additional almost 24 million, the largest investment is back into the fund balance with 8.5 million. Compare this to the 6.6 million for integrated services which includes something that we're defining as community schools, which has not yet had any community input, therefore is not a community school. 5.2 million for salaries. Remember Paris start at 19 an hour. What's and the 4 million invested in early literacy and 200,000 in to study student travel fund for our sixth through eighth graders. So it is these the PRI budgets show our priorities. So my request is that we ask management, like I heard the board start to ask why this these funds aren't being approved for increased staffing for mental health and special education supports that we in the community demanded this last spring now that the funds are available, especially when we're hearing that admin caseloads are going down and we know our caseloads aren't the fun thing. Also about the school biennium is that the way it's distributed, it is a 49.51percent distribution. So anything funded out of the state school fund, we're going to have that same funding plus 2% next year. So it's not going to disappear. It's not a position you have to worry that we will lose like Esser positions funded by Esser. So I'm glad that staff is going to meet with the Community Budget Review Committee about this and I hope that they listen to those concerns this time around. And just as a side note for everybody else, if you want to know more about community schools and what they actually are, feel free to Google NEA Community Schools the National Education association is the largest advocate and administrator of community schools in the United States. I'm kind of a fan girl of community schools, so feel free to reach out to me also if you want to hear more, especially from a teacher and a union advocate who is from an NEA affiliate. We've asked our Superintendent Chief of Staff for more information around grants available for community schools last fall. We've also invited them to meet with leaders of the NEA community schools work and so we're hoping they take us up on that offer this year. Lastly, I want to speak on behalf of PAT and publicly support and send he healing to all staff and students impacted by sexual harassment and assault in pps. This is not an isolated incident. This is not a few bad apples. This is a systemic issue that PPs must reckon with. PAT stands in solidarity with all those who have spoken up and those who are not yet ready to speak to their experiences. We've been sounding the alarm about sexual harassment in our middle and high schools for years, and not just against women and girls, but also our non binary educators and students. When I taught sixth grade, my only foray in middle school in 2018 and 2019, I had a student take a photo of my chest while I was teaching, used a filter to blow up my chest in the picture and then shared it with fellow classmates. It was another female student who had reported this to me. How do you feel? How do you think that female student felt having to share that with me, seeing that even the women in school with power, the teachers aren't safe from harassment? And how do you think that's going to impact her ability to learn and her sense of belonging at that school? The culture at PPS schools is toxic and causes us to feel unsafe and unvalued, undervalued. I cannot imagine what I would do if I had experienced sexual harassment by a colleague, not just a student that I understand needs to learn. And at the time we had enough staffing to have a restorative conversation with to build repair which most of us no longer have. As Ida B. Wells Barnett said, the way to right wrongs is to shine the light of truth upon them. So I just want to thank all the brave people who've come before us to share their stories and for shining that light. That is how we're going to help solve this problem. Thank you for the time today.

B: Good evening. I'm John McDuffie. I am the president of the Portland Federation of School Professionals, pfsp. We're looking forward to our next scheduled program bargaining session on the 17th of this month and hope to find common ground with the district, particularly regarding compensation. When fully staffed, PFSP represents about 1400 PPS employees in about 70 different classifications. You would see most of the time coming into a school building administrative assistance. They are the most obvious. Most of the people that work for the district through PFSP are invisible to the general public and they work in special education. They're physically closest with the most at risk and challenged students. The environments these students are served in are not usually highlighted in PPS promotional materials and these students are not capable of being taught in general education environments. Frequently and increasingly so since the pandemic sped, employees are engaged with frustrated, dysregulated students who are prone to violent outbursts and physical attacks, resulting in a wide range of injuries to employees. When inadequately staffed, these environments become chaotic and totally reactive rather than educational. Many of these employees remain at their jobs because they possess compassion, huge hearts, and are committed to serving others or giving back. Unfortunately, altruism does not keep a roof over one's head. Working in high stress jobs for less than a livable wage is not a sustainable model for retaining desirable employees. The level of concern and patience required to be successful in these positions is high. Many of those PFSP represent have admitted when directly questioned that they routinely skip their Bureau of Labor and Industry mandated duty free lunches and breaks because they're not willing to abandon their workstations or these children until there has been adequate de escalation or because there isn't any appropriate employee available to provide adequate coverage for a break. Nearly all these Employees work only 192 days each year and are only paid for 37 and a half hours a week. You've heard lots of related testimony I've offered nothing new here. We need to train and retain employees with these skills necessary for these students to grow to build confidence and find success. The loss of trained veteran paraprofessionals over the last three years has been grueling and demoralizing to those remaining understaffed SPED environments or worse. Those environments run by unseasoned staff who require hands on training by burned out underpaid staff is a recipe for disaster. We are stretched thin. We are breaking unfunded mandates aside. These employees and students require attention now. Please find remedies for these employees they they provide the frontline needs of the district's customers, our students and families. Recognize their value. Enhance their dignity. Provide the leadership and support they need. Let their working conditions and pay rates reflect the respect you have for them. I'd also like to point out some positive things in support of the upcoming school year. The district is providing comprehensive clerical and and admin Assistant Training August 15th and 16th. Jay Buno and Michelle Muir have really been stepping up with providing training for new paraeducators. They will be having a two day intensive comprehensive SPED training for new paraeducators August 24th and 25th and then twice each week following that through early November. I'd like to introduce Charlotte Fisher. She is a Paraeducator Pioneer program and she has some statements of solidarity and support for victims of harassment. My name is Charlotte Fisher.
