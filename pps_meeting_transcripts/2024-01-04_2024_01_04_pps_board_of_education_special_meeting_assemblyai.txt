A: And are we live? I'm assuming we're live. Fantastic. Good evening, everyone, and welcome. This special meeting of the Board of education for January 4, 2024 is called to order. The agenda for the meeting and additional materials being considered for this meeting are posted on the PPS website under the Board and meetings tabs. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV services, on website and on channel 28, and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. You know, I used to think, and I know I've said this before, that Andrew and you guys had memorized all this. And now I see that there's absolutely no way y'all could memorize all this. So I'm go back to reading. I just want to let y'all know how much I appreciate y'all for making it seem so, so seamless. And thank you all. Tonight. We have one agenda item for this meeting, and it's the consideration of the appointment of an interim superintendent. Following Superintendent Guerrero's announcement that he will be ending his tenure on February 16th of this year, this appointment will be effective on February 12th, so that there's a smooth transition between the Superintendent Guerrero and our new intern, our interim.

A: At our special meeting on December 13, directors Scott and Brim Edwards volunteered to lead the interim superintendent recruitment effort, including scoping the interim's work, recommending compensation ranges, and with the board building the criteria for the identification and recruitment of the interim. At the special meeting on December 19, the criteria for the interim superintendent was shared publicly. At this time, I would like to ask Directors Bren Edwards and Director Scott for their report recommendation and for the interim superintendent for the board to consider this point. I'll hand it over to Andrew and.

B: Thank you, Vice Chair. So hold on, please. How about this? Does that work? Okay, so thank you, Vice Chair Green. The materials for tonight's board meeting have been posted. What you'll see is a memo from Director Scott and I about the process that we've conducted, a bio for the candidate that we're recommending, and also the resolution for the board's consideration tonight. Directors, as you all know, after we had that meeting on December 13th, Director Scott and I started our work on the 14th, and it required a hurry up offense, lots of year end over the holiday work. As we had a short timeline and we had a desire to have a smooth handoff between Superintendent Guerrero and the interim. Tonight, Director Scott's going to provide an overview of the scope of work for the interim superintendent, the compensation and Also the criteria for the candidate. And then I will speak to the recruitment and the due diligence. We did.

C: Great. Thanks, Director Romanwitz. Yeah, I'll be brief. We covered this a little bit as a board when we talked about this process, but just to sort of remind us all in terms of what we were looking for in this process. So there's a. An overall scope of work for an interim superintendent. It's really defined already in Portland public schools policy. Policy 1.5 0.10 p. And what it really says is that the board delegates to the superintendent full responsibility and responsibilities of the chief administrative officer, the chief school administrator, the chief executive administrator, the education leader for Portland Public Schools, custodian of school funds and school clerk. In addition to those standard responsibilities, we also recognize that there are a number of open positions and may need to be some hiring at senior level positions over the next six months. Chief level are higher during the tenure of an interim superintendent. So as you'll notice in tonight's board resolution, it states that the interim superintendent may hire for senior positions at that chief level and higher as long as the terms of employment for the specific position are approved by the Board of Education before a candidate is hired. In terms of overall compensation, we did ask staff to do some salary mark comparisons, looked around at what other jurisdictions were paying and you know, the. In this process, we made some adjustments for the professional experience and educational attainment of the candidate. And then also standard administrator benefits for the interim superintendent as well are included. And then in terms of the overall criteria, which again we've, we've talked about, but I think it's worth going back to as a board, we really discussed what we were looking for in terms of characteristics for an interim superintendent. One of those was a track record as an effective district leader. Another was having a track record of supporting equitable educational systems and structures. Experience as a superintendent, specifically Oregon school district experience, if that was available, experience running a mid to large size school district or other large system, understanding that the job is really to keep Portland Public Schools moving forward versus you know, looking for disruption or changing course really to keep us on pace with our current vision and direction. We also, I think importantly wanted to find an interim who was not going to be a candidate for the permanent position. Again, I think this allows for a really open and fair recruitment for that permanent position and also really allows the interim to just focus on the current job and not feel like they're trying out for a permanent position. And finally, quite obviously, we needed availability for mid February through June of 2024, and I'm hopeful that we have found that. I'll turn it back over to Director Bim Edwards to talk a little bit more about the recruitment process.

B: Thank you, Director Scott. So as part of the recruitment, I spoke to many senior leaders in Oregon and around the region as part of our effort to have a comprehensive recruitment of candidates who best met the criteria that the board had set. It was really heartening for me when I spoke to leaders in this state, many of them who have been superintendents or led other districts, of their desire to help us find someone who can help Portland be successful and continue the work that's underway. So lots of people rooting for us to have a very successful leadership transition at Portland. So generally in a search, it's a positive match if you get 75 to 80% of the criteria that you've set in a given candidate. In this case, we identified and I believe recruited a candidate who meets 100% of the criteria that we set. And tonight Director Scott and I are recommending the appointment of Dr. Sandy Husk to be the interim Superintendent of Portland Public Schools. Dr. Sandy Husk is an experienced superintendent with 18 years of experience as a public school superintendent, including seven years as the superintendent of a large, diverse school district in Oregon, the Salem Keizer School District, where she had a track record of promoting and supporting student achievement and equity. She also led the Salem School District when it passed the largest at the time capital bond in state history. In addition to her leadership roles at school districts, she's also led a national nonprofit. As the Chief Executive Officer of AVID Central, she led the organization that works with approximately 7,500 school districts that impact about $2.5 million, 2.5 million students annually. She's also been a teacher, counselor, principal and district level education leader prior to becoming a superintendent. Dr. Husk also has a Doctorate of Education from the University of Colorado in Denver. I met Dr. Husk more than a decade ago as part of a national three year school improvement cohort supported by the Wallace foundation and Harvard. I found her passionate about public education, students, data equity and bettering outcomes for students. Since then, I've had an opportunity, many opportunities to work with her. Whether it was working issues at the legislature or at avid. I found her to be someone who's relentlessly focused on improving student achievement and equitable outcomes for students. She's more than qualified to serve as Portland's interim superintendent and she'll continue to move the work forward that is already underway as part of the process over the last three weeks. I've also completed reference checks with labor and educational leaders, including many here in Oregon, who've worked with Dr. Husk in various professional capacities over a sustained period of time. In addition, we've had a thorough and comprehensive background check done by an independent investigator. We have a strong, highly qualified candidate who's willing to step into this role if appointed. And as a board member, PPS alum, and parent, I'm excited that Dr. Husk is willing to undertake this role. We want to be clear tonight that Superintendent Guerrero will continue to lead the the district over the next five to six weeks. And assuming Dr. Husk is appointed tonight, I expect there will be a smooth transition with Superintendent Guerrero in February. And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Vice Chair Green to get a motion on the table.

I wanted to let it be known, let it not go unnoticed, of all the work and time that you guys put into this. So I just wanted to say thank you to. For stepping up with this assignment and knocking it out the park. So I just want to say thank you for that. Dr. Husk, I want to say thank you as well, for stepping up and accepting this position. Your dedication to our kids and to our city is admirable, and I am looking forward to working with you as, you know, you lead our. Our district forward. So thank you to you as well.

E: Okay. I just wanted to reiterate what Director Holland said about thanking Director Brim Edwards and Director Scott. I appreciate all the work you did, and also in making sure we all had a chance to talk to Dr. Husk. And I think that was the most helpful thing for me. The bio, of course, is wonderful to read. All your experience will be great in this interim period. But in talking to you, I could tell that the warmth and the care was there. And anyway, it was very nice that we were set up, so we kind of got to know you a little bit before voting And I do appreciate that. Welcome. Well, we're almost ready to vote I think.

And like everyone else said, thank you so much to Director Brim Edwards and Director Scott. I not only appreciate all of your hard work, but also your commitment to including me in the process. And then also welcome to Dr. Husk. Just even speaking with you for a few moments of was clear how much you cared about students and also including student voices. So I'm really excited to work with you and welcome.

C: Yeah, thanks. So this is all echo some of the same comments. I think we're lucky to have Dr. Husk step into this role. I have similar experiences. I met you and talked to you over the last couple of weeks and I think you're exactly what we need. I mentioned that in my opening remarks, but I think we'll be looking for that criteria. You really are the person to help us keep the district on a path moving forward and continue to achieve our goals. So thank you very much for being working to do that and other people service all my thunder. But I want to be really clear and thank Director McDowartz for the work that she has done over the last few weeks. I played a relatively small support role in this and she did amazing calling and outreach and networking and just really the work on the ground during her vacation over holidays to bring Dr. House to Portland Public Schools. So thank you Director. I could support you in a little small way but with the credit work process. So really appreciate.

H: My comments are pretty much exactly like everyone else's. Wanted to thank Directors Scott and Brim Edwards for your work, particularly Director Brim Edwards for scouring the state, your networks and Rolodex, if anybody still uses that and finding a candidate that so aptly and so well matches what we are looking for right now. Really glad to hear that the student representative was included in the conversations and I was also happy to get a few minutes to Talk with you, Dr. Husk and get to know you a little bit better and and your background. So thank you. I'm just really pleased going into this vote tonight.

B: So I know I already spoke about how Dr. Husk matches the criteria we set, but I wanted just to make some comments in support of this appointment. And I want to just start by saying, you know, when you're looking for an interim, sometimes it's tempting for people to think that this is going to be you know, we just need a seat warmer or somebody hold, you know, hold the place while we do our permanent recruitment, recruitment for the permanent superintendent. But this is not the case at all. Sorry, Dr. Husk, I don't think I misled you. We have a lot of work underway and during the next five months, big work needs to move at the district. And that work includes things like rebuilding relationships after the month long strike, implementing the new contract with Portland association of Teachers and doing that well and effectively in partnership with the teachers union, finalizing contracts with our other representative employees, managing the spring budget process and advising on the needed budget cuts, continuing the modernization of Benson, planning for Jefferson High School as well the center for Black Student Excellence. In addition, we are going to have a local option likely on the May ballot. So this is not going to be a. We're just standing still. And I know I shared this with you, so it's not a surprise. I just want to repeat for everybody, like, we've got big work ahead, which is why it's really important that we have somebody who's experienced, who can step into the role, who have a smooth handoff with Superintendent Guerrero. Superintendent Guerrero has really moved the district in such a big way since August of 2017. And I know, Dr. Husk, that you're going to continue to advance the district's work on behalf of our students and in support of our school staff. Earlier I talked about the experience that Dr. Husk is bringing to the district and why she's well qualified from that standpoint. But I also want to speak for a moment about how she does her work because this is really important. And when I talk to the many references and just people who I know, Sandy or Dr. Husk, over the time period that I've known her, I think there's many common themes that people and ways in which that people would describe Dr. Husk. So I'm just going to share some of those because I think how you do your work, it's not just what you get done or what you accomplish, but how you do it. So Dr. Husk is a good listener, an excellent communicator, skilled team builder, collaborative, courageous. We're going to need that this spring. Focus on data and improving student outcomes. Systems builder. And she's very focused on students and to Director Sullivan's point, loves children. And that's all going to be very important for the work that we have upcoming. And even more, I think almost to a person that I've Talked to about Dr. Husk over the last several weeks that they mention how she's focused on building, and I know this personally focused on building and maintaining relationships and building the relationships with staff who are in our schools and our central office. And we're going to need that in the months ahead. So I want to thank you, Dr. Husk, for your willingness to consider the assignment. And I know you're going to be a strong leader and partner for the board as we get after that big work that we've got ahead of us.

A: All right. Seeing no other hands go up, I want to take this Moment to welcome Dr. Sandy Husk tonight and appreciate your willingness to consider this appointment. I'd also like to give you an opportunity to provide some comments before we, as a board, take action.

F: Thank you. Good evening. First of all, I'm extremely honored that you're considering me for this position and very humbled listening to the things that Julie, excuse me, Director Brim Edwards, learned as she did her work. And then your own personal comments about our brief but significant conversations that we had. That's a joy for me at this point in my career to bring my professional experiences to Portland Public Schools in the support of students through educators and staff. I know I have a whole lot of listening and learning to do, and I look forward to doing that with you as a board, with the leadership of the district, with the employees of the district, and with the community as well. I also want to say I appreciate the comments about the past, the hard work that's been done as board members, as community members, as leaders in the community. It has been a lot of hard work. And I want to acknowledge that there will be a whole lot more hard work in front of us, even during this short time. But all those repetitions I have means that I'm prepared for the joys and the opportunities which sometimes feel like challenges. And I think that if we continue to be transparent and communicate and stay focused on the right goals, we'll get through those in a really productive way. My job, after listening to each of you, is going to be to provide continuity and to be sure that we continue always focusing on student learning and equity. So thank you for considering me, and I'm really excited to be beginning this in February. And I will be on site as soon as I can get into Portland after the transition happens. So I'm very honored and I'm very humbled. Thank you so much.

And with that being done, I believe that's it. This meeting is adjourned. And the next regular board meeting will take place on January 9th.
