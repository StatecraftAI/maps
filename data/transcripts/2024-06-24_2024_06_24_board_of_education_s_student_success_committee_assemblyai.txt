A: Great. Because they did. Wondering what they're talking about here. All right, so I guess the point of today is just kind of wrap up the year and we want to have kind of a quick discussion about how this year went, kind of reviewing what worked, what didn't work, what things we wish could continue and then move into the discussion about how we're going to shift, change things or what we recommend. Obviously, if different people lead the students, it's up to them. But at least some recommendations or at least we're trying to work on a charter for a coming year to kind of keep things going. I know. Dr. Proctor, or. Sorry. Yeah, Dr. Proctor. Roseanne, we had some discussions early online. So, yeah, let's just start with that. What. What are some things that we think worked well this year? Let's. Yeah, let's just start with that.

start time: 39:55:30.000
end time: 56:42:56.000
confidence: 0.95
B: It seemed like a lot of the things that we started on ended up going to the policy committee. So I felt that the field trip discussions went well and was a good start to take to policy committee. I felt like I learned a lot when we got information from people about charter schools. The JROTC sort of went immediately. So we didn't really do too much of that. So I felt a little scattered. I felt like we didn't get any student voice in there, Very little student voice, and that maybe that would be something to look for next year to ask what they wanted to talk about. Actually, are we still talking mostly about what we remember?

start time: 56:44:48.000
end time: 57:01:00.000
confidence: 0.88
A: We can move on.

start time: 57:29:40.000

B: What to do next year.

start time: 58:01:08.000
end time: 58:32:40.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Yeah, yeah, we can move to that, too.

start time: 58:48:20.000
end time: 106:05:20.000
confidence: 0.96
B: And I kind of. We have to decide do we want to discuss new ideas for student success or do we want to get information on what's already working to share? So that's kind of two different ways to look at it. And as I said, the student voice, how to bring that in because we have students on the committee, but we never really heard from them. We didn't ask them either to share. So that was partly us. And I think some things that we really need to discuss for student success would be attendance. And I think we could definitely bring students in on that to see what might change attendance. I've also gotten the feeling in visiting schools that there's teachers that feel they're not heard and they've got ideas but they're not being listened to particularly. There was somebody who had done a unit on genocide that she had shared and she did that in response to I believe there's a state law that you have to teach the Holocaust. And so she had gone from there and started with the Holocaust and then had students do work. And I saw some of her work. And so I think there's teachers out there who really want to share what's worked for them. Also recruiting and keeping teachers of color. I'd actually like to hear more about the IB program and how it works in different schools with different students, with different levels of different grade brands. And again, just hear ideas from principal as well principals as well as teachers about what's working in their schools. Let's see. Well, and then we've gotten some. I think it was an assignment, but we've gotten quite a few essays from students about what's wrong or what can change. And one that I just got today, there was the other day, class time requirements. They think there's too much time. Then there's others that don't think there's enough time. Also heard a lot about enough time to eat your lunch, the length of the school day, maybe a four day week. So there's tons of things to talk about. But do we want to just hear what's going on or do we want to hear other people's ideas about what could happen? So sort of two ways to.

start time: 106:25:00.000
end time: 124:15:20.000
confidence: 0.97
D: I love that. If I may jump in, Director Sullivan, I love that question. And I think what would be helpful, helpful for me as I. I know that I may not be necessarily an always attending member, but I think it would be helpful for me to understand what you all as board members see the student success committee being able to provide for you to be able to do your board director work. Because I also want to make sure that like some of the things that I've heard just right now are things that leadership and others will be diving into and unpacking. And so I just want to make sure there isn't a duplicate effort of Work. And so I guess I like, I love that you're asking the question about what it is you need. And I think what would help me is your hopes and wishes for this committee to be able to inform the work that you need to do as board members.

start time: 124:51:00.000
end time: 126:06:36.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Yeah, no, because I didn't know how to answer that.

start time: 126:09:08.000
end time: 167:05:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah, I think that's. Dr. Sullivan, like when you said it, fellow scattered. I think that's probably my biggest concern about this year and how it went. I feel like. So I think, Dr. Armstrong, to also answer your question, I think one of the original goals of Student Success Committee, something I was pretty excited about, was tackling the issue of graduation requirements. Tackling the issue of how to, you know, the big question, right. How do you raise rigor and graduation rates at the same time? Right. Because you know that, that's, you know, age old question, you know, how to. And I think there was some exploration where we started doing that. And then we kind of got pulled in multiple directions during the year. The field trip thing happens, ROTC thing happened. And then we, you know, little things that we have to do like charter school oversight and the other things that happened. So I feel like that's the number one question that we should answer. Like, for example, what is a successful student Success committee outcome? Right. Like, should we have, should the year's work result in a policy recommendation? Right. Something that is really well fleshed out and something that, you know, everyone feels like it would help contribute to a better district. Right. Or it should be focused on exploring, a discussion, discussing. Well, I was hoping for, you know, graduation requirements. And you know, Dr. Armstrong, I'm glad you're here because, you know, having been the previous chief academic officer here, I'm sure you have a lot of insight on this as well. So I guess that's, that's kind of why it kind of led into the discussion. The second question, which I'll just tap into since we're already talking about it, you know, would it be helpful to have a charter, something that kind of gives the Student Success Committee direction so that it can maintain its focus and not be pulled in multiple directions, you know, because one thing about my thing is I'd rather just do one or two things, do it well, rather than, you know, 50 things that we just barely touch on. Right. Which is what it kind of felt like this year.

start time: 167:28:50.000
end time: 191:17:30.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yeah, I appreciate that. And I, I don't. I'm still learning how the other committees function. So I don't know if the others have charter. But just taking that one example of focus on graduation rates. I guess my question would be if it is looking at graduation rates to make maybe some other proposals or other policy changes. I guess I wonder, is that policy committee work? So. But yeah, I'm glad that that's the first question to grapple with, and I'm glad that we have our new chief academic officer here as well to be in the conversation, because we want to be helpful and we want to make sure that these committees are meaningful and helpful for you to be able to do the work that you need as board members. And I also need to make sure that, you know, some of those operational things continue to move appropriately through leadership. And school buildings like this doesn't, you know, become that place where, you know, know, folks began to move issues up, and then we process those issues that are happening in schools or with different parts of our instructional program because we have a venue for that. So I just. I love the question. And so thank you for leaning into this discussion with me.

start time: 191:50:30.000
end time: 200:30:50.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Yeah, I guess I'm really not sure what we're supposed to be doing. I guess so. You know, are you the same? I mean, that's what you're talking about. Charter. I mean, when I joined, I got put on the student Success committee. I thought, well, great, because I was a teacher, obviously you want to see what's working for success. But then I don't know if we really did anything or.

start time: 200:51:50.000
end time: 218:58:00.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Well, that. So sorry, I don't mean to take all the talk. Let me just jump in and see that. If I hear you saying that, you know, maybe the original intent or maybe the original thoughts was creating a space to inform and for. Because if I remember correctly, and. And Dr. Proctor can correct me if I'm wrong, but if I remember correctly, one of the things that I heard early on was that this would be a space to be able to hear about some of those things that were happening with the instructional priorities. Because what was happening in board meetings is that it became a place to process, like, what's up with the math curriculum and what are we doing for literacy and things like that. And so it was like, oh, great. The student success committee in its first year, in its formation could be that place where we can do deep dives into informing about all the different parts of the instructional program. And so I'll just pause there, since we have the two that's been with you all all year who can share a little bit more. But that's what I recall from the fall.

start time: 219:03:00.000
end time: 220:07:08.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yeah. Thank you for that, Dr. Armstrong. Can everyone hear me? Okay?

start time: 220:10:04.000
end time: 220:17:32.000
confidence: 0.79
A: Yes.

start time: 220:18:36.000
end time: 302:16:00.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Okay, great. Yeah, that's pretty. That's pretty much spot on. We. In our agenda setting for the Student Success Committee, we. We did take on that approach. And I think in my reflection and sharing my own reflection on this year, I think we. We kind of got. We were started off on a nice trend in that. Over the. We laid out for the months, for a few months in advance, but over the course of the months, you know, the topics that we would introduce and share in the space of giving not only updates on what we were doing and with curriculum, with graduation requirements and special ed was another topic that came up as well. We shared information. And then the board asked back, you know, where are. Are there any barriers to having this work continue on in a successful fashion for students? And it opened up, I think there was a. There was the possibility of it opening up into really great dialogue. And what I also recognize at the same time is simultaneously during regular board meetings and the agenda setting for our regular board meetings, there was also the request for similar information, I think in my reflection, drawing that distinction. I believe you're right, Dr. Armstrong, in that that was the intention. And yet because all board members were not like to say involved or in attendance for the Student Success Committee, it still ended up becoming a requested information still at the broader board meetings. So thinking back, perhaps we can look at. Thinking back and thinking forward, we can look at ways that we can share an update with all board members regarding what is discussed in Student Success Committee so that we could keep the discussions and the focus on student outcomes happening in this venue and then find a mechanism, find a mechanism for moving the conversation to all board members so that they also feel informed if they're not attending. And then another thing, and I'll reflect on two more things, and then I'll pause my own personal reflections is that we started off on. You mentioned before graduation. And I think that was a really robust conversation because what the conversation was really about was how board members identified that some of our students, you know, parents, families, community were concerned and board members absolutely were concerned about while we were seeing an increase in graduation rate, how do we ensure that our students are truly proficient academically. And when we did the comparison and looked at state requirements, we had a robust conversation to say state requirements are really set as the minimum and that here at PPS we can have a discussion about what it would look like to raise the standard of graduation so that we could ensure that we know that we know that we know all of our students are proficient at the point of crossing our stage and receiving our diploma. And we were not able to continue that conversation because that definitely would have led to an outcome that we could have taken perhaps to policy committee and looked at inserting some additional, you know, measures, if you will, where the state stopped with the essential skills testing. You know, the question was what measure can we put in place as PPs? So those are a couple of my thoughts as well. But we definitely did start off on. I think we started off on the right path, at least with the right intention. And then how do we ensure that we're staying on that path going into next year?

start time: 302:50:20.000
end time: 330:20:20.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Thank you, doctor. I think you laid it out really well. I think that was exactly what the intent. So I guess my next question is, I mean, to kind of expand upon that, one of my original discussion about student success committee and how it formulated, if I'm remembering correctly, I might be remembering correctly, but one of the hopes that I had was also an avenue for district staff to also not just inform the board, but maybe even preemptively propose new ideas to make the work of educating kids easier. For example, looking back upon this year, things like we had kind of a change and it was discussed in policy committee, like the change in credits, whether they transfer from middle school to high school. Right. And things like that. Those would have been great topics for us to kind of flesh out here or even just like changes in policy that would be recommended. So I guess part of my, my original goal was to also be an avenue for district staff to be able to propose things to the board that needed change to make. Let's be honest. Education is in America. The fundamental truth of education in America is that there's too many jobs and too few people doing it. And so whatever we can do to make that better, at least that was one of my, my hopes.

D: Yeah, no, I, I love that and I, I hear you about having that opportunity to make recommendations to the board. My wonder in that would be the way that we already have set up or. And I'm sure we're going to be visiting this, this summer. But when we think of work sessions or study sessions or those other information items that we bring forth with recommendations is a process already designed. And I just, I would hate to. You know, I do think that there'll be some things that it makes sense to have to process with a smaller group before taking to another. But then when I just think of the totality of Things that are before the team, how that fits in the larger picture. I think one thing that could be impactful is meaningful are the board goals. And if, when you think of the student success committee and our board goals that are around student success and the measurable outcomes, if we were to create a structure that allowed for us to do deep dives on those Borgos and even recommendations, like I remember during the interview process, a question was asked is like, are these the right Borgos? And, you know, do I feel like they can be accomplished in a year? Like, those would be wonderful questions to do some deep dives on with the team and with some of the governance members.

start time: 362:02:30.000
end time: 368:54:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I think you're right that the whole board does want to hear about what we discuss here as well. So that really means the staff's got to go to two meetings, or do you feel it's helpful to discuss it with a smaller group before you present to them? Lars Rowe.

start time: 369:34:40.000
end time: 386:12:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: That's a good question. And I am thinking, as you are asking the question, Director Sullivan, that I'm wondering, is there a mechanism where instead of repeating the content or bringing the content to the whole board at a board meeting, if we can do an update to the board on the discussions and topics covered, and rightfully so, in this session, in these meetings, we should be bringing data if we're talking about students. And then any update that we have within the data could be shared as well. So that way, the entire body, the entire governance body feels and sees the work that we're doing in this committee, and they'll feel informed as well.

start time: 386:38:30.000
end time: 388:54:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: But you're thinking of informing them in a smaller, just quicker way?

start time: 389:05:10.000

B: Asked, are there comments from committees?

start time: 391:15:50.000
end time: 410:43:30.000
confidence: 0.96
E: What we could do is we could assist directors, the board directors who are in the committee, we could assist by creating a report, an update, a newsletter. I'm not sure what it could look like. And then at the board sessions where you do your committee updates in advance, we could send you, you all could share, or we could share on your behalf a full report or update with some data on the things that we have discussed in the committee and the progress we believe we are making towards the board goals. And that could be a part of how we are updating everyone collectively, in addition to you sharing out. Because there is, during the regular board meeting, there is that point where the committee chairs share out, you know, what happened in their last committee meeting. So we could help you by providing an accompanying document, report or newsletter.

F: Hi. Sorry, I was just Going to add. I mean, thank you, Dr. Proctor. I think just echoing that. Sorry, I'm in transition. I was. The school was closing that I was at. So I need to now driving. But I think. Yeah, I think any. Any sort of like pre planning we can do to say these are the areas of focus and this is what it's relating to and uplifting in terms of our board goals would be really helpful. I feel like oftentimes this year when we were asked to share out instructional information, particularly around curriculum, we weren't able to think about it in terms of like a larger scope and sequence and how we're really reporting out on things. And I also think the ability to think about.

F: Using this space and then also then what would a board meeting want? And this space I see as more of an intimate space where lots of questions could be asked or diving into more information and then the board meeting could be more of. Yeah. The higher level overview or quick updates. And I think that would be really helpful to our teams as well as we're thinking through and planning maybe even.

start time: 435:51:50.000
end time: 441:49:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: The reverse of kind of what you're saying where like we would touch upon it in the regular board meeting and then say if you want to deep dive into it. The student success committee is planning on talking about this with all the data because like you said, this venue, the advantage of this venue over a regular board meeting is that it is much easier to have a robust conversation.

start time: 442:37:50.000
end time: 447:57:54.000
confidence: 0.95
C: The way the board meetings are set up is you do both conference reports and then there's also a time on the agenda for committee referrals. So you can say tonight we had wonderings or discussions around attendance and what we're doing to help increase attendance. So strong high school board goals.

confidence: 0.93
A: It'd be almost nice to have that kind of planned ahead. Right. Like for example, when we. We look at the board plan for the year and be like, oh yeah, we're going to be doing our data dive in. I forgot when we do our data dives, March. Right. And so the next student success committee is like for the deeper dive. Right. For if you really want to talk about it in a real conversation. Yeah, I like that.

A: I'm kind of hearing a couple things. So I'm hearing one. It sounds like if we're talking about perhaps doing a recommended charter for Student success committee, it seems like, number one, it should be centering the board goals. That's all I got. Number two, I also hear we don't want to be scattered either, right. To be. To keep that focus. So I think that maybe that would help, but also not to be repetitive like having the discussion here, here, and then having to have the same discussion in the. In the full board and regular board meeting. So I guess my question next is how.

start time: 480:23:30.000
end time: 491:35:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yeah, I heard. I thought I heard Cheryl say though, that it would be nice to talk about it here and then again at the north, but I'm not sure exactly. And Eddie kind of suggested it the other way around. How deep where. I mean, it makes sense that in the smaller group you could talk about it more. But then again, the whole board does want to know, and I don't think just talking about what happened in your committee in five minutes is going to satisfy.

start time: 491:46:10.000
end time: 509:27:32.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, I agree with that. I think two things here are true at the same time. I was really saying it the way Director Wong noted it, right? That we could give a broad overview update. And at the same time, there are natural points within the year when Dr. Adams does the data update with the board, right? When we have, I think it's about two, maybe twice a year, three times a year, he. We present some student achievement data, some graduation rate data, some of our benchmark data in terms of our assessment, our common assessment that we use. So those. Those two things can also happen at the same time. Right. So there will be intermittent points of.

end time: 523:39:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Where the data will drive the conversation. The student achievement or student performance data updates that we give the board can still happen as a capture point, right? So if we're meeting here monthly, we can give a monthly update of the Student Success Committee, again by a form of a report or a newsletter or, you know, some. Some documented or printed information that we could provide the entire board and then know that intermittently and in between when we give our student performance performance or student. Student outcomes data updates, then that is also another entry point on a larger venue where we can continue the conversation.

start time: 526:30:40.000
end time: 553:32:46.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Is there a wish list that staff may have of the Student Success Committee as well? Because I, you know, I. Because one thing I. Yeah, I think so. I think part of the charter recommendation, right. Would be that the planning should be with the agenda setting for the regular board meetings. So that way we can do Both. Right. We can have the deeper conversations here. And then we have a. The nice thing about having a deeper conversation here first is that when we go to the board meeting and say, like a board member raised that question, we can always refer it to the video of the Student Success Committee. Be like, hey, you know, we answer this question, go check out, you know, June 24th student success committee meeting. It's all there. Right. And that way it would save staff more work from having to present twice. Right. And then we could work with the calendar to do the other thing, which is plan ahead where like when Dr. Adams presents our growth data. And then we can be like, this is going to be the first part and the second part we will have in Student Success Committee. And that. Because the reason I think that also works really well is because then you get the board members who really want to know about it to be coming to the committee or attending or at least watching. Right. Instead of the other way around, which is like, oh, sorry, you missed it. Right.

start time: 553:33:58.000
end time: 559:06:10.000
confidence: 0.92
C: I think that's exactly right. Because right now we do see that with the policy and facility operations committees is that board members will come to those meetings when they know there's a topic they're interested in. So I don't think that's just a matter of having that plan for the year so they can to appoint the note home.

start time: 559:20:30.000
end time: 559:32:50.000
confidence: 0.84
A: Great.

start time: 559:39:10.000
end time: 575:02:00.000
confidence: 0.97
D: I love that. And I think, to answer your question, the wish. The wish list, I think what you just said, Director Eddy would be number one is creating that charter so that we have that focus. And then the. The school side of the team understands the charge and, and what's being asked of or required of them. So that's helpful. And then I love the part that you just said about. I mean, that shows that we are pretty strategic in the way that we do agendas. And when thinking about the scope and sequence across the year to be able to present and then know that there's a trailing agenda item happening in the Student Success Committee where it'll be a deeper dive focused on, you know, multiple parts. Like that really speaks to me. So I think my. My request would be those two things that you just stated.

start time: 575:37:00.000
end time: 585:13:30.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Also, there are opportunities that the board does vote on, on things that could be heard first in the Student Success Committee. So an example would be the school calendar. You know, right now it goes to the board for a presentation, like at a meeting before it goes to student success, I mean, before it goes to the board for a vote. But that could be also something that's previewed Here. And the committee can say, we are in support of this. That makes board meetings more efficient. And you can ask questions potentially just some ideas of what we've done in the past.

start time: 585:25:10.000
end time: 585:46:38.000
confidence: 0.98
A: That's a good idea.

start time: 585:49:34.000
end time: 588:40:20.000
confidence: 0.87
C: Can you do that now with. Although this year you didn't have it, but you'll do that for like charter school renewals and extra. They come here first and you give the recommendation moving forward.

start time: 589:09:20.000
end time: 591:44:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Okay, got it. Charter deeper Dive after growth data presentations, school calendar or something like that. Or something like that.

start time: 591:45:20.000
end time: 593:03:00.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Other items that the board takes action on that could be pre discussed here.

start time: 594:02:40.000
end time: 603:23:20.000
confidence: 0.97
D: And then maybe we can identify those things. I'm thinking on the technical calendar type of items, that would be annual things that happen. And then on the instructional side, if we know that there are some. Some things coming up, even like those grant renewals and some of those other hot topics, we can get that on there as well. So that way, even with create when creating the charter, we can look across the year at what those items may be.

start time: 603:39:00.000
end time: 605:13:20.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Yeah. Like, we have the smart goals for next year on the sei.

start time: 605:45:40.000

A: J.

start time: 606:20:20.000
end time: 611:19:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: He did such a good job. Dr. Adams did such a good job on that, setting those goals. We looked at that at the audit committee the other day and the way that he had, you know, even though they didn't have smart goals for this year, he did talk about what happened with attendance.

start time: 611:29:30.000
end time: 611:46:30.000
confidence: 0.70
C: The cbo.

start time: 612:00:10.000
end time: 615:59:30.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Yeah. And so next year, I think that will be a big item because he does have specific goals for those different groups.

start time: 616:02:10.000
end time: 616:28:34.000
confidence: 0.91
A: So. Like RESJ Contracts.

start time: 616:29:22.000
end time: 619:19:20.000
confidence: 0.85
B: Yeah, RESJ review. Yeah, I think that will be a really big deal next year or I hope it is.

start time: 619:25:40.000
end time: 632:33:00.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Okay. My concern, John, I think those topics are great. Again, I have always that concern because one of my regrets for this year and leading this, chairing this committee is that I did feel like we got too scattered and pulled in multiple different directions, that we didn't really have a chance to focus and just do one thing really well. So I guess, you know, like, if we have all these top. Like I have topics to preview, like you said, grant renewals, RSG contracts, school calendar, charter schools, which we have to anyways. Right. So, I mean, that's already five. How many meetings do we have a year? You know, typically once a month. Right. So it's like nine to ten. Right.

start time: 632:43:20.000
end time: 633:38:40.000
confidence: 0.91
B: So, yeah, we didn't have quite that many, but yeah, close.

start time: 633:40:40.000
end time: 634:33:20.000
confidence: 0.87
C: There's a little. Yeah, they're busy in November, so.

start time: 634:34:00.000
end time: 646:06:40.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Very busy. Yeah. So one month out. But, you know, at the same time, you can always do More than one thing at each meeting. Does that. Does that sound like a decent chart? Okay, so again, I'm trying to, like, sketch out a charter as we're. As we're talking about it, right. Charter piece number one is kind of focus on board goals. That should be the. Now that I said it out loud, but it's still very vague. So how does. What are.

start time: 646:26:30.000
end time: 651:54:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Well, I definitely attendance and teacher retention definitely focus on board goals. I mean, those are very important to me. So I would think reporting staff, reporting back on what's happening there. I think it's very important.

start time: 652:09:10.000
end time: 682:17:40.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So I guess. I guess maybe let me kind of bring back. Yeah, like I said, so bring back the basics. We kind of have two purposes of student success community that I'm seeing right now. One is informative, right? Which is. It's a venue for board and staff to discuss deeper into issues and also share with others. And then the other one is oversight, right. Looking at revenue as large J contract, maybe even school calendar charged with. And then I guess the third one I'm assuming is some kind of actionable item, you know, like, maybe, if you're lucky, a policy recommendation. Is that something I'm kind of hearing? You know, I'm just trying to figure out, like. So I want to have, like, the end. The end goal insight. You know, like, you figure out, you know, where you're going first before you make out your lesson plan. Right. Where your objectives are is one of the objectives potentially. You know, when we're talking about, like, focusing on board goals, I mean, we can talk about all that we want, but if nothing comes out of it, I mean, informative is a fine goal. Nothing. I'm not trying to diminish that at all. But is there other, like, things we want to create, you know, like, for example, policy recommendations? Is this sort of like a branch of the policy committee that only focuses on policies that affect the board or changes that staff may recommend or want? I don't know if I'm being entirely clear, but I'm kind of asking the question at the same time. I'm thinking of it. So.

start time: 684:17:30.000
end time: 690:56:40.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Yes. So expected the same question. Did you want it just to be informative or actionable in some way, but then it's staff that's being actionable, Right? We're just trying to look at the action and understand.

start time: 692:47:00.000
end time: 707:33:20.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I wonder about being informative plus actionable where the staff, like you say, Director Sullivan, can maybe given questions or further information that may be requested, could get into action around that and then bring back the information or Back to the committee. Right. So, yeah, I kind of see that as maybe a cyclical thing, in and out, give and take information, giving information to the committee, taking some feedback, perhaps, and giving and, you know, sharing additional information if it's requested type of thing. That's what I'm thinking.

start time: 708:04:20.000
end time: 730:38:50.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I love that. And I think one of the reasons why I said Borgels and then thinking further about it, you know, if one of the claims that we make, and I believe that it's more than a claim, but one of the claims that we make is that all that we're doing across our system is centering the students who are black and Native. And so when I think about that, you know, I wonder about those actions and how often we come together as a community to talk specifically about that. Right. So the board goals are steeped in the experiences and achievement of black and Native students. Right. And so, you know, I just. I wonder what the student success committee, you know, should the student success committee also make sure that every conversation is also examining how the experience is, no matter what we're talking about, is reaching and touching and moving our students who. The. Who are the furthest away from academic achievement, which in our system is Black and Native students. So, like, really holding that as a core to further our commitment to not just, you know, having the conversation or listing it as a goal, but also being an active discussion about it.

start time: 731:11:50.000
end time: 731:39:42.000
confidence: 0.96
B: About how it's really working.

start time: 731:41:26.000
end time: 769:45:30.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Right, right. What's. What's the real story? Right. And what are those experiences and stories we're bringing back from the field? You know, I've had an opportunity to be in conversation with some members of the community. And, you know, we in the central office, like, oh, well, we're. All of our work is about black and Native. And there are some folks that are in the community who identify as Black, Native, and sometimes both who don't feel that same area of focus or feel like things are being created so that they would have the opportunity. Opportunity to, you know, receive resources that were not available to them in the past. And so just, you know, keeping the conversation centered and focused and also being able to do some deep dives on those outcomes. And if we're doing what we said we would do, right, is center our black and Native students being able to have a conversation about, you know, are we doing what we said we would do, and if we're not, then what do we need to do differently and what is that practice going to look like and how is it translated not only in leadership, but in the classrooms and when students arrive home, what are we hearing from those? And so when I think about the team and being able to pull some information back and have it be informative, I think of it as more than just saying, well, here's this data point or here's this report, you know, board, I want to hand you this. It's being able to add in the stories and the narratives, maybe even I can imagine having some student success committees where we have some families and leaders and teachers show up, you know, maybe not in. In high numbers, but enough to give a testimonial to share what their individual experiences are. And I know that there's danger in a single story, but as we began to hear from more people across the system and support it with data, now we're having the conversation that happens outside of Portland public. Right. And I also think it's those type of conversations that we need to have publicly to begin to not only win trust back, but as I said before, build it for the first time.

start time: 770:31:20.000
end time: 785:09:40.000
confidence: 0.90
A: A lot. It's. I would even say, because you're. The way that you present it, it's almost an oversight role, right? Because if we send it in the BOR goals, it's an oversight role because it's saying, hey, are we actually doing this and checking in every month? What are we actually doing? Centering our students most in need, our black and native kids. But it's also not just overseeing the district, but it's also potentially oversight on the board. Right. Is the board's actions focusing and. Or are you forgetting about it and moving on? Right, Focusing on our board goals. So I think there's a lot of potential there. So when we talk about actionable items, oversight is a totally valid, very actionable. Right.

start time: 785:40:00.000
end time: 800:50:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And I know what you mean about, you know, single stories, but I did some volunteering in the school this year where the board goals were not being met. I mean, it was crowded. There were too many people who needed special help. And actually when I talked to another principal and told her that I keep been in a school, she almost cried and gave me a hook because it was like they didn't feel that people really knew what was going on. And so when you say that, I think that's really important now how we do that. We can't all go to different classrooms when we can't hear every story. So it's. It's going to be. I don't know exactly how to do it, but I think it's a wonderful idea.

start time: 801:50:20.000

A: Yeah, I think like you said, I think this is not only serving the board and committee members, but it's also serving staff. Right. To know like this is what the student success committee is for. This is a venue for if you have, you know, issues or, or dealings with it, these kind of things, you know, gives a. A purpose. Yeah, I feel like we have a lot of good stuff to work with, I guess. Do we need to go through it and figure out what we agree upon should be part of that or do we just want to wait through go from there?

start time: 822:53:20.000

end time: 849:33:40.000

D: Okay, great. So I know we have an organization and then I don't know, depending on you all if you're in leadership roles or if you want to stay on this committee, if you want to move to another committee. And I don't think we need to figure that out now because I don't know how that's all going to be worked out. But it makes sense to re. Engage in this conversation after leadership has been established and we understand who's over committees because then it also then allows me the opportunity to work with staff to find out who will be the liaisons. And I think because there's only two members, you know, I'll be setting up. I know we have the monthly one on ones, but I'll also be setting up two on one and three on one meetings. And so perhaps maybe directors Patty and Eddie, we can meet and just have a check in about maybe some of your hopes and wishes, whether you're staying on or it's a legacy you're leaving so that it's properly reflected in a charter. I think we have enough to get going on at least some draft while we wait to see how the reorganization takes, what that looks like moving forward.

start time: 849:44:00.000
end time: 870:46:30.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Yes. And Director Green is also a part of this committee, although I'm not sure if he's. It doesn't. He may not. May not have been able to attend today. And I was going to say that I absolutely concur as well that starting with a draft charter, if you will, as a starting point, you know, the timing of when that happens absolutely makes sense to revisit it when we. When the board is in reorganization or an organization. I don't know if it's a re. Or just an org and thinking about too, planning out. It would allow some staff to offer some input on what the calendar could look like over the course of the year as far as that cadence of when data is available and when we're beginning some performance updates to the general board versus, you know, topics that we can cover that are aligned to the board goals and allow that cadence of insight, information and oversight.
