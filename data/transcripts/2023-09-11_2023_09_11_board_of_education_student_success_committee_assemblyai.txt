B: Yeah. So we're going with the staff updates. Yes.

start time: 43:47:10.000
end time: 50:30:00.000
confidence: 0.93
C: So I want to say before we start with the staff updates that what we. The content of the staff updates this afternoon is in follow up to our last meeting and we were going to just share some information that came from board direction and requests that came out.

start time: 51:23:00.000
end time: 81:01:40.000
confidence: 0.96
D: So my understanding is that the last meeting there was a request to understand what it might cost to move all of our middle schools to a seven period day, knowing that all of them are on a seven period day. Presently, we have some that aren't. And so my team usually does that kind of costing and estimating. So I'm happy to share with you what that means. So with a seven period day, we have two things we can do. Option one is we can use our current staffing formula. And if we do that, it'll cost us just under 7fte. We only have 5 middle schools that are not on a 7 period day. Those are listed before you. Gray, Osford, Jackson, Selwood, West Sylvan. If we use the current middle school staffing formula, teacher student loads would increase by about 20, which would incur additional costs that aren't shown in the 877,000 based on teacher overages. As you know, in our current agreement with the Portland. As you may know, in our current agreement with the Portland association of Teachers, whenever student class size or the number of students at the high school level, middle school level exceeds a certain point, teachers receive additional compensation for teaching that number of students. So option one raises that on average by about 20 per teacher. Option two, we could do some revision to the middle school staffing form. That will cost more FTE. As you can see, it'll cost a little over 11 FTE for a cost of just under $1.5 million. And this also will raise student loans, but by half of what option one.

start time: 81:02:20.000
end time: 81:16:00.000
confidence: 0.84
E: Would do.

start time: 82:10:20.000
end time: 94:08:50.000
confidence: 0.94
D: The other. I have one more slide, and then I'll be ready to take questions if that's okay. The other part around middle school redesign is what about our K8s? Right. Our comprehensive schools that have middle grades as a part of their enrollment as well as elementary grades. Currently, only one of our 14 K8s is on a seven period day. And that's Fabian. The rest are not. And that in these data, in that count, we are including Access Pioneer and Metro Learning Metropolitan Learning Center. So the cost to bring our K8s along is 12 FTE for the tune of 1.5 million.

start time: 95:39:10.000
end time: 99:55:12.000
confidence: 0.95
F: I got a letter from a parent saying that going to the seven period day shortens the periods to 35 minutes, and that wasn't enough time. Have you heard that complaint?

start time: 99:56:16.000
end time: 102:47:28.000
confidence: 0.97
D: I have not heard that, but I can certainly my team and I can look into that because we have insight into school schedules via our student information system. Joanna, do you have any additional context?

start time: 102:49:04.000
end time: 102:58:40.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Sure, sure.

start time: 102:59:20.000

confidence: 0.93

F: When you go to.

start time: 104:03:04.000
end time: 105:15:06.000
confidence: 0.90

E: Yes, thank you.

start time: 113:10:40.000
end time: 117:05:12.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So again, my question with SO according to that slide, it increases the teacher load by 20 and the option 2 by 10. Just. Sorry, my memory's a little fuzzy right now.

start time: 117:08:16.000
end time: 117:15:52.000
confidence: 0.81
E: So the.

start time: 117:16:16.000
end time: 121:02:26.000
confidence: 0.92
B: The schools are not at 507. They're of. At five of six right now. Right. And so when. Yeah, 15 of seven. Also increase the amount of prep time for the teachers.

start time: 121:02:58.000
end time: 121:15:10.000
confidence: 1.00
E: As well.

start time: 121:36:10.000
end time: 121:53:22.000
confidence: 0.91
C: So with five of six.

start time: 121:53:46.000
end time: 122:21:10.000
confidence: 0.87
B: Okay, so one's going to be advisory.

start time: 122:33:30.000
end time: 124:43:10.000
confidence: 0.98
C: With five of six, teachers are teaching five periods. With five of seven, teachers are still teaching five.

start time: 125:18:50.000
end time: 127:14:28.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Then the two of the seven that. So who teaches the other one would be advisory.

start time: 127:16:04.000
end time: 128:56:40.000
confidence: 0.92
C: It's on the master schedule. So there's a rotation by period, but no one teacher would teach.

start time: 129:27:40.000
end time: 129:58:00.000
confidence: 0.93
H: That's why you need more teachers.

start time: 131:37:00.000
end time: 133:26:12.000
confidence: 0.94
B: But they would have longer prep times. Right. Because they would have two of seven periods. Or is one of them advisory? Is that why?

start time: 133:27:56.000
end time: 139:18:40.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Well, we have to carefully analyze that because recall that when we go to seven periods, the periods become a little bit shorter Then, as Ms. Tobin shared, than if we had a different schedule. And I don't want to speak out of turn, so let us analyze that to see that's a. How much of an increase or a change in planning time.

start time: 139:19:20.000
end time: 139:31:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: That is.

start time: 139:40:40.000
end time: 140:13:04.000
confidence: 0.93
D: We can certainly get that information to you.

start time: 140:14:32.000
end time: 140:24:16.000
confidence: 0.64
E: Right.

start time: 140:26:48.000
end time: 144:00:20.000
confidence: 0.91
H: And middle school planning time is a little more complicated because of differences in start times and whatnot. So there's. Anyway. Yes, we're happy to help with that.

start time: 144:08:00.000
end time: 144:20:20.000
confidence: 0.72
E: Great.

start time: 145:05:20.000
end time: 149:57:00.000
confidence: 0.96
F: And I don't know if this has to do with the periods, but I also got a letter. People are worried about stuff, obviously about getting rid of a high level math class. Is that happening anywhere?

start time: 150:28:10.000
end time: 155:16:34.000
confidence: 0.95
D: We would have to investigate. I don't believe from our academic team there's been an elimination of a high level course. I wonder if a building leader has made a choice in their scheduling that they're not aware of. I've not heard that.

start time: 155:19:22.000
end time: 156:31:46.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So I should answer that saying to get in touch with you.

start time: 156:34:18.000
end time: 156:39:30.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Sure.

start time: 156:40:10.000
end time: 157:19:50.000
confidence: 0.91
D: It could be me. I'll take the ticket.

start time: 157:40:50.000
end time: 158:43:06.000
confidence: 0.90
C: Yeah. Or the chief of schools or. It depends on the level.

start time: 158:44:18.000
end time: 159:31:06.000
confidence: 0.96
F: We could have sounded like middle school.

start time: 159:33:38.000
end time: 160:24:58.000
confidence: 0.96
H: So can you. Can you state what. What the question was again?

start time: 160:25:54.000
end time: 160:59:38.000
confidence: 1.00
F: Well, I'm trying to keep going.

start time: 161:00:34.000
end time: 162:20:10.000
confidence: 0.96
H: I'll see if I can. I think I heard a high level. Did you say a content area? Was it math?

start time: 162:21:30.000
end time: 162:31:38.000
confidence: 0.94
E: It was math.

start time: 162:33:14.000
end time: 166:37:46.000
confidence: 0.86
H: Okay. So I. I think we can work through and discuss with you sequencing of math courses through middle and I. And single subject is any acceleration and whatnot as well. I can bring that in a future, maybe more clarity.

start time: 166:40:58.000
end time: 166:47:06.000
confidence: 0.90
E: Yeah.

start time: 166:47:38.000
end time: 174:12:34.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And any question I have, feel free to answer at a later time too. My other question is. So, I mean from the last meeting, again, just refreshing memory. Our goal is to go to five or seven for all schools, Right. Well, hopefully it seems like the eventual goal. And the reason being is that it adds in. It doesn't take away the options for electives, but at the same time we can add advisory and also increase options for time in PE as well, right?

start time: 174:15:22.000
end time: 174:28:18.000
confidence: 0.55
D: Yes.

start time: 174:31:14.000
end time: 176:27:46.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Is there like what was the historical reason of why these schools haven't gone.

start time: 176:28:18.000
end time: 176:51:10.000
confidence: 0.88
C: To five or seven yet?

start time: 177:02:50.000
end time: 177:53:22.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Is there or is it just. Just didn't get to it yet?

start time: 177:56:26.000
end time: 194:48:20.000
confidence: 0.92
C: I think if you. We consider budget Terry Finance as we're presenting here today, part of the reason why we have not been able to automatically offer all schools 5 of 7 is because of project each time. I think there had been a standing practice and with the six period day having teachers teaching five periods within that. And then when we saw some of the benefits of what could be possible adding a seventh period and adding more flexibility, we just realized that financially and budgetarily. And then I'll pause so that team could share any other insights that they.

start time: 194:49:00.000
end time: 194:58:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Have.

start time: 195:57:00.000
end time: 198:15:20.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Seven periods and the main reason for the seven periods is to get that counseling part in there. Correct.

start time: 198:21:00.000
end time: 210:20:52.000
confidence: 0.96
C: When we have five of. When we have five of six, there's limited options for electives. Students don't have a lot of choice and that elective tends to be consumed by what is state required like a pe. So with that limited choice, you know, our students don't always feel good about their schedules all the time and they would love to add another elective if the school is able to offer it. And oftentimes schools, the best way that schools are able to expand on the offering of electives is by going to.

start time: 210:21:16.000
end time: 212:51:16.000
confidence: 0.94
F: A seven period because you can't cut out one of the required. But it's not necessarily because of the counseling.

start time: 212:54:28.000
end time: 215:33:20.000
confidence: 0.96
C: There is a huge benefit with the seven period day with advisory SEL and all that we can build.

start time: 216:17:00.000
end time: 229:32:12.000
confidence: 0.92
H: I think it seven periods allows for students to do to both have robust pursuit of electives and sort of choice courses that they want to pursue while also receiving necessary supports. So you could see LD instruction for example, and some learning center special ed supports that are built into a schedule in a way that support students as well as opportunities for pursuing choice and then also opportunities to accelerate. So the flexibility is just greater in the day to both student needs and then also student interest.

start time: 229:35:16.000
end time: 232:45:30.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Okay, this clarifies it for me because last time we were here it seemed to me it was mostly focusing on social emotional time. But it's not necessarily.

start time: 232:46:50.000
end time: 234:21:10.000
confidence: 0.78
C: It's yes for choice in addition to the benefits of the social.

start time: 234:40:50.000
end time: 240:28:02.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I think one example, if I can remember also like it increases opportunities for especially for a lot of kids in special ed to not miss out as much on their general ed classes so they can participate more in the General ed classes and still meet the requirements in terms of getting, you know, their specific classes and also try to get.

start time: 240:28:26.000
end time: 241:33:50.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Them to have a fun class too. That's right, that's right, that's right.

start time: 241:57:30.000

end time: 251:51:06.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Great. Any more questions? This is really good. Thank you for putting this together. It helps to kind of see where we're going. I assume that. I guess my, my, my last question before we move on to the next topic was is there, is there a general, like, kind of plan or in terms of eventually getting middle schools to the five or seven? Or is it just kind of. We kind of have to wait and see where our budget is going to.

start time: 251:52:18.000
end time: 252:19:10.000
confidence: 0.70
E: Or how it looks.

start time: 253:02:10.000
end time: 261:05:46.000
confidence: 0.97
C: That's all part of the middle school redesign plan. I know that there's some materials being prepped, I think at some point for presentation to the board, but in the middle school redesign report, there is a plan that talks about what some of those actions are that we plan to take not just this year, but for the next few years. I know Joanne can probably talk a little bit more about that, but I also know that there'll be a report.

start time: 261:06:58.000
end time: 261:47:22.000
confidence: 0.93
F: That will be coming soon to the board.

start time: 261:49:06.000
end time: 263:24:30.000
confidence: 0.93
C: To the full board. Yeah. And we also talked about middle school redesign. That was part of our presentation.

start time: 266:48:50.000
end time: 279:46:30.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah. So the next part of the presentation comes from the request from Vice Chairman Green. And so we have some very high level information. It is just exploratory to try to answer his question. The question was, could someone look into what the possibility would look like? And so today we just have just brief points of high level. There is no plan currently to move forward on any of it. It's just to again answer our vice Chair's questions on jrotc.

G: So just a few updates. We have reached out to the 8th Brigade, which oversees Oregon as well as several other states to learn more about the process. They've indicated that there's an application that school districts typically fill out. They have given us a warning to say that there are schools that have been approved to offer JROTC but haven't been able to find qualified instructors. Much the same way that school districts are having maybe teacher shortages or sub shortages, GRTC schools are also having instructor shortages as well. There, for example, Madras High School has a program but currently doesn't have a qualified instructor. On the following slide, I was informed initially that if we were approved for a GRTC program that we would receive full funding for the instructor. But in a subsequent conversation I've learned that that's actually only qualifies for half the funding. And all programs, GRTC programs are required to have two instructors. So the school district would have to pay for one. The US army would pay for the other one. All the equipment supplies would be covered by the Army. I've reached out to Oregon City High School as well. They have probably the longest established program in Oregon and the state. And actually had a conversation with Sergeant Aguilar just this past Friday. He was very gracious with his time, offered that he can be a support to us if we were interested. He had a lot of great things to say about the program and would be, I think, a good partner if we were interested. And so those are a little, you know, some of the updates. If, if this was something that we wanted to learn more about, perhaps the next step would be to check in with high school principals to see if any of them are interested.

C: The investigation that we would have to do. We have not considered this here at PPS previously. It has not been a serious consideration here at pps. So it's going to take a lot of investigating to identify the benefits, cost, benefits, desire among schools, community and stakeholders. So again, this is very initial early information. We would have to explore and investigate to get data.

Who will present to us? Chief Buno is chief of Student Support Services and Cheryl Michelle Vera is over. Our senior director over Special education.

start time: 371:52:12.000
end time: 374:44:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah. And four of us in the room, special educators, if we could raise our hand, total of four at least so we, we all could carry the conversation.

start time: 374:56:50.000
end time: 379:14:02.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And as I know you both are educators and so there's components that might not go as deep into. Because I know you're familiar with it. However, I'm actually just stalling till the slides come up.

start time: 379:14:26.000
end time: 379:23:50.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Right.

start time: 380:07:20.000

E: You'Re good.

start time: 380:55:20.000
end time: 392:34:10.000
confidence: 0.92
C: And we said that, you know, what we want to be really intentional about and I'll just help Jaylon and stall is that we want to ensure that we are keeping the conversation of special education. Oftentimes unfortunately and it's been. It's an age old phenomena that we tend to talk about core academics and not count special education as a part of core academics, which it is especially if we are engaging in a model that is truly inclusive and allows students to access a variety of classroom experiences.

start time: 392:55:50.000
end time: 393:24:10.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Yes, thank you for saying that.

start time: 393:42:30.000
end time: 414:53:10.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Special education frequently gets brought into conversation even in folks bringing concerns to work meetings and or just via email and consequently to present not only how and why and where special education functions in the district, but what our program looks like, what we've learned about our program and where we'd like to go with it so that people are on board with knowing that. And so as you know. So this is the part I won't go as much into. But special education is rooted in. It's actually three different federal laws facilitate special education. The primary one, which everybody is aware of is IDEA Individuals with Disabilities Education. Then there's Section 504, the Rehabilitation. Then there's ADA Title 2 and all three of those. PPS works to ensure that students identified as eligible for special education access to a term. And I'll use this and try to make sure each one of the acronyms I use but a free and appropriate public education which through definition is that they're able to access the educational services that PPS provides and benefit from.

start time: 415:48:50.000
end time: 424:05:50.000
confidence: 0.94
C: IDEA deals with individuals with disabilities 504 and Americans ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act. Those two focus on access. And so an individual may have a 504 plan, for example so that they can access the learning environment, but they may not be a student with disabilities identified as special ed.

start time: 424:45:30.000
end time: 447:14:20.000
confidence: 0.93
E: So there's a few things connected to the Individuals with Disabilities Education act that are primary women in this. And I put there's a lot of words on there which is custom in special education. Lots of stuff. But Basically to the maximum extent appropriate and to basic trying to think about least students must be educated first of all in the neighborhood schools and with non disabled peers within the least restricted environment which is through legal definition there's no specific requirement for this but the general education classroom and or the most or most amount of service available to them to benefit from. So it's. We provide special education services in schools. We provide special education services in PPs and hospitals. We provide them in residential programs. We provide them in day in residential programs. Our first and primary focus is to ensure the students have access to the general program which is algebra or English class or whatever it is. Hit the next slide. Special education has a lot of acronyms in them. Alluded to first one's fate. So that's regardless of the cost of the program. The district and the state provides it.

start time: 447:35:20.000
end time: 447:49:40.000
confidence: 0.84
C: Yeah.

start time: 449:04:40.000
end time: 500:56:10.000
confidence: 0.93
E: And then each. Each student within special education has an individualized education plan which I know you're aware of that describes the program not what the district offers and it continues services. So the IEP is the students finds how we go about educating that student least restrictive environment. Talked about related services. Those are things that allow the student to access their specially designed instruction. So those are transportation, speech language services, occupational therapy, speech therapy and then supplementary agent services are the accommodations and other supports that we provide for students access the general education program and then specially designed instructions. Kind of the heart of it all. It's the way in which we adapt instruction to ensure the students access it. And it's all outlined within that individual. So next slide please. There's lots of due process. I'll skip through this. I think you're aware of this. Students are referred for special education, then they're evaluated and then team creates an iep. Next slide please. And when a student is identified as eligible, there's 13 categories of disability in the state of Oregon under which they can potentially qualify for. Basically identify being eligible means that not only do you have a disability and this is where you separate from 504 you have a disability, you require specially designed instruction. That disability adversity impacts your educational performance. 504, you may have a disability but you can benefit and make meaningful progress with accommodations. So that's the difference. It's the need for the additional instruction. Can you go on to the next slide? And then the individualized education plan is. It includes a lot of information about a student but outlines what their program is so how much additional instruction they have, what the accommodations they require, how their progress is being monitored, individual goals for them. Related to how they're going to make progress in what they're being instructed. So they have reading instruction, they have goals, as you probably track progress. Anyways, go ahead to the next slide. So in PPS, as Dr. Proctor alluded to, we are focused on providing inclusive special education services and we actually do a very good job of doing that. And I have some data I'll show you in a couple slides related to how effectively we manage and support that as a department. We are focused on ensuring students have skills needed to independently function in college, career, independent living in. So I just summarized all those things really quickly for you right there. Belonging, engagement are a big deal. Ensuring students are part of their community, part of their neighborhood, school, part of their classrooms and then ensuring in addition to that, that we provide inclusive support of academic, social, emotional.

end time: 501:10:30.000
confidence: 0.73
B: So.

start time: 501:52:50.000
end time: 512:22:54.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Next slide please. So currently PPS serves about 7,600 students. So these are students that we serve both in district and out of district in our CBOs and our charter schools in what something called the Columbia Regional Inclusive Services. And we may. We have a few students that we serve that are placed out of state. So it's the entire number. It's, it's always a, it's. It's a number that moves depending upon enrollment from month to month. But that's the demographic, demographic breakdown and overall percentage of students that we are serving and supporting as of last week.

start time: 512:25:42.000
end time: 512:37:30.000
confidence: 0.70
B: So.

start time: 513:29:10.000
end time: 514:04:30.000
confidence: 0.81
F: And then I have, I have a question.

start time: 514:05:10.000
end time: 514:16:50.000
confidence: 0.58
E: Yeah.

start time: 514:27:50.000
end time: 520:41:00.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So I know when I first was on the board and we looked at the things we were had to say we could pay for and one was like two nurses, no full time nurses to help certain special ed people. And do we get our money, do we get a lot of special ed money from somewhere else in the state?

start time: 520:55:20.000
end time: 521:02:56.000
confidence: 0.88
D: No.

start time: 521:04:08.000
end time: 521:21:52.000
confidence: 0.99
F: Do we have to?

start time: 521:24:56.000
end time: 533:55:56.000
confidence: 0.94
E: So our primary, for our primary revenue through is through the state of Oregon. It's a weighted formula. So every student eligible receives more than other students. So that's the primary resource. In addition to that, there's a high cost student fund which if there's a percentage of students, certain program that costs over. I'm just. This isn't the number. I'm gonna throw it out. If it's their program costs over $100,000, then the district receives a little bit additional funding for them. Then the Federal government provides IDEA resources both for the K12 program and the preschool program in the numbers. That's all.

start time: 533:57:08.000
end time: 534:38:00.000
confidence: 0.97
F: But does a lot of it come out of our general fund?

start time: 534:43:00.000
end time: 537:08:40.000
confidence: 0.93
E: So we spend all of the resources received to serve students with disabilities and Then also encourage on the general fund. I don't have.

start time: 537:20:20.000
end time: 537:36:28.000
confidence: 0.91
F: But we do get help.

start time: 537:37:24.000
end time: 537:57:00.000
confidence: 0.93
E: But still you can find all that.

start time: 537:57:40.000
end time: 538:34:52.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Sometimes think the public doesn't realize how much.

start time: 538:36:36.000
end time: 597:40:30.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Correct. We expend 100% of our resources allocated to serve students with disabilities and then encroach on the general fund. Pretty significant. In order to fulfill our obligations, we provide a. I'm sorry, we provided continuous services. So this is something that comes up in different places that talk about special education. So this idea that there's a continuum of supports or continuum of services. So it's like a continuum of level of instruction. So in Portland, we don't provide early childhood special education. We belong to a consortium that's run MECP which is early childhood program. And so we ensure that our students are served, but they do it in support within our schools actually. And a lot of the preschool classrooms. And then we provide learning center type supports which is every school has this and it's focused on kids who primarily participate in general education most of the time. And then we have specialized classrooms focused on communication behaviors that serves a lot of students on autism spectrum disorder, social emotional learning supports, behavioral needs, intensive skills are students skills students with more significant needs. We have therapeutic school and you've probably heard of as pioneer schools, Therapeutic school. And then we have in the district we support day and residential treatment programs. You often hear them referred to as dart. So PPS supports special education services delivered at the schools. And then we provide transition programming so when students with disabilities who have continued need until age 21 graduate or fulfill their high school program, they can continue in the transition program. We provide that to about 200 students a couple locations across the district. Special education isn't a place though. Special education is a service. And so I talk about classrooms, which is something that is a system. And I'll talk more about this next time that we're going away from because we want to ensure that students have social, emotional learning instruction and mental health support or it's not a place to go. So we're in the middle of a transition right now. And so I just mentioned these things, but it was a little bit contradictory to what I said. So when we come back in the future, I'll talk more about where we're going next slide please. Overall, this is as of last week, as of Friday, our ratios in K8, so one teacher to 24 students as far as the caseload goes. And then 912 is 1 to 31. That fluctuates. Again, those are averages. That means of course some Folks have less than that, some folks have more than that. But the caseload number is a topic of conversation since I've been here. And so I wanted to share with you where we're at right now. And then in our specialized supports, you can see 1 to 11, 1 to 12, 1 to 10. At Pioneer, our student to teacher ratio, just teacher. There's other support to Pioneer right now is 1 to 5.

start time: 598:09:30.000
end time: 598:18:42.000
confidence: 0.98
B: And then our.

start time: 598:19:06.000
end time: 606:59:06.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Community transition program is 1 to 21. And our CBO charter and all put together is about 1 to 24. So we are pretty robustly staffed with teacher to student case managers. So these are not. That doesn't mean the students with those teachers all day, it just. This is their caseloads and the IEP case managers do provide the special education services. But, but, but the students will be in and amongst, you know, other classes in the school.

start time: 607:01:38.000
end time: 611:26:44.000
confidence: 0.96
B: So just really quick. So I mean, this is basically just saying. Yeah, so like in a K through 8, each teacher would have 24 cases. Right? And that's considered. Is there like a threshold for what's considered like a healthy.

start time: 611:28:52.000
end time: 620:02:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: So we staff our core program model for PPS for learning center is we staff it at 1 to 28. And so our average right now across K8 is 1 to 24. So we initially stacked for 128, but we're at 1 to 24 right now. So high school is 1 to 30, and we're a little over where we want to be right now on average. So we're going through and balancing some things out, which is what we do in September every single year.

start time: 620:17:10.000
end time: 624:22:28.000
confidence: 0.94
F: Learning center means there's a center where sometimes those children are there, but often they're in another classroom. And the teacher is responsible for. For seeing where all those 24 people are during the day.

start time: 624:23:24.000
end time: 624:31:48.000
confidence: 0.89
E: Correct.

start time: 624:33:24.000
end time: 624:46:00.000
confidence: 0.82
F: Okay.

start time: 625:19:40.000
end time: 640:29:00.000
confidence: 0.95
E: So overall. Next slide, please. Overall, PPS does pretty well in relationship to ensuring students are participating in general education core classes. So over 80% of our students spend over 80% of their day in Gen Y, which is a major in special education. It's something that all districts are assessed on and then compared against. And this is pretty uncommon. You would find in most districts it's not 80%, it's 60% or below 50 to 70. So we've done a very good job and we continue to focus on that. But it's something we should be proud of in the sense of achieve something other places haven't been able to achieve yet. And at the same time, you know, we always try to ensure we're serving students In a way they can benefit.

start time: 640:37:20.000

B: So it's okay. I'm trying to figure out the graph real quick.

start time: 644:04:00.000
end time: 646:14:18.000
confidence: 0.94
E: The big blue is the percentage of students 80% or more. The next group is 40 to 70, which is the dark grayish blue. Yeah.

start time: 646:14:34.000
end time: 648:09:14.000
confidence: 0.96
B: I think the confusing part was like about 80% of the kids are in 80%. Nice coincidence.

D: There I am.

start time: 648:31:46.000
end time: 672:01:22.000
confidence: 0.94
E: I hear you. Especially jargon. It really is so. Next slide. So overarchingly what we know, and this is. This is like researched and settled. So in the law of education or in the. In education law, not actual law. You know, in educational research we know the more time students with disabilities spend in the general education classroom, the higher performance they're going to have in reading and writing, math, the more they're going to attend school, the fewer disruptive behaviors are going to come and the better outcomes after school. We know that. That's proven. It's not argument. We also know that this is the same regardless of disability label, regardless of difficulty or disability severity, regardless of gender and regardless socioeconomic status. This is settled research. Next slide please. We also know that there hasn't been a study conducted since the 1970s that has identified that students with intellectual and other developmental disabilities educated outside of the general education classroom do better in any way. They don't develop more skills, they don't have more successful connections to career and or independent living than they would as if they were in a general education classroom. I don't know if that made sense.

B: Yeah.

start time: 672:26:50.000
end time: 675:45:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Basically in summary, pulling students out and segregating them into in depth classrooms to have their needs met differently does not benefit them at all. We know that and it's settled. Educational research.

And how they play together and all sorts of different disabilities. But all physical. That was interesting to me. She found it to be free. Not to be the only one.

E: I hear you. In special education, the first half of my career I spent a significant amount of time talking to families about how students needs could best be met in a different place than this than the general education classroom. And through that very same time period I learned that wasn't supported and so I think that sometimes the programs are created because of what we think is right. And consequently, what I would ask about that, because I hear what that individual is saying, is what are the conditions within that climate that created it so that I wasn't feeling connected or feel like they belonged. And so it's the. In some senses there's also the component of celebration of disability and identifying that there's difference. And difference is okay. And so. But I hear you and I know and I've seen that experience and I've even contributed to it. And you know, over time I learned that wasn't the way that we needed to do it. And so we look at why are we creating that and try to address it. So over the course of the last couple years, we've engaged in a couple program reviews and you'll start to hear about these more as we move forward. One of them was done by the Urban Special Education Collaborative. We had them come in. I'm going to share some results of what they shared with us. But we had them come in and meet with our staff, visit our classrooms, visit our students, visit with our parents and give us an understanding and an assessment as to how our program was functioning. Urban Special Education Collaborative, it's a membership of 150 urban school districts across the state that the state, not the country. And PBS is a number. And so they came and did that. The other thing, the other group that we had come in was the, it's called Public Consulting Group. They're another big player in special education across the country. And they specifically looked at our adaptive PE program. So why did we do that? You need to go a couple of centers.

E: Why do we do that? Because even though we have very positive data related to the amount of time students are spending in general education classrooms, we're not seeing the achievement outcomes that we want to see. And so we have to ask ourselves, okay, we're operating in a manner that we should be based on research. What is it that's happening that we need to do to better support our students? And so, and then in order also to become as aligned and ensure that students disabilities are served in the same manner that they all other students are through our high quality evidence based research, instructional materials, structural framework and our professional learning. So overall, next slide please. And I'll go through this really quick. But it was ensuring that students with disabilities are provided the same access to curriculum materials as every other student, making sure that we are providing something called universal Design for learning. And that's something we're picking up and moving forward this year as part of our instructional framework work. Universal design for learning is really complicated, but I'll simplify it. It's about. It's a way of planning for teachers to ensure that all students have a way to produce learning and knowing and understanding each individual student's way of doing that. And then providing and ensuring students and principals have professional development in what special education is and what it needs to be and look like within our schools, and then ensuring engagement opportunities for families. The biggest lift is this concept and I mentioned it to begin with and I'll talk more about it moving forward with this idea that students attend their neighborhood schools and not go or be placed in a specialized program that's across town. It's work being done across the country and it's work hugely emphasized in special education circles. And the Urban collaborative identified specifically that we need to do that differently. And the reason is, is because the two things I emphasize hugely, which is the research that says it doesn't work. And so that's a component. And it's not that it doesn't work. People are working really hard for kids, really hard every single day. It's just that it doesn't result in outcomes that we thought it would. So we need to make a shift there. So. And then just ensuring all of our processes and guidelines and data are aligned. So we took these program reviews. They actually did not happen last school year. They happened the year before. And then we spent a year talking to stakeholders. So we talked to parents, we talked to kids, we talked to staff, talked to principals, we talked to community members, all related to these program reviews, getting input and feedback from them on ultimately what we're going to do moving forward. So, Carolina, excellent. I apologize. Yeah. So in overarching, just some themes, both staff, students, families, everybody's excited about this idea. What I'm talking about with neighborhood school model folks feel that students, all students, would benefit from understanding the needs of children who experience disability and start to confront this. Ableism is a term, I don't know if you've heard that. The idea that we need to fix disability basically and start to tear that down, basically, take that view, take that fence down in staff, same thing, principal, same things. Want to make sure that everybody has a voice. And we're very intentional with what we're doing and including kids and ensuring that they're part of the process. But overarchingly, what the program review said, what our staff said, what our students Said what our community says is all on the line and we just need to. And we've started the process of moving forward with that.

confidence: 0.95
E: Next slide, please, please. And so what we want to be true is students with disabilities are included in their accessing high quality instructional practices. They're accessing grade level standards with other students and our teachers are receiving professional learning that is as part of and included as every other teacher. And then in addition to that, additional resource support related to how to serve students. And that is what's going to impact our outcomes for our students with disability. Next slide. So I'll answer any questions. And as part of this, what I was hoping to be able to do was next time bring the so what are we doing about it? Part which is another.

start time: 814:13:54.000
end time: 815:05:10.000

confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, huge. Because I mean, when the, you know, one of my journeys as a teacher. Right. Was that, you know, I have always taught in schools with high levels of high proportions of students with IEPs. And, and there was a, there's. I remember a point in my practice where I was trying to figure out how to accommodate within my classroom all these IEPs and everything that. And what actually turned out was just my teaching became better. It was just better, you know, best practices. Right. This works for everybody. And, and so like if, if there's a way to show more people how to do this or, or to, to progress, you know, especially I'm really interested in like what kind of trainings or professional development development we're offering to teachers. But yeah, I mean it's just, it's a win, win for everybody. So I'm very excited to hear all this.

start time: 830:20:08.000
end time: 843:28:20.000
confidence: 0.90
F: Yeah, I, I second that. I can remember child who was hearing impaired. And I should have thought of this before, but I just wrote the whole schedule on the board. Of course, everybody, all my visual learners did big things, but I must say I always had support. I had an interpreter when I had a child with autism, which was very disruptive. I ended up getting somebody in there to be her aid. So I really hope we're also getting support for our teachers because if you have support in the classroom, then it's actually easy. If you don't, it can be really, really hard.

start time: 843:45:20.000
end time: 844:16:20.000

start time: 844:22:40.000
end time: 858:58:42.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Yeah, I didn't have that specific included what our overall staff to student ratios look like, what we staff students who generate meetings that are on the autism spectrum. What we could potentially do to support them across our system. As far as adults to students, there's other strategies that we want to make sure that we're implementing because students that engage in that productive struggle and even experience a little bit of discomfort even though they're have disabilities are far more likely to become independent or have some level of independence if they have to engage in that without adult support versus if we support and then make them dependent upon it. But I know that's not exactly what you're asking, but I can give all that information to you.

B: One question about the previous slide. It's number. Slide number eight. So I'll show that. So slide number eight. It shows the percentage of total students with iep and then it breaks it down by. Yeah, demographics. Here's a scientist. I mean, coming out, there's a percentage of the total. But if we want to look at for disparities in the. If there's any disparities in the demographics, it would be percentage of that group. Right. So like, what percent of the Asian group is ip and I guess is there. Do we have data on that?

start time: 873:18:40.000
end time: 876:49:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: One thing I would. If. If there is a disparity, I would be concerned about, you know, like access to ip, for example, like, is just making sure that's. That's not an issue. Right. Or if it is an issue, we're addressing it.

end time: 883:18:48.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Like, for example, if. If there's a lower percentage of disadvantage, you know, because the scientific, you know, assumptions, like every demographic is the same percentage of people neurodiverse or whatever needs accommodations. And if there's some. Some groups are a lower percentage than others, it may be an access problem.

confidence: 0.93
C: Yeah, absolutely. And you know, as we look at even continuing our conversations about graduation and graduation requirements, that we're including special education, you know, as a part of the comprehensive conversation. And we could continue the conversation, special education again, to share next time the plan. And we share with you what we found, what we're working towards and how we're. The actual. How if we're going to move forward. We could definitely present next time as we transition.

start time: 904:02:40.000
end time: 913:30:50.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Another question. I mean, you were there too Friday night for the. Or Thursday night for the graduation of the summer school graduates. And I'm just curious, I wonder what percentage of those people had been through in special ed. And it was such a heartwarming thing to see. People obviously had to struggle to make it and how much a special ed helps them through. I mean, obviously I. But I imagine there were quite a.

start time: 913:38:30.000
end time: 934:33:20.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Absolutely, you know, definitely look at that. But you know, as you could see, there is a benefit from ensuring that we have the programming necessary to meet multiple needs that our students have and to offer the program made that when the not just meet them at the knee, but also stretch and excel them so that they can achieve at the best and highest levels. So as we transition. Yeah, we could move forward in our conversation. We were going to next have a conversation about assessments and equitable, equitable grading practices. I think because grades is only one form of an assessment, a way of assessing. I think we could talk about assessment as a. As a larger umbrella first. And then so we're going to bring up the slides for the presentation that Dr. Bernard Adams is going to take us through.

start time: 935:15:40.000
end time: 997:42:18.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Okay. So thank you for the opportunity, Dr. Proctor and Chair Wong. I wanted to just share a little bit about our approach to creating a balanced assessment system. And so, you know, welcome any questions you might have. Want to start with this idea of alignment. To really get a student achievement, three things need to be in tight alignment. And that's the written curriculum, the taught curriculum, and the assessed curriculum. And of course, my team only deals with one part that assessed curriculum. But thankfully, I think it's a benefit that I'm also an educator, so I've been in the teaching trenches and understand those other two areas as well. But what we want to understand and ensure is that our assessments are giving us clear and accurate pictures of student learning. Kara, if I could have the next slide. Assessment is connected deeply to our instructional framework. Our instructional framework has four pillars, as I would call them. And the fourth pillar is data driven and seen there by our graphic and then a picture from a page in the framework. And it's really about the idea that we use both quantitative and qualitative sources, multiple sources to collect, and we collect those sources and we analyze them and we disaggregate them by race in order to improve teaching and learning outcomes both in the classroom, in the school, across an area, and throughout the entire district. Erika, the next slide. We have some guiding principles that Sort of bucket our work in the assessment office. First, we think there must be a clear purpose for the assessments. We want people to understand why they're providing an assessment. The ultimate is when students can tell you why they're taking an assessment is really the ultimate goal there. We want the value of that assessment to exceed the instructional time that you lose. Because, you know, especially when you're giving a standardized assessment, you're taking time away from instruction. And we have, I would argue, the smallest standardized instructional blueprint in Oregon. We have a really tiny blueprint around that we're not wasting valuable time or taking valuable time away from teachers. We don't want the mechanics to impact the value. Sometimes I've lived in previous life instances where we were implementing a new assessment and it just took a while to get it to work technically. And that really turned people off because it was a burden to make it happen. And then it didn't matter how useful or not the results were because it impacted the mechanics that impacted the value. And finally, we want our assessments to be fair and support our equity work. They need to show us where we're doing well with students and groups of students and show us where we're not doing as well so we know where we need to focus more intensely and targeted towards student outcomes and continuous improvement. Care if I could have the next slide? All right, so this is a graphic representation of our assessment system. One, we know, starting at the top, that assessments live on this continuum. For more qualitative, where you get rich information to more quantitative, where you get scores, numbers, and percentiles. We also know, going to the bottom of the graphic, that there's a continuum from formative assessments. So is the assessment in time to allow the teacher to adjust his or their instruction, or is it more summative? And so it tells us this is what happened, but there really isn't chance to go back and do anything about it right now.

start time: 997:43:14.000
end time: 997:46:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Right.

start time: 997:47:30.000
end time: 1067:28:54.000
confidence: 0.95
D: It's already happened. And the kids have moved, the students have moved on. And so we also create this graphic where the width of the rectangle is proportionately the amount of time we would hope that teachers in school would spend in each assessment area. So I'll start with the green. That's daily planning and instruction, the formative assessment process that our teachers use. These are student assignments and work products. They also include our screeners and our diagnostics. In addition to that, we have our curriculum embedded assessments in yellow. We've made good on the voters voting in the bond around our curricular resources, and we are Adopting those curricular resources. And we expect that our teachers will use those curriculum embedded assessments because those are closest to instruction to inform and make adjustments. Then as we get to the red and the blue or that might look a little purple navy boxes, we have the PRE act our MAP assessments and I have them separated from SAT and OSAs only because they happen in the first semester. So technically you get PRE act results and you could attempt to intervene during the second semester of the school year. But by the time students have taken SAT and OSAs, by the time we get those results, those students have moved on to the next grade. And so that's why those are furthest to the right. And then this year we are. If you can go to the next slide, Kara. We are working with our school based instructional coaches who in turn will work with their teacher teams and their principal to really unpack and make living this idea of student learning analysis which really will happen with the information between the green and the yellow rectangles in our system and model. My particular belief is that if we focus on the formative assessment process and use formative assessments and curriculum embedded assessments to make adjustments for student learning and growth, the state test math, everything else will take care of itself because we really use the most rich information that's closest to the student and closest to the teacher. The last slide is just where do you find more information if you want to go and double and triple click. We have assessment calendars that outline the assessments that are required. Those include our state, our statewide and district adopted standardized assessments. And those are only statewide is OSAS district adopted. We have math in grades three through eight and the SAT in grade 11. And then what our curriculum vetted assessments are that we want teachers to use in order to drive their instruction. We also in addition and you'll the full board will hear about this. As a part of our Update on Division 22 requirements, we're also required to identify local performance assessments in the curriculum by which students will demonstrate their mathematics skills, their reading skills or speaking and their writing skills. And what we've been able to do this year that we weren't able to fully do in years past because we didn't have adopted materials in all areas was identified curriculum embedded assessments that could also fulfill the requirement of the local performance assessment. So it's not a second assessment that I have to give at the end of unit three it said I just give the curriculum embedded assessment and it also meets the requirement of the local performance assessment as established by ode. So wherever we can, you know I was a special educator and a teacher and I understand the paperwork burden like our special educators do as well. Whenever we can, we want to make sure we're really not expanding teacher workload and shrinking it where we can, or at least in this instance, keeping it the same.

confidence: 0.93
B: I feel like a lot of it's going to be addressed in future and. Sure. Presentations. Yeah. And we're talking about assessments. We're talking more just like the other conversation we're getting into is equitable grading and that stuff. Right. And this assessment is more just like the MAP tests also, you know, I assume in the core classes in terms of like keeping up to efficiencies. Right.

start time: 1081:06:12.000
end time: 1090:49:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I'm thinking like term papers, biology labs, when we're in that green box, written responses to mathematic problems and things like that, writing samples. So when I think of assessment, I think of the Latin root word which means to sit beside. And so I'm assessing Joanne. I'm sitting beside and working with her or watching her work in order to understand where she is performing. So mostly what we want to think about is that richness that happens inside of the classroom that isn't necessarily a standardized assessment.

start time: 1090:51:50.000
end time: 1092:18:08.000

confidence: 0.93
C: Those are the day to day grades. You know, they are assessed in a way that they produce a grade sometimes, but other measures that teachers can use. And so the distinction on that spectrum between in the green, what is formative assessments versus our map, Our oaths tend to fall into. Into the summative. The formative assessment is what teachers can use out of the day to day instruction to inform. That's how I think of formative assessment, to inform my planning, my future instruction. Where I need to reteach, where I need to pull Patti and Eddie to the side to ensure that they truly understand. Yeah. And those that side by side, that regular interval of understanding how the learning within a child is progressing is part of what we call assessments.

end time: 1119:33:20.000
confidence: 0.94
D: In my previous district, I was in charge of grading and reporting. And what we would always talk about is grades should be based on a body of evidence. That evidence is the evidence of the various assessments that the teacher has used throughout their term or the unit or the quarter or the semester to determine if students have mastered the content and met the standard.

start time: 1131:20:14.000
end time: 1133:46:46.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Yeah, this one. So like, I feel like there's. There's a separation between. I mean, with assessments it's necessary to find the purpose.

start time: 1133:47:18.000
end time: 1133:48:54.000
confidence: 0.89
E: Right.

start time: 1133:49:02.000
end time: 1135:54:50.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I mean, I feel like the ideal assessment is something. It's a tool that students can use to increase engagement as well, is like track their own growth.

start time: 1135:55:30.000
end time: 1135:58:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Right.

start time: 1135:59:30.000
end time: 1140:21:30.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I mean, that's the ideal assessment. And that would be the purpose of like, hopefully the purpose of like the. The thing you outlined in blue. But I like what you said about like defining purpose as well, because I feel like. Is it like map testing is a different purpose? Right. It's for the district to figure out where our holes. Right?

start time: 1140:22:10.000

E: Yes.

start time: 1140:34:50.000
end time: 1144:40:51.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And so I think maybe that part in terms of communication. I can't talk anymore. Communication ting, like the purpose. I think there's some confusion about that part is with the sense I'm getting from like community and things like that.

start time: 1144:42:35.000

start time: 1145:08:11.000
end time: 1151:48:05.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Sure. No, we can never do enough communication. In my experience. We cannot. We cannot over communicate. And I know that there have been questions around map assessment and what the purpose of it. And to your point, I always say we're trying to make sure students are growing for every year they're with us. And where we have. To your point, gas that we need to really address.

D: Isn't to inform student grades or teachers instruction. It's really for us to understand what is a common measure we have at third grade, at seventh grade, in math, in English language arts, where we can see across the district how things appear to be going and where there appears to be a concern. We can move in and do further investigation to understand what the concern really is and might be.

B: And then the last question I have is this might be going into the next part, but I'm just curious about is there like in terms of trying to improve our assessment practices, is there already professional development and stuff embedded already? Coaches are working with teachers or principals in terms of improving our best practices.

start time: 1166:51:10.000
end time: 1174:40:38.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Coaches will be working with teachers and with coaches with their principals will be providing professional learning support to their teachers around the entire unit planning cycle. From understanding your unit backwards, mapping it, unpacking it, to assessing student learning in the unit. So we'll be doing a cycle of those learnings throughout the school year with teachers. In terms of professional learning in all.

D: The protocols that are being developed are subject and content agnostic. Right. So it doesn't. The idea will be that there are certain steps you go when you unpack your unit. The materials I have might be a little bit different than Philippe's materials, but there's still steps that both Philippe and I take. Even though I might be teaching third grade ELA and he's teaching high school algebra, there's still steps that we need to take that are very similar.

C: Which is how is it that. That we are looking at daily instruction and daily assessments. And then those daily assessments, what do they produce? You know, and oftentimes they produce grades. But we. But we are in the process of exploration of how we can ensure that grading practices are more balanced in our system. And I'll introduce it by saying that, you know, we want to ensure that if there are. If there is a grading practice at one school, that the grading practice is consistent so that a student doesn't have a different experience based on what school they attend. Likewise, within the school that if a student is taking an English class, English one with Ms. Calvert, and then another student is taking English one, you know, with Ms. Proctor, that their grading outcomes would be different based on a different practice in each classroom. So the team is going to now present to you what we call equitable grading. And the slide is available in board book. And we want to introduce what we are currently exploring. So there is no policy change, there is no district wide practice in this endeavor. It is a conversation that we're having with a number of educators and schools who are engaging in an exploration with us. So I will turn it over to.

end time: 1253:52:10.000
confidence: 0.96
G: So I think that's a, that's a perfect way to segue into this conversation. And I'll just kick us off by saying that as we continue to learn about equitable grading practices, as we continue to explore, the key question that we can go to the next slide is how might this practice help us further our commitment to achieving educational equity, specifically in terms of raising the achievement of all our students and reducing the racial achievement and opportunity gap. With everything that we do, we want to make sure that we're moving closer towards reaching our educational why, which is the educational equity in our school district. Next slide. So this afternoon we'll talk a little bit about what are the shifts in grading the equitable grading practices are calling for? How might this align? How is this already aligning with some of our existing initiatives? What is currently happening in our school buildings? What are our plans moving forward? And we want to make sure that we have time for any questions. Next slide.

start time: 1254:31:20.000
end time: 1271:43:08.000
confidence: 0.95
A: All right, thank you. So we'd like to share a little bit more about those key shifts to equitable grading. And this can be found in more detail in that link there to equitable grading practices on the continuum. And so just to share a little bit about each of these, I think that opening by Dr. Proctor, it just really hits the. Hits the piece here on mathematically sound scales. So two teachers teaching students. Let's think of two students in two different classrooms, right? Let's say they have the same mastery and yet potentially without these practices, they may be receiving different grades. And so the shift really is arriving at those sound, durable practices where students would experience similar outcomes in their grading. The performance standards really are intending to show a student's progress toward a standard within the gradebook. Rubrics really are intended to unveil what we're asking students to do. What is it that we're wanting them to learn? How will a student know when they're successful?

start time: 1271:46:04.000
end time: 1271:58:00.000
confidence: 0.73
C: Right.

start time: 1272:03:00.000
end time: 1279:16:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: And then mitigating those non academic factors, oftentimes in a traditional grade book, we may see things like participation, we may see behavior, we may see attendance. So when we make that shift, equitable rating, there really is not room for that. When we're really reporting out specifically on the progress towards sound toward standards.

start time: 1279:17:30.000
end time: 1279:27:50.000
confidence: 0.56
C: Right.

start time: 1279:34:10.000
end time: 1300:57:56.000
confidence: 0.94
A: When we eliminate those bias resistance practice, bias resistant practices, these can be things like extra credit. The example that's often used in training is the teacher giving extra credit for Philippe bringing tissue boxes into the classroom. Well, what if I couldn't afford tissue boxes to bring into my classroom? Then I wouldn't get that extra mark in the gradebook. Right? So that's an example. And then providing multiple opportunities to demonstrate proficiency. Sometimes this is one that is a little bit hard for teachers at first when they see this because they first think oh, I need to provide multiple assessments or I need to test students multiple times. And over time, as we've learned more about this, it's actually just providing the same say test, test question multiple times where if a student doesn't get it the first time, but they, let's say on a quiz, but then later on in the chapter assessment, they nail it, their grade can reflect mastery. Right. Opposed to that first time around on an assessment. And then normalizing feedback to include multiple opportunities for, for student self assessment. This is really talking about the culture of the taxrome. The culture of the classroom is one where maybe even us as peers, Philippe and I are giving each other feedback.

start time: 1300:59:48.000
end time: 1301:03:32.000
confidence: 0.80
C: Right?

start time: 1301:03:56.000
end time: 1327:48:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Well then when the teacher goes to give feedback, this is a comfortable norm that we are, we are grading in a way that's giving feedback and progress again toward those standards. Use of a standards based or competency based grading model, ultimately to arrive at this fully 100%, the gradebook would also be reflective of these standards. So when you look at a standards based gradebook compared to a traditional gradebook, traditional gradebook may have certain scales for certain things, quizzes may have a certain scale, homework may have a certain scale, so on and so forth. Whereas that standards based report card is going to have a four point scale specific to each standard. That's the big shift there. And then really calculating grades ultimately for that final grade for, for the class is completely reflective of a student's proficiency. And so those are really the key shifts to equitable grading. This next slide shows a quick comparison of a traditional grading system compared to that standards based grading system. So just highlight some of those comparisons again where maybe it was based on a percentage system, something like that, opposed to really aligned to those performance standards in grade. That's a quick overview of the shifts when we move to an equity based grading system.

start time: 1328:13:00.000
end time: 1342:50:30.000
confidence: 0.95
G: So equitable grading practices are called out as one of the initiatives in the middle school redesign as well as the high school success plan and are also included in our instructional framework in our ongoing commitment to make sure that educators are providing meaningful feedback to students. And that in much the same way that we want to ensure that our curriculum is standards aligned, that our instruction is standards Aligned. We also want to make sure that our assessment is standards aligned and free of much of the bias that Joanne talked about. So this is not a tangential initiative. It is very much embedded in some of the core work that our middle schools and high schools are engaging in.

start time: 1342:59:30.000
end time: 1343:15:10.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Next slide.

start time: 1343:50:10.000
end time: 1347:02:40.000
confidence: 0.89
G: We can skip through the next two slides. You can see where equitable creating practices are called out. So the question is, where are we today? And I think Margaret will talk about that one.

start time: 1347:13:00.000
end time: 1357:15:20.000
confidence: 0.95
H: So grading practices have been a conversation for just about forever, I would say. Right. And so part of what we're seeing is this is an ongoing body of work and discussion. It's gone through various forms. You hear standards based grading. You hear proficiency based grading. You hear there is a lot of work done by Diane Smith around proficiency based grading over a number of years. And ultimately all of it is about how do we communicate with students about their progress and families.

start time: 1357:16:40.000
end time: 1357:20:40.000
confidence: 0.68
C: Right.

start time: 1357:21:20.000
end time: 1437:04:20.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Like that's. Ultimately, grading is all about communication. So part of what we've done recently, and coming out of the pandemic, you know, when we went to online learning, there's a real challenge to saying, how do we get to know what students know in this new environment? Right. And so I think that in the last few years, this is. We've seen equitable grading sort of surface in a number of ways. It really came from conversations with educators and with their administrators and how do we do this in this particular context and provide really good information back to students about their progress? And then we also started to look at, there are some areas that we've seen this. Some of these shifts happen. So our. If we look in the sort of. In 2122, we had some content areas that were really looking specific content areas that we're looking at. How do you shift some of the grading practices? So our science teams really had a long conversation about what does that look like? How do you surface an opportunity for students to demonstrate understanding in science classrooms? How is that tied to what standards are learning? How do you know which spaces and places students are showing proficiencies and have strengths, and what are areas that we can focus and support them in their learning? I think the other piece that happened in the 2122 school year, our secondary administrators and many of our administrators went through some collaborative work during our leadership sessions to really think about how this is showing up consistently, not only across our system, but within school sites. So we're seeing this kind of happen in both levels, some from the ground level, really in classrooms and at buildings, and then also across the district in our central office, we see a lot of individual school sites engaged in book studies or professional learning. That this really became a robust conversation spurred in much coming out of the pandemic. In particular in the last school year, we also have had educator professional learning during cadres and on professional learning days that looked at the tenets of what it means to really have a robust and internally consistent grading practices. And then there are a number of schools said, okay, let's have, let's see how we can foster this and bring it forward. So if we could go to the next slide, please. So there are a couple places that we're seeing some really promising practices. In the spring of last year, about 39% of middle school principals reported to having one type or more. The tenants or principals of equitable grading in operation in their schools. Mount Tabor, Hoffer and Kellogg, for example, are doing some things school wide, while Astor, Fabian, Sunnyside and Vernon are partially implementing. And I went back and had a conversation with Principal Longo from Mount Tabor and said, so what does that look like to do something school wide? And what were the specific parts of equitable grading that you're focusing on? So they were focusing on a four point scale that that would be consistent in all classrooms. They are also looking at opportunities for students to demonstrate learning multiple times, for example, so that if there is an opportunity to take an assessment or to write a paper, that there are opportunities for revision and improvement. So those are a couple of the examples that she gave. And then we also see that at certain schools and the high schools in particular, we see the end specific teams of teachers that are working on it and really thinking about what are the practices. And similarly we're seeing connection to specific standards that you're seeing some type of a rubric that is associated with it, a scale that is not 100 points. Some schools are using seven point scales, others are using four. But then this idea that students should have multiple opportunities to demonstrate their understanding that it's not just sort of one of them. So those are some, some pieces. And as Dr. Proctor said up front, we're exploring some of these. We're looking at promising practices. And then how do we formalize this into some guidelines that we can use across the district to reduce the variability that students are experiencing not only within school sites, but across school sites.

start time: 1437:26:00.000
end time: 1439:26:24.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I also do want to add that for equitable grading practices, there's a student component that we have to always consider.

start time: 1439:27:52.000
end time: 1443:56:32.000
confidence: 0.94
I: Especially when we're dealing with our second language learners and our special ed students. So if you're using a rubric, for example, you've got to look at the content for each of the descriptors in that rubric to see what will equate the level of performance for student who.

start time: 1443:56:56.000
end time: 1444:21:36.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Is not in those programs.

start time: 1444:23:28.000
end time: 1449:21:04.000
confidence: 0.92
I: So if you're requesting that students write a five paragraph essay, maybe for the special ed student or for ESL student, it might be shorter, as long as it has all the components that you require to have, because they're still in, they are still in the phase of language development.

start time: 1449:23:52.000
end time: 1449:33:20.000
confidence: 0.85
E: Right.

start time: 1449:35:20.000
end time: 1459:42:10.000
confidence: 0.94
I: Or you also have to also consider what skills the student has brought into the classroom. Because based on the skills that the student brings into the classroom, then you can say this is what mastery looks like. And if this is what mastery looks like and this is the skills the child has, what can we consider to equate equity leading up to mastery for this particular student? Because not all the students are going to thrive based on the rubrics that you create. And those rubrics have to be adaptable to the needs of the kids, especially when they come in with specialized areas of concern or areas that we need to address.

start time: 1459:52:30.000
end time: 1461:44:22.000
confidence: 0.94
B: That gets a lot into the debate with grades based on proficiencies versus based on growth.

start time: 1461:46:06.000
end time: 1462:24:10.000
confidence: 0.71
I: Absolutely right. Absolutely.

start time: 1462:57:50.000
end time: 1463:37:42.000
confidence: 0.47
B: Conundrum, yes.

start time: 1463:38:46.000
end time: 1469:22:08.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So how would you say that then? Because it's a different proficiency, good proficiency for someone coming in with that beginning, eventually want to help that person go even further. So what, how exactly?

start time: 1469:25:04.000
end time: 1490:35:30.000
confidence: 0.95
I: That's why the descriptors that go into the different aspects of the grade scale matter a lot. Because then you're actually looking at content mastery as opposed to just a little box, Right? And then based on the content mastery that you're striving for, you're also looking at the skill sets that the child already has to measure them towards that content mastery. So I may require, you know, years ago, when we're in the classroom, they tell you to write a paragraph with five sentences, right? Well, maybe what you want to do is have the student write a paragraph that's maybe a little bit longer or a little bit shorter, depending on their skill set. Or they might even speak it into a reporter. And then what you look at is you look at the content. Do they link the sentences? Are the sentences sophisticated? You know, do they use all simple sentences? So there are so many ways to look at the ability of that student relative to every single graded practices. And I'll be looking at that in terms of what the student is able to do versus what the rest of the class is able to do using the Rubrics. Right. As long as I can get the same content and the same quality from that, even if it's a shorter piece.

start time: 1490:43:50.000
end time: 1492:46:50.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Yeah, I understand that. But you also eventually want to help that child reach.

start time: 1492:55:50.000
end time: 1493:03:42.000
confidence: 0.64
I: Yes.

start time: 1493:04:46.000
end time: 1493:27:26.000

F: The total mastery.

start time: 1493:30:38.000
end time: 1493:43:30.000

H: Yeah.

start time: 1493:53:10.000
end time: 1494:16:10.000
confidence: 0.92
C: So as we continue.

start time: 1494:49:30.000
end time: 1522:59:54.000
confidence: 0.96
G: I can just offer perhaps in a traditional classroom, in a traditional system, when students are assessed, that grade sticks with them for the rest of the semester. And the growth that they experience following that assessment is not taken into account. In this system, we privilege and center growth over. When students demonstrate that growth, we document where they are in their progression using we assess. But we celebrate their achievement, their ultimate achievement. And so that's a real benefit of a system like this. So as I think Margaret will always be Margaret for me. So the hope is to move away from a space where there are multiple scales, multiple reporting mechanisms, multiple factors taken into account when assessing students and really move into a standardized, equitable system of assessing that is more accurate, unbiased, and ultimately motivating for students. Where students understand that I know what is the target that I'm trying to achieve. I know that I'll have time and support to get there. And so students take more ownership of their educational experience. They don't feel like their grades. They can be in charge of their learning. They're partners in the process rather than being subjects who are graded by grownups. And so maybe just a little bit in the closing minutes about our plans moving forward.

C: I was very glad to be here. Oh, good. Yes, I can enjoy the very, very engaged. My name is Sylvia Hart Landsberg, as I said, and I'm with the War Resisters League. And I'll. I'll cut to the chase, but then back up a little bit about what we're about. One of our practical reasons for being here is we want to follow and be involved in any discussions the district has at any level where we can do that about Junior rotc, the ROTC possibilities. And I heard really clearly that it's just an investigation at this point. You said totally, so we're not jumping into any conclusions either. So I would like to know about dates and times and locations of meetings. And thank you for the information and who, who is on the committee and we. So I will just give you my email as a start to.

end time: 1601:56:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Would I give that to you, Karen? Okay. Okay. That's right. So the War Resisters League is interested in helping the students understand the military recruiters information in a wider context. We're of course, obviously emphasizing peace and peace education. And we try to help the students understand some of the military's messages with regard to their classroom lessons in literacy, history, global politics and the environment, and to make choices, realizing that that message the military gives so strongly is just a fraction of what they need to be looking at with every career decision. And some of our activities, not all, are a program we call Recruiter Watch in which we go into the high schools. Recruiters come in and offer this kind of information. So I'm satisfied. But how shall I proceed? What should I do next so that we stay LinkedIn and the people that we work with. Stay LinkedIn.

J: Hello everyone. My name is Karanja Cruz. C R E W S. For the record, I am a current CBRC member. Also on the site council for both of my children's school. Excuse me for one second. I'm also a member of the face, which is the Family Advisory Council on Education, which is derived from the great work of Dr. Armstrong. Shout out to Dr. Armstrong. I'm also a vendor of PPS where I provide professional development service for educators through the Teacher with Purpose conference which is coming up October 13th. Hoped to soon be working with Dr. Proctor in a more comprehensive direction where we provided professional development for our educators. I have a few questions. As an educator and a parent, one of my major concerns I've been addressing for the for a few years now, now is that when my kids were in elementary school, they were receiving exceedings for their grades. In the current grading report card that we have for the district for elementary, when they arrived to middle school, they were receiving A's, but still they were not passing the state standardized test. So even in elementary school and also in middle school, now we're starting high school. So I'm just curious about the alignment of the current grading system that we have. Is it aligned with the standardized assessment that our kids are are taking? And I'm just trying to figure out the alignment piece. So I have a lot of questions. I plan on to be very engaged with this committee being involved in sharing testimonies, things in that nature. And so I have a lot of questions and then I see that I have 20 seconds left. I also noticed something in the special education presentation that it was 11% of black students in special education. But however there's only eight students, 8% of students, black students in the Portland Public School district. So that's a pretty high number. Also have a question about the assessment calendar. Dr. Adams had mentioned that there are going to be local performance tasks embedded in the current curriculum. I was curious. I went to the calendar, I didn't see any local performance tasks being scheduled. So I'm just curious of when that's going to be taking place within the embedded curriculum assessments. And so yeah, so I just plan on being engaged in this committee, have a lot of questions. Hopefully this work with the board and maybe some staff immersive to get the questions answered. So thank you for your time.
