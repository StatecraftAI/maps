A: Good evening everyone and welcome to tonight's special meeting for April 9, 2024. It is now officially called to order. The agenda for this special meeting is posted on the PPS website under the board and meetings tabs. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website website for replay times. I want to make sure that I let everyone know that tonight Cheryl Hollins and Director Scott will be joining us virtually and Student Director Silverstein is under the under the weather and she won't be joining us at all. The purpose of tonight's meeting is to approve the criteria for the next superintendent for Portland Public Schools and to also discuss the salary range for the superintendent position. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Interim Superintendent Dr. Sandy Husk and allow her to share some reflections and lead us forward.

C: Thank you. Vice Chair Green. I wanted just to take a minute since I've been in the interim role to make some observations about this wonderful district and the unique opportunity you're in and also because I've been a candidate for an interim superintendent once and for a superintendent many, many times, and I thought some of my observations might be helpful to you and to the community. As you know, the decision about choosing the next superintendent is the most important decision that a board makes. And even though we're rightfully focused on the budget right now, I think that using the budget discussions is an opportunity to think about the future and what we want for the future, rather than just staying in what what is it we're dealing with right now? Let's, let's spend some time doing vision. The the budget requires planning and getting a really good superintendent in here, one with a good vision that wants to focus on all the students and make sure that instruction and communications, et cetera, move forward is so important. And in my two months, and probably hopefully for the next three months, what I've observed I'd like to share with you. There's so many strengths in Portland Public Schools. There's a lot of passion here from the community, from board members, from the leaders in the district, leaders in the community. And there's a strong commitment to public education and overall, there is broad community support for schools. What sets PPS apart, in my opinion, from other school district this size nationally, is there's a wide variety of curriculum options, of program options, of choices for parents and students to really lean into their passion of their K12 journey and where they want to go when they exit from high school. It's a very rich curriculum offerings that you all have here. You don't find that in a lot of places, especially in larger semi urban type settings. And I think that's a great pride point. Some of the challenges that I see right now is that we've been through so many upset moments over the past year, yet the trust, transparency, pulling school leaders closer to the central office. They are eager to be empowered and have their voice help lead the system forward. We've got relations to build with union members, with our own employees, with community members who are very much influenced. And then we have the reality of budget shortfalls. What I heard from principals, I had my first full day with them on Friday last week, and of course I'd had lots of individual conversations up till then that they want to see a shift in the culture where they know the operational perspective of where they have autonomy, where they can be contributors and where they can be sense makers. And I know when principals are able to do that for their local community, it will help all employees be able to understand what's going on. And I invited them to lean in and to join the central office as being an important part of decision making. How does this translate into looking for a candidate? I'm going to highlight some of the things that you have in the criteria in front of you. I really think focusing on a collaborator, someone who does a lot of deep listening, problem solving, but really sees this as a community and a group effort. And I can say community of board and superintendent, community of board and administration, somebody who's very visible and engaged. I got quite a few comments of thank you so much for spending this amount of time with us. I think we need to be looking at somebody who really, really wants to be be in Portland is really committed to Portland Public Schools, and I'm confident that the team of advisors here and the board can find that. I also think it needs to be somebody who's a unifier, someone who is willing to say, we've got different perspectives. We may not always agree, we may agree to disagree, but how do we stay together as a respectful community even when we're having challenging dialogue? I think the role of the board is so critical on how you do your work. People are watching these meetings. They want to know that you care deeply about the district and that comes across very strongly. But they also want to know that the board work is effective and organized in a fashion that they can predict after they've received direction from you, that those directions will steer and that they can then implement the policies or the resolutions that have come forward. I think individually, each of you do that all the time. Sometimes I think as a group, we can keep getting a little tighter on our messaging, that, yes, we just had a very rigorous debate. Yes, we all care for each other, and this is the decision that we've come up with, and we can support it as a unit to group. A united group of seven is the way I would put that. So here's my summary. It's been a really challenging past four years, especially challenging last year with too many disruptions. It's a really unique opportunity for a reset. You've got an interim that already knows she's going away, so she can put some things in the room. And I said that to the principals. If you've got things that are hard to say, I'm the one to deliver it to, because sometime in July, I'm driving back over that mountain and I will be over there caring about you, but I won't be over here. This is a really big task. It really is the most important thing that you do. Hiring a superintendent, balancing a budget, demonstrating unity and strength, even with really rigorous debate. I think we can do all of that because our kids need us and the impact of the candidates. I'm really wanting you to have high, high quality candidates and a really good, rigorous process. I tease some of my colleagues that want to be a superintendent, and I say it's a lot like dating. You can go on a lot of dates, you can talk to a lot of boards, but when you decide to take that position, you better be sure that it's a real commitment to being together, because it's a relationship between you and seven individuals who operate as a group. So those are my caring words that I share with you tonight for whatever wisdom that brings. And I'm now going to be an interim superintendent and go home while you have your work in front of you about the next steps. And I will see you at the next executive session. Thank you, Vice Chair Green.

A: Thank you so much, Dr. Husk. We appreciate everything that you're doing with us and all the information that you're sharing with us. It's been very apparent that you are giving us everything that you have to offer. You're not leaving anything on the table. And for that, I want to make sure that we recognize that work and just say thank you again. People don't always have to agree, but we have to value one another for what we're doing, what we believe in and what we're standing for and that is where I sit. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you so very, very much. And I'll be looking for you. I think she put her hand on the button. Ms. Director Brewards would like to also say thank you, I guess.

B: How did you know that? I just wanted to thank you for sharing your wisdom. I've been here through 10 superintendents during my 25 year journey with PPS and a few more if you had my student years. And I think you really touched on many of the things that make PPS a great district and our challenges and so much appreciate your insights into.

B: We should be looking for because we have, I think I'm going to say positive things about the qualifications, but you touched on some things that aren't in the qualifications but are, I think, attributes that will, if we find somebody that has them, be the right fit. So thank you for offering that.

A: We'll see you in a few minutes. I apologize. Thank you. Director Usk, we're now going to move to approving the criteria for selecting the next superintendent for Portland Public Schools. I also want to make sure that I say thank you to everyone who took time to provide your input through the surveys and the focus groups. Those things informed the draft criteria that we're going to be used that we'll be voting on this evening. Now, before voting on the criteria this evening. Evening. The board first reviewed and discussed the criteria on April 2, both in a special meeting and again in the regular board meeting. And so if there is no objection, I would like to get the motion on the floor. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt Resolution 6894, the approval of the superintendent criteria for Portland Public Schools.

start time: 174:00:26.000
end time: 174:43:50.000

start time: 175:21:00.000
end time: 177:48:40.000
confidence: 0.95
A: It was moved by Director Brim Edwards and it was seconded by Director Wong. Is there any board discussion?

start time: 178:10:20.000
end time: 184:43:14.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yes, there were a couple of things that came from the community that I realized we hadn't put on our criteria. And one had to do with someone who would be experienced with special education and having students with disabilities both inside and outside the regular classroom. Not sure exactly how to say it.

start time: 184:43:22.000
end time: 185:18:10.000

start time: 185:18:50.000
end time: 193:07:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: We need to add that also there was no mention of somebody who was experienced with CTE programs and working with industry partners. And and I would like to see that put on. And then there was one small change Suggested to change K12 to pre KD12 since we now have so many pre K classes as well. So those were three things I'd like to see added.

start time: 193:59:00.000
end time: 198:03:14.000
confidence: 0.94
A: If I can just voice back so that I can make sure that you would like to see a mention of SPID, someone who has focus on SPED CTE and change pre K12 to pre K to 12.

start time: 198:04:42.000
end time: 198:09:38.000

D: Right.

start time: 198:10:34.000
end time: 206:59:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Okay. Any other board discussion? I'm going to ask if I get any other board discussion. If not, before I move on to the next piece and ask about was there any public comment I would reach over to. I would say something out loud to my legal counsel, Liz, and say, hey, Liz, is there anything that I need to do with that information that just came across the table? And then she's going to say something legally back.

start time: 207:24:20.000
end time: 208:30:52.000
confidence: 0.98
C: I think your approach of collecting all of the comments at once, seeing if.

start time: 208:31:16.000
end time: 208:57:00.000
confidence: 0.96
E: There'S agreement, then you can move to.

start time: 208:57:40.000
end time: 209:53:32.000

C: Amend the motion in a consolidated fashion.

start time: 209:54:36.000
end time: 210:23:20.000
confidence: 0.99
B: Unless someone objects to that approach.

start time: 210:34:10.000
end time: 214:08:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Excellent, excellent. So thank you so much. But, you know, legal is always better. I'm not going to jail for anybody. Is there any other board discussion?

start time: 214:19:30.000
end time: 238:20:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yes. So, first of all, I want to thank the team for listening. I see I had a fair amount of feedback and comments in addition to the solid foundation that was brought to us. So I appreciate that. I'm seeing in the, in the current criteria many of those items. One thing that I'm not seeing, and maybe I'm just missing it, but, and I'll just put this out there, the having some experience in a, a state with strong labor unions. There's quite a difference across the US for districts where you have labor with who are strong partners and who have significant rights. And I think for me, I'd like to see that in there as somebody has experience in a state similar to it doesn't have to be Oregon, but with strong labor partners. And then the second thing is this is a small thing, but in the fiscal stewardship and advocacy leadership, the experience and policy development, the only thing I would add is before the word advocacy, add effective. Lots of people can advocate, but not everybody's effective.

start time: 239:42:00.000
end time: 240:31:40.000
confidence: 0.90
F: Particularly important for our next leader.

start time: 240:51:20.000

A: Thank you so much. Is there any other board discussion?

start time: 241:59:20.000
end time: 250:37:50.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I was just looking over what Superintendent Husk just mentioned to see if that was included in this draft proposal, because I think she made some really important points, particularly around the collaborative nature of the position and also someone that wants to be in Portland. So, you know, we want a demonstration of someone that wants to be here, maybe for reasons beyond, you know, just the pay and benefits, but actually Wants to be in this community.

confidence: 0.94
G: Okay, I want to first say. I want to say thanks to our interim Dr. Huss. I think the insight that she gave us was very informative and very intuitive of what she has seen here in pps. So I just want to give her a thanks for that. I just want to say I thought the criteria was good. I just want to. I don't know if it's caution or if I want to just put it out there that we don't get too specific to where we, you know, are weeding out candidates. So, for instance, I'm gonna just use this as an example, Patty, Just as an example. Every time we want someone who has experience just with special education, you know, I want to make sure we're not weeding other people out or we're not getting too in the weeds of saying, well, I want people who are special education. Well, I want somebody who has, you know, experience with, you know, our math curriculum, or I want someone who is. Have our curriculum, you know, have experience in our curriculum with reading. I just want to make sure we kind of keep it broad, if we can, without getting too far too specific in actual each program, because each program can say, hey, I want to. I want our program to be listed as part of the criteria. And I don't want us to get too cumbersome, you know, with that. So that's all I would say around that. And then that's with any other thing that is specific as far as somebody want to be important. I don't know how you measure that, and maybe that's up to the experts on how you measure someone's desire to be in Portland. But I just wanted to make sure they could tell this one to try to make sure that we're not getting too specific where, you know, it's. You know, I don't know how to say that. Maybe I'm not saying it right, but I'll leave it at that. Thanks.

end time: 296:21:18.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Thank you, Gary. Director Wong, I see you with your finger on the button. It's on the button. Yeah.

start time: 296:21:34.000
end time: 308:08:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I mean, this question might be more for Human Capital Enterprises, because as this criteria gets longer, to me, it just seems more like a wish list rather than a criteria. Right. I mean to me it's already like a wish list because I can't imagine anyone who could fit all these. But so I guess my point is like when you're using this criteria, right, and what does that look like if you have a candidate who matches what like say a percentage like oh, 80%, are they considered? This is someone to look for or I mean, is that how it's kind of used? I mean I see that it's like sets a direction, but I'm just kind of curious about that.

start time: 309:29:20.000
end time: 312:30:58.000
confidence: 0.83
A: Unmute yourself. Hey, still muted, eh? There you go.

start time: 312:33:14.000
end time: 334:04:10.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Well, that's embarrassing. Better than that. Thank you. Sorry about that. And thank you for the question. Director Wong, I would say a couple things. One is it is, it is a guidepost. It's not a tally. So it's a set of criteria that we are looking for candidates holistically against. I would to the question about getting specifics and I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a very fair thing to raise on both sides of the question. I would say if there is something that the board collectively wants to see in a candidate that is specific, should be there. You've got, you've got pieces around the work around equity that's clearly of high interest to all of you collectively. If you start to take certain pieces and certain specific specifications, you do run as Chair Holland say, you do run the risk of putting out there that maybe a certain candidate will self select out because they don't fall into that specific thing. And so I would say unless the collective board or a great majority of the board identifies a thing, a piece as really a critical element, I would say I would, I would also caution not to get too specific in terms of what that looks like because it looks like a list to candidates and they are going to self select based on what they see.

start time: 334:27:10.000
end time: 346:01:30.000
confidence: 0.96
E: I have a little bit of a follow up question about that. So we know that women and people of color do self select out if they don't meet 100% of the criteria. And to that end, do you have a statement within the job posting that says we understand that people of color and women self select, so we encourage you to apply if you meet 70% or 75% of color. The criteria we don't have. That's asking. I mean I'm seeing that a lot on, I'm seeing that on job listings when organizations understand what the barriers are to hiring strong women or strong people of color candidates.

start time: 346:11:10.000
end time: 347:28:50.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Thank you. Because that was another point I was going to raise, too. So I'm glad you brought it up.

start time: 347:39:10.000
end time: 353:59:40.000
confidence: 0.95
F: We certainly, and I've seen that too, and we certainly can add some language. I've seen some districts nearby Portland that do that habitually. I may or may not want to put an exact percentage in there because that suggests that there's a metric going on that, you know, maybe isn't happening in terms of metrics, but we certainly can. And I think that's a great idea, Director DePass, to add that in.

start time: 354:32:40.000
end time: 362:05:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Thank you. If there be no other board discussion, Ms. Kira, do we have any public comment on this matter? Excellent. Thank you. Now, with that being said, now I'm a volley back to my legal counsel. Ms. Liz, can you say what you said again so that I can say it aloud for the public?

start time: 362:43:30.000
end time: 371:15:10.000
confidence: 0.97
C: We have a list of seven items that were raised. It's not clear to me whether you want to adopt. The board wants to entertain a motion to adopt all of those or some of those. So a board member can make a motion to amend the motion to add one or more, or there can be more discussion to try to generate a consolidated list that has more consensus. But at the end of the day, there'll need to be a motion to amend Resolution 6894.

start time: 371:38:50.000
end time: 410:12:12.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Okay. So thank you for that direction. So what it looks like, team, is this is what I've heard so far come back across, that there's a desire to make sure that the in the criteria that there's a mention of some type, an experience with sped and CTE, as well as changing it from K12 to pre K to 12. There's also some desire in the room to say, to add something language that says that you have experience in a state with strong labor unions and to be specific with the advocacy to say effective advocacy and just simply adding that word. There's also a desire to somehow, if we have not already said it, Hank, somehow be able to identify someone that truly wants to be in Portland. I'm presuming because, you know, they said, how do we measure that? I'm presuming that that means that that individual is not concerned about umbrellas at all. Like they, they are not going to go to the store and buy an umbrella because they know that it rains here and therefore they are ready. So I don't know, but I'm just throwing it out there. And then there's also a desire to try to try not to be too specific and yet not too generalized in a way that it alienates People at the same time. And lastly, do we add something at the end of our criteria that says if you meet a portion of this 75% or whatever that language is that you have seen in other places, we still want you to apply as. Not to make anyone self select out. And so that is the addition with. In addition to everything else. So as a board, I'd like to know from us, would we like to make a motion to amend the current criteria to add these things or do we just presume that they've got it, they know it, and go with what's already listed? Somebody else has to say something. I can't say it.

end time: 431:56:40.000
confidence: 0.94
G: I mean, I think, you know, going with what they have came up with and kind of as I think about, I'm thinking more of like requirement versus, you know, when you look at applications, they need to require, but these are recommended, right? We would love for you to have. We need you to have this, but we'd love for you to have this as well. I think if we go with, I mean, outside of some of the little stuff, maybe like the Pre K through 12 stuff or effectiveness, I just. When we talk about effectiveness, I want to make sure we have some kind of metrics to measure that and how we would score that to see if they're. If they're effective. Outside of those, I think if we just kind of say, you know what, we have a great representation of the criteria that we have now and just know in. In the back of our head saying that, hey, we would like for them to have some experience in this. And that's kind of. We. We kind of keep that in the back of our head when we are doing interviews and stuff like that. Thanks.

D: Oh, I was just gonna say like what. What Hank said earlier that might help a lot in terms of like, you know, the board is unified. These are big pieces, right. Equity. If that's not your focus, you know, get out. Right. At the same time, I am very concerned about just increasing this list so much that people are going to self select out. So I think it's very important that we do have that priority. Like, you know, you know, this board, this district is about equitable practices. This district is about raising our student performances with a student. This district is about Uniter. Right. Unifier. Right. At the same time I think like what Director DePass said, I think we also need to be very clear from the very beginning being like the rest of this list is like shows our direction, direction and our priorities but not necessarily, you know, like if you don't meet all of them, please don't not apply. Right. You know where it's like if you understand this is our general priorities in our direction and you have something else to offer. Great. Right. Some kind of statement like that. Of course I'm not, you know it is 6:30 and it's past my bedtime so I'm trying to figure out how to word this more eloquently. But I think just having that like these are things that our board is set on and just having two or three things maybe longer than that, of course. But yeah, I do, I think I am on the side of caution in terms of I like the idea of like having these are nice to haves because again I worry that the longer the list is, the more we're going to get people self selected out. Especially really top candidates.

B: One of the reasons, well first of all Special ed is a big thing. This comes almost every board meeting. We hear about problems and also in the comments that people sent to add there were three or four places where they said you didn't even mention it, like you didn't even listen to us. So I think it's kind of important we put it in there for our public to see. We're listening. I think that's very important.

A: Excellent. Thank you. I'm going to let Michelle go before I go back because I have one qualifying statement that I believe that I can make that can wrap all of this, wrap all this up. But before I do that I want to make sure that I hear from Director DePass.

E: I just wanted to tell a short quip about these types of job descriptions that say something at the end that say something like must speak Dutch. So we don't want to get too specific. So I think it's similar to what Director Wong was saying. Yeah, we want to. These are preferred qualifications, not required.

A: Excellent. So I believe in this, in this date hang. And again I'm so grateful to have Ms. Liz here so that she can turn her mic on as soon as I start going a different direction. But I believe in this date I think what we're trying to get because team we're gonna have to make a motion because all of this falls up under board. Still falls up under board discussion. So we can either make an emotion to add all of these things or we can make a motion to add what we think is extremely imperative to be on the list. So it doesn't have to be all of it. Some of it can be preferred versus or what are you talking about? Preferred versus required. So some of it can be preferred, not necessarily required. So, so like are we saying that we. It is a requirement that you must have sped CTE and we change it from K12 to pre K12 or is it with Ms. Patty? Director Sullivan, would you be good with. We want one of those two, but not the other. And going down to the effective advocacy, is it required that we have the word effective versus just advocacy? So what we need to do is narrow this down quickly. I figure we got about another 120 seconds on this particular like and then we have to decide, okay, we're narrowing it down. This is what we're going to do. And then with that, once we have done that, what I'm going to need from somebody else on the floor, aside from myself, is I would like to make a motion that we do. And then someone else will say, I second that motion. And then we get to going with that team Go. It will go direct to the past, followed by Director Sullivan because those are the buttons. And then it'll be Director Wong followed by Director Bremitics. Go team.

E: You're good at this. I would say it would be important to add the include of the language that says special education and career technical education because that describes the things that we know that improve student outcomes. The sorry, I'm reading from your notes. Experience with strong labor unions, I think is also who we are as a district. And I think that's important to include as well. Those would be required attributes. I would just assume that we're going to have some of the advocates at the state level because of where we're at. But yeah, those two are very important to me. The special education, the career technical, and then the labor union experience.

D: Yeah. I just want to. I appreciate, Director Sullivan, you mentioning about the special education, because I think that's important that the public has spoken. We were listening. We are listening. It's important to include that. I guess I have a question, and maybe this is kind of. Hank, what you're going to speak to. My idea for emotion is that maybe it's. I mean, we hired Human Capital Enterprises to do this job. Maybe our motion is to ask them be like, hey, you heard the points that we're making, the list of bullet points that we have the concerns, and give them direction to implement these points as best that they know how. That would attract all the right candidates. Right. Because they're the ones that have the experience about, you know, how do you attract the best candidates. So maybe, you know, I'm asking, like, is there some kind of motion we can make or. And of course, if everyone else is okay with it, that we are giving direction for Human Capital Enterprises to take our points and do the best with it.

F: Thank you, Vice Chair Green. I think we are. I think we are landing somewhere. And I appreciate what Director Wong just said, which is exactly what I was. Was hoping to hear. I think we are well equipped to wordsmith the document. So if you collectively, as a board, are comfortable with that, then we will. We will take that. And what we need to hear, and I think. I think this is inherent in the motion that was made, is that you're good with what we come up with based on what we're hearing from you are the pieces that need to be added. So assuming that's correct, I just want to make sure that the board collect. I think there were seven. And Christy, I think you're taking notes on what those are. Is it. Is it the whole seven? And you can just say yes or it's or are there pieces of the seven that need to be conversed? But probably the most important piece is a gratitude that that we hear you giving us the directive to play with the word so that the board doesn't need to be spending time on that particular word.

So those are the four cte, Special ed, effective advocacy, labor unions. Is there something we're missing or did I get those wrong?

I'd also like to say for any questions or Comments about the superintendent search, please email superintendentsearchps.net Our next topic is going to be to discuss a salary range so that the candidates are aware of what to expect when applying. We've asked the staff to provide salary information for districts that are comparable in size and complexity both locally and in other parts of the country. The goal for this evening's discussion is to get a sense of where we all are comfortable providing direction for salary range in order to allow the potential candidates to know what they can expect. So with that, I would like to open up the floor for a little bit of board discussion on this matter. Don't everybody speak at once. Julia says excuse me Director. From Edward, since your light was already own, I'm going to allow you to go first.

start time: 659:34:10.000
end time: 667:16:20.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So I was going to ask a question. What would be most helpful to the search team for us to provide you with? I mean generally at this stage of the process, usually it's a range versus you know, it's going to be based on somebody's experience and where they're coming from and a whole host of other things. But what specifically are you looking for from us to give you guidance?

start time: 669:47:20.000
end time: 678:54:30.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Typically we receive direction on a salary range that is competitive in the market, including similar size systems which is a proxy for complexity. Of course, you know, there's certainly cost of living differences between San Francisco and Portland or Washington D.C. and Portland. But that's typically what we're looking for is direction relative to a salary range.

start time: 679:29:30.000
end time: 696:00:20.000
confidence: 0.96
F: And I might. Thank you, Steven. I might also add that we are not looking and we are not asking for the board to vot vote on on this. What we're asking you to do, board is to reflect with each other on the data that you see. And at the end of our time together, which should be around 7:30, what I would like to ask is each board member to reflect aloud where your comfort zone is. That gives us talking points. And really what we're after tonight is talking points as we work with candidates and at some point in the process they're going to be curious to know what the pay will be. So, so you're giving us talking points. You're stopping short of adopting a range. And the reason why we don't adopt a range at this moment in time is because you don't know who's going to end up as your, as your next superintendent and you don't want to be hamstrung by something you decide before you even know that. So that's what we're looking for. A rich conversation or I should say a robust conversation of the board. And then at the end we'll ask you each to reflect aloud for us.

start time: 696:13:30.000
end time: 724:41:40.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Yeah, I have a talking point. Sorry. I don't know. I guess I'll go before Director Scott. One of the things, you know, it's been a while since I looked at the salary range. I think I first looked at it when you first sent it. And it makes sense to have a starting point comparing other districts about the same size. But this is my big. But there's a difference between. I mean, you can't. Comparing districts of the same size is like comparing apples and oranges often. Because one of the unique things about Portland Public. Right. Like say for example in California where you have multiple cities, big cities and there's multiple big districts, you know, they kind of spread the media attention around a bit versus in Portland public being the biggest in the state. Portland Public is kind of the media, you know, central center. You know, we get the most scrutinized. We get the most responsibility in terms of like pushing for things in sale and we get the most, you know, just media scrutiny in general. Right. Everything. Everything looks that poorly in public. So that is an added responsibility. That's not necessarily apparent when you're comparing just, you know, districts of the same size. Right. Because you could have a lot of districts in the same size, but they may not be the biggest district in the state that's getting all the attention. So I think in terms of that, although I like the idea of being similar to other districts on the same size, I'm also okay. Open with incentivizing because they have this added responsibility of being here in our unique situation. Thank you.

I think what Hank was looking for in this was that we would have some discussion amongst ourselves about it and then we would come back and say this is what the range I was looking at. And then from there we'll go. That'll help give them direction. So I want to give everybody at least a minute or two to take a look at it, especially since the writing is so small.

confidence: 0.95
B: So I'm less kind of interested in the sort of Albuquerque, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, because we're in the market that we're in the market we're in, which is, I think generally how we should pay people, knowing that we may get somebody from somewhere else. But I also think some of these other markets have different cost of living, totally different situations, a lot more students. So I'm most interested in the largest districts near pps. And I agree with Eddie. I think there's additional complexity. Sorry, Director Wong. Additional complexity with Portland. I also believe we need to pay for experience. So for me that also you have a range. If you have somebody who hasn't been a superintendent before, you just get something different when you have a person who sat in the superintendent seat. So my thoughts on the range would be reflective of experience. And again, I think looking at Oregon and Washington is what we should do because that's the salary market we're in. I'm going to make one other comment. We weren't asked to talk about it, but having been through Contract negotiations with candidates before salary is like one point. And I'm just going to say at the outset that I think we should just have a pretty plain vanilla contract, not with a bunch of sort of goodies added in, because often you can have a reasonable salary and then the candidate asks for a whole host of things that are not the type of benefits we offer any of our other employees or not we traditionally haven't offered to PPS superintendents. And I also think we need to be mindful of the budget environment we're in.

B: Oh, yes, sorry. Looking down at my notes instead of my microphone. Yeah, so it looks like, you know, Beaverton's a little more, but was pretty comparable. But then again, that superintendent had had a lot of experience. Seattle is more, but that person had more experience too. I just think we should probably start about where we were and maybe have to go up above that. Certainly think we should pay for, we're going to have to pay for what.

H: Yeah, I'll try and digest this a little bit more as we go on. I, I, I don't know, I'm of really mixed minds on this and you know, we talked about that. I feel like we talked about this in a session a couple times ago. But, you know, part of me wants to say, look, we've got to be competitive, right? And you know, when we think about, you know, superintendent searches, you know, we want, we got the best person, we want experience first. We got to be competitive. I also think this is one of those really rare markets, right, where, you know, there just aren't that many districts, there aren't that many districts of this size. There are many districts recruiting and I get a little bit troubled sometimes by the like, oh, everyone else is paying, you know, 350, 400, you know, we have to pay that. But, but the reality is if we pay that, then the next person, well, they got to pay 400 or more. And I think, you know, I've been getting some emails, I assume my colleagues have as well, that are pointing to some national data and, you know, saying, look, for a district our size, you know, superintendents get paid between, you know, 250 and 300, 325, which, you know, looking at, at other local districts that the data you've pulled you know, near us, that, that, that range feels, feels maybe about right, I guess. I just, you know, I, it's. It's a little bit like professional athletes, right, that, that it's a very limited pool we're pulling from. But, but as a result, those salaries get inflated. I, I'm not convinced that paying more gets you a better superintendent. And I think that's where I, I struggle. And I, I certainly think that paying less, you know, there are some superintendents who will opt out. Like, that's, that's just a reality, right? If you're making 350, $400,000, you're, you know, you're going to opt out if, if we're offering 250, 275. But I, I have yet to see data that shows that those superintendents, you know, are more effective in terms of raising student achievement. And I think for me, that's what it comes down to is, you know, how do we know we're going to get somebody who's going to raise student achievement in Portland? You know, and I'm not sure an experienced superintendent is going to raise student achievement more than an ambitious new superintendent with brand new ideas.

H: Who's going to sort of push the envelope on some things. You know, I also, there's a political dynamic to this which, you know, in public session, we should just acknowledge, right? Which is that, you know, a huge salary for the Portland superintendent puts them at a, at a. You know, it immediately puts a target on their back. And, and I think we should just acknowledge that, you know, Guadalupe, who was not getting paid anything, you know, out of the norm, right. For a district our size, but was continually faced with, with this political dynamic. I mean, people coming in and commenting publicly about his pay. And I think that we need to think about that dynamic in terms of bringing someone in. And I think about the fact, I don't think the city of Portland has set pay for the city manager, the new city manager that's gonna come in. But I have a hard time believing that pay is gonna be in the 350 to $400,000 range. And running a city the size of Portland, I guess someone could make an argument. I think it's going to be a lot harder, right. Than running a district the size of Portland public schools. And so I could imagine dynamic there as well, right. If we were to hire a superintendent at 350, because that's the going rate, and then all of a sudden the city of Portland brings in a city manager at 250 or 300 people are going to say, well, wait a minute, what's the difference here? And what makes education special that requires such a premium? And so this has been, when I think about this, it's really been my struggle over the last couple months. Is that sort of question of do we just go along with what every other district is doing, or do we say, as a district, you know what, we're going to pay a really good salary. Living here is expensive, no doubt, but we're not going to pay an exorbitant salary. And we're going to be looking for a candidate who's willing to fit that mold. And really what we're looking for, what's more important is a candidate who's going to raise student education achievement. And if someone can show me that paying an extra hundred, I'm actually, I'm stealing a line from Herman and Gary during our contract negotiations three years ago. So I just want to acknowledge that if you can show me and guarantee you're going to raise student achievement, I will pay you a million dollars to come in and do it. But absent that, I get a little bit nervous about. About some of these high salary.

E: Nobody said you can't say Andrew wasn't director Scott wasn't leading, listening. And I appreciate you bringing that forward because I've been having similar struggles trying to look at comparing these very high salaries, particularly because of the moment that we're in, making cuts all around the district, 30 million in cuts this year, and also wondering how it looks to the public when we're making these cuts. At the same time, we're hiring an executive that will make a very healthy salary. I'm also concerned about organizations that have the top earner. The ratio between the difference between a top earner and the lowest earners make tells you about an organization. What it tells you is how workers are treated and the concern for the worker. You don't want a very large gap. And so I would be in favor of offering a lower end of the scale. And I also submitted comments to this effect. And that was that if someone really wants to be in Portland and they're really committed to the work in Portland, they may be willing to accept. In other words, they're not here just for the salary. They're here for other reasons. They're here because they have a demonstrated track record of raising student achievement, particularly for the groups that we don't serve as well. And they're here to do the work, whether it's you know, hopefully long term, but they're not. Their primary motivation isn't salary.

We're talking about $70 million in cuts potentially if the state doesn't come through. And chances are. Are pretty slim. Sorry. Yeah, okay. It's not a definite thing. It could go either way. But I guess my point is that, you know, there's. In the teaching world, there's this thing we say like, oh, yeah, you're a good teacher for a first year teacher. Right. Because I mean, like. Right. But that's like the thing, you know, because when I was working as a universe.

A: Excellent. Thank you. I'll just state where I was, where I've been sitting at since I've solved this. Hank. Mines were just numbers. I'm between where I sit, I'm thinking somewhere between 275 and 300 with. I do want to maintain our. The language from the previous one that had the additional 75k that was based on the specific metric points. So it was 25,000 per metric point that if they can achieve what that was, then they would get the additional 25,000 per. And so with that, if you do everything that you're supposed to do or that you said you were going to do, you would actually make 375,000. And so again, it would be our current language is what I would be wanting to make maintain and that we keep that in there and we tie the bonus to the specific metrics that we already have that are tied to our existing board goals. So that would be my thought on it. Director Hollins?

G: Yes, I was thinking about this a couple ways. You know, I was thinking of i1 at first I just did by math. So what I did is I added up all the base salaries and you know, to basically divided them up by, you know, all the students, you know, came up with a point 2.88 and that time that by two, just totally by the math based on all the information we got and it came up to around $253,440. That's just the math piece. That's just how I calculated it. But I do, I do want to make sure that, you know, I'm with Andrew and I went a little bit step further, right. I looked at some of the highest paid, I'm sorry if you heard that car noise. I looked at the performance of some of these higher paid superintendents. So I actually went on the website, look at their scores to see if and I think it kind of talked to what Andrew was speaking of. Do a higher paid salary gets us results. And so when I did the research and tried to look at their scores, you know, for you know, the highest, some of the highest paid ones, I really didn't see that correlation either. And so I am like with Andrew, I don't know if that correlation is relevant to the performance that we would get. You know, so like if I were to see, you know, for instance, you know, when I look at Albuquerque, right, Because that's on here and I'm looking at, okay, this is a nice salary with the test scores. When I look at Detroit, what are the test scores, right? What, how are they performing even with this higher, higher prices? I didn't see any thing that said, you know what, you pay them more, you'll get better results. So I, I think I'm more on the spectrum of give them a good salary while they're here and let's get, let's tie it to performance, right? Because that's what we're paying for, right? We're paying for, to the job of make sure our kids are getting educated and are performing well. Right. And so that's kind of where I'm, so I'm kind of. And I'm, I'm a little bit lower. I'm at the 253. But, you know, up to. I would say up to 278, 290. Just because I would want, regardless that they have experience. I mean, or not, they don't build a higher spectrum on experience. But I want to see results. Right? Our test scores is horrible.

G: Our performance is horrible. You know, when you got 17% of black kids not meeting proficiency, that's a problem. You know, So I want to make sure we get someone in here who can solve that problem and not just run the district. We have plenty of superintendents that run the digital over the last 20 years, and we haven't seen. Well, we just start seeing. Be fair. We just start seeing some improvement in our math. In our math data. So I would want to make sure that whoever we get in performs and make sure our stuff. And if they can do that again, they can get a million dollars a year. I would be the first one. And I'm going to take from Herman. I'll be jumping on the diets and pay them a million dollars a year if they can move the needle. But the goal for me, and the only reason why I'm here is because we want to make sure we move the needle for our kids.

A: Thank you so much, Director Hollin. So at this time, what I'm gonna do. I saw you. At this time, what I'm gonna ask us to do as we begin to, like, make some final comments is make sure that in our final comments, we state our range. Like you, everybody has said range. So I need us in our final comments as we. As we wrap it up that we actually state what we believe our range is so that they can capture that information. And then from that, they can come up with the consensus of at least what they've heard from us. Regardless of whether or not they feel like we're doing the right thing, they'll at least have an idea as to exactly what it is each of us are thinking, and they'll be able to build from that. So with that, I'm ask director Sullivan to share her comments and range.

B: But tying performance to salary, at least for teachers, doesn't work. Doesn't make any difference. I think tying the superintendent's test scores to a higher salary is not going to work. And in fact, I've seen it said in some emails, oh, he's just going to make a profit on the back of our kids before me. There's that kind of feeling. So I don't think that's a good idea at all. I would much prefer just having a salary and hiring somebody who hopes going to do a good job, have to do a good job and hopefully the test scores go up. But tying that to performance, I don't think it works. I don't think it's good. But that's it. Now I'm supposed to give a range. Okay, I will give a range and I'm higher than you. I'm going to say, and this is total after all the stuff, retirements and everything, I'll say 300,000 to 350,000. I wasn't talking into the microphone. Did you hear it?

end time: 1135:13:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So the range is going to be really important and we shouldn't pay anything more than we have to. But I think it's unrealistic to think that we're going to get somebody who has the attributes that we're looking for. We just approved the criteria for less than 275 because they're probably already working in a medium sized district. I would go from 275 to 360 and again like no perks from my perspective. But I do think we need to be pay competitive because there's no reason for somebody to. Most people don't shift jobs and take less money for a whole host of reasons. And I think we also need to look at we're going to be a challenging place to lead for a whole host of reasons. From a budgetary standpoint, we have lots of work to do in terms of improving student achievement. Expectations are going to be high. I firmly believe that you need to pay that. And what I'm afraid of is if we have twos too low of a range that self selecting out. If people will make decisions to not even apply for a job that maybe they'd be taking a pay cut. I absolutely think we want somebody to come to Portland and be passionate about being here. We also have to be realistic. I mean we all have jobs and professionally we get paid. None of us, none of us go to our paid jobs because we love it solely so you can be passionate about your job and also have your performance rewarded. And I think that we have to be realistic about the type of candidates we get if our range is too low. Because I mean we're looking at some ranges that, you know, districts with 20,000 fewer students and a lot less complexity, they're paying their superintendents more than some of the ranges we're talking about. And so I think we should have a full discussion and understand kind of what the range. When we're all done, I'd love to hear from the team about what they're hearing. I know when we, we went out and looked for an interim superintendent, it wasn't the easiest sell. And even with a very healthy salary, I think everybody's also going to look at what we were paying, what the base pay the superintendent who was just here and he was at 341. So if you have somebody come in with more experience than the person that we had before, but we're going to pay them substantially less for the same board that was just paying a Superintendent 341.

E: Okay. Yes. I wanted to thank the team for putting these numbers together. Comparing different districts by size, it's good as a, helpful as a, helpful as a starting point. But all of these districts have student demographics that are different and unique to their local communities. And so it's hard. It's not an apples to apples comparison. I also agree with Director Sullivan in that offering someone a million dollars if they could get the entire board has to approve that. And that's way over the salary that we would even literally be able to offer. So I don't, I agree with Director Sullivan that we don't want to type performance pay to performance. And then we're looking for ranges. And I would start on the lower end. Again, back to the point that I shared with you all earlier, I would probably start around 275,000 and go to 350,000 again. You know, we have a budget crisis right now and we want someone that wants to be here and might be willing to be here for a small pay cut. And that pay cut is relative because the cost of living varies from community to community that median incomes rise and fall. So yeah, I would say 275 to 350. And understanding that these are great numbers to start with, but there's a lot of, there's a lot of context that's missing.

D: Yeah, in terms of range, I don't know. I think I'm going to buck the trend here and just say I think we need to see the candidate first. It's very difficult to determine a range. Like for example, if it's a first year superintendent, there's a lot of ambition and stuff, but it's unproven. I would lean towards the lower end of the range. But you know, if it's a Sophia Smith of superintendents, you Know, I'd be willing to try to get that person here. Right.

I think we could have a longer conversation about that. I don't think it worked in the superintendent's contract, and I think it caused. I mean, caused a lot of strife within the community about what the true incentives were. So. And I agree with Director Brim Edwards. I. I think we should pay a salary without a lot of the extras. I'm always a little surprised when, you know, cars and housing allowances and deferred comps and all those other things. I think just, just. It often feels like it's an attempt to obfuscate what the. What the actual compensation is. I think we should just be really clear if we want to pay a superintendent $400,000, we should. We should be willing to say that because I think our community's, you know, going to see. Going to see through that. And, you know, I guess I get back to what I think Hank said at the very beginning. I mean, I. I can give a range if you want me to. I think it's. I think if I heard you say that you. Did I hear you say you weren't going to publish a range because we want to leave it open. What did I. What was that at the very beginning?

start time: 1204:50:52.000
end time: 1239:09:18.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Yeah. Yeah, I guess from that. So I would probably, you know, I'd probably be in the sort of 225 to 350 range. Again, it's going to depend a lot on. I mean, I think, yeah, if we can get. We can get a really experienced superintendent, that's good, but I'm not sure I went back to look because I wanted to make sure that our criteria don't require that. And that was something I was looking for in that the criteria we just adopted. Again, experience is great, but it's not everything for me. So, in fact, I'm not even always with some candidates, it's an advantage. With some, some candidates is a disadvantage. So I'll just, I mean, I'll put that out there right now that, that I think sometimes getting a second in command who wants to move up can actually be better than finding someone who's been doing this for 10 or 15 years. But again, that's very, very candidate dependent and that comes across in an interview process. I would like to ask a question, I think, for our general counsel. I would, I would love an analysis of organs, equal pay law, and whether and how it might apply to a superintendent. I'm not a lawyer, so, you know, my advice, my, my opinion on this is completely a layperson's opinion. I, but my, but I'm pretty, I'm pretty familiar with equal pay law because, you know, I hire a lot of people and it's something that has really changed the landscape in Oregon. And I guess the question I, the very specific legal question I have is, will we run into any issues under Oregon's equal pay law if we pay the new superintendent less than what we were paying our prior superintendent? I hope the answer to that question is no, because it's, it's a single incumbent position and the comparison under the law is to other people in that position. And so there is no other Portland Public school superintendent. And so I don't think that law would apply. I just want to make sure because it is a new law that says in place that was not in place the last time we hired a superintendent. So I'd appreciate an analysis on that.

E: Yeah, I just, I'm going to share some kind of thoughts around just the conversation you had. So first of all, I think you're thinking about two different things. One is pay. But the other is in your conversation you want the best superintendent you can have for Oregon. And in this moment in time, I mean for PPS this moment in time, I would hate to have you do anything that would limit that candidate pool. And you're right. Pay doesn't always get you the candidate you want. But the inverse is true. Also, the candidate you really want may not come here and likely wouldn't come to this to lower a salary unless they're coming from a place that is far more expensive to live than Portland. So superintendents who are really good and really passionate and want to invest in your city and love this city and love your district aren't really coming for the money, but the money does also a competitive salary gets them there. And the other thing you risk is even regardless of the analysis around the Equal Pay act does the is the next person female? Is the next person a female of color? And so you're you could be setting yourself up for a different perception but but two separate things. Salary is one and it's really important that you're competitive to get them here. But the candidate you get here and how you interview and choose it isn't going to be about the salary getting in there. You're right about that because you're going to choose the best person. So stay focused on what it is you want in a candidate and give yourself enough range of salary to get that person when you choose them.

D: And I would add to my colleagues comments anytime we entertain conversations with boards about superintendent contracts and or for that matter any employee compensation package, I invite boards to think about three outcomes retrievals. The first is to attract and retain. That's a goal that you desire to achieve. The second goal is to offer compensation that allows you to achieve that first outcome and that needs to be fair and competitive given the market context. And as I said, size and complexity or size of a district is prosperity proxy or complexity and geography is a proxy for cost of living. So those factors have to be contemplated when you entertain final negotiations with your selected candidate. And then the third outcome is to do that in a fiscally responsible manner and in light of some of the budget challenges that you face and districts frankly all across the country face in light of declining enrollment Esser funding Cliff that's something that needs to be considered as a factor and certainly that has resonated in several of your comments tonight. It's important to know that you're going.

D: Terms of the contract once you identify you're a sole finalist and that becomes part of the salary setting compensation package that you reach agreement on. But I will echo the comment that my colleague Christy Perry shared. If the range is too low, you risk attracting a pool of applicants that fit your next superintendent criteria. And you know, there are superintendents in Oregon and systems significantly smaller, with significantly less complexity, significantly less media and political data dynamics at play who are making 250,000 plus. Those are the facts. So know that that's something that needs to be contemplated within the context of the bigger picture of achieving those three outcomes. Hank, I'll turn it back to you.

H: I just want to jump in really quickly. One of the reasons they're making that is because of what we paid our last superintendent. And I guess that's the point I was trying to make earlier, and I'm not sure I articulated it very well. The market here is being set by us as well as being followed by us. And so I hear you, Steve, they are. But it's a little bit of this circle of like, I don't know why some of these, some of these superintendents with 19,000, 17,000, 22,000 people are getting.

G: Paid what they are.

start time: 1344:15:04.000
end time: 1350:19:10.000
confidence: 0.99
H: But I'm guessing it's because they said, look at what the Portland Public School superintendent is getting paid. And so I just think we need to be very conscientious of that fact, that sort of saying, oh, that's what they're getting paid. We have to match that. Well, they're getting paid that because of where we were. And if we were to hire a superintendent at 275, I guarantee those superintendents would not be able to negotiate significant raises for their contract extensions.

F: Yeah, so I, I would say. So let me first just, if I may, just a quick response to Director Scott. We have a hard time attracting superintendents to Oregon. The pay of Oregon superintendents is lower than other states. We have the hardest time attracting folks from Washington state. They laugh when they see our salaries. So I would not say that the reason why the superintendent's salary for Portland starts with the number three is because we got it there because we wanted it to be high for the rest of the state. I would say that in the marketplace to attract folks of talent, you will, you will lose strong talent if you are not competitive on a regional basis. And as it was said earlier, we all know Portland, there isn't a lot of other districts in Oregon that have the complexity of Portland, some might say none. So just be mindful of that. Our goal here, and I think. I think our collective board plus consultants, is to bring you the best candidates possible who can do a really complicated piece of work and do it exceedingly well.

H: So, Hank, I'm not, I'm not seeing that in the data we have, though, what you just said. I'm not seeing in the data either the data that was provided to us or some of the other data. I mean, I've been getting some emails quoting some national data showing that for our district, our size, it's kind of the 250 to 350 range. So I'm just, I'm curious because I know you guys didn't do the national salary comparisons, right, because that was something you said you didn't have. Have access to. So I'm just.

end time: 1393:00:26.000

F: When you say that I don't know how many districts the size of Portland are paying 250 around the country, and I would say precious few and probably not from states that are the states you're most excited to attract candidates from. Ultimately, this is a board decision, not a consultant decision. Our collective, and I do think I speak for everybody in the room, is to attract great talent to this search. Portland deserves it. And Portland is a special, special place. So just consider that as you, as you move forward in the process, everything from the decisions you make about design to salary toward how you're having conversations in public space. Candidates are watching every meeting right now. And our goal is to entice them to this incredible opportunity in this incredible city and be mindful of that. That's what I would leave with.

H: I hear that, and I don't mean to belabor the point, but I just, I think this is one of those moments where it is, of course, easier for you to attract candidates if we have a higher range. I'm looking at a Chicago superintendent making under 400,000 a year. 396. That district is 323,000 students. And that was about $20,000 more than what the Portland Public Schools superintendent, the prior one, was making with 30. 36. Sorry, with. With 44,000 students. Boston superintendent is making considerably less at 328. So I just want to make sure we're being factual when we say what the range is, because again, I've been through some of these search processes for other, like, nonprofits, large organizations, and we are the ones setting the market. And I guess I'm just. Why wouldn't a superintendent from Chicago say, oh, gosh I can go to Portland. Yeah, that's a little bit of a pay cut, but man, that job's way easier. Chicago is not an easy school district to be superintendent of.

F: We can't attract. I don't want to argue. I'm just giving you my best thinking and you'll have to do with it as you will. But Chicago is a city with many, many districts that surround Chicago Public Schools. Many of them are small districts. Many of those superintendents of small districts of city 6, 10, 12,000 are making in excess of 300 and maybe in excess of 350. I'll leave you with. It's our best thinking. It's your, it's your wallet, it's your purse and you've got to make a decision about how to spend it. Our best thinking is that we would want you to be competitive to attract the best talent. But I don't want to argue. I'm just telling you our best thinking is that.

A: Excellent. Thank you. Thank you so very much. So while the reason that I was asking everyone to as you were giving your closing arguments to make sure that you stated your range is so that I can write it all down and come up with from a group perspective, what I'm hearing is the lowest number on the table thus far is 225and the highest number on the table thus far going all the way around, is 360. So with that, I would say, I mean, just not my own thoughts, but just what I've heard on the table that equates to a range minus one person because not everybody chipped in. But based on what we have here, a consensus is a range anywhere from 225 to 360. And that encapsulates what everyone was thinking. Thinking there is some discussion on the table around whether or not performance metrics would be or should be included. That would be a contract thing that each individual board member would have to, that you will have to figure out whether or not we can vote on a contract, contract or agreement that does or does not have it. That's going to be for each one of us to decide on our, on our own again. So with that, I think if I'm not mistaken, and I'm keeping us within the 730 mark. Hank, you've got a range 225 to 360.

Our next meeting of the Board of education will be April 24, 2020 24. And this meeting is adjourned. Thank.
