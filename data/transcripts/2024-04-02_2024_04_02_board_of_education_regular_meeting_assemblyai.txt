A: Different walk. And our athletes, they're showing the time, showing up, the time on class. They're all on track to graduate. They all have increased GPAs. We set a bar for our GPAs to be a 3.0, because, unfortunately, we don't think 2.5 get our kids anywhere. And so one. One thing that really stuck to me was just the feedback from our counselors, but just also from our. From our administrators and our teachers. I got several messages this year about how these guys were showing up in the classroom and doing things that they never exemplified up until this year. You know, these things were challenges for them. You know, we know the phones are a big things. The phones wasn't a big thing for us, right? That wasn't the issue for us, right? So what I just want to say to everybody, man, if. If there's a will, there's a way, right? But we got to demonstrate ourself a lot better how we show up and what we give our kids access to. And so I'm actually absolutely excited about the opportunities that we were granted this year because of the way these young men behave. You know, I mean, like, letting them. Letting a young lady in the door is important to us. Letting a senior citizen come in that door and hope that door is important to us. The way we talk to and communicate.

A: That's why our kids are thinking that they're nothing at this point. Some of them don't want to be here. And we go through a lot of different mental health battles because these kids don't have a consistent figure in their life. And that's what I wanted to be. I said, whether I'll be a father figure, a brother figure, whatever figure I need to do, man, I'm here to do God's work and get these kids across the finish line. And so we're honored for PPS to let us be here today and be present. I can't thank these boys enough. Even on a public speaking thing, we know these. These boys, they just want to talk through their phones, right? These guys got up and spoke in front of several people, right? And every time I challenged them to be better, they stepped up for me. And I'm. I'm forever grateful. I'm committed to the true North. True north is near and dear to our heart. It's a. It's an area that changed my life when I was trying to figure out who my why and my purpose was in life when I moved back here from Texas.

A: And try to find my feet. And some of these same kids told me, coach Law, this is a purpose for you. Your purpose is us. And we appreciate you, appreciate you never giving up on us. We appreciate you being by our side. And the biggest thing that stuck to me, man, is when we lost that championship. Just how they came and embraced me with love and told me, man, you changed my life. And that's what we want to do, man. We want to change warnings, basketball and sports as a change, to change these kids life and make them think they can do whatever they put their minds to. And that's bigger than any championship can ever speak for. So and as you're going through this stuff, the last thing I say, it takes away from a lot of your family, right? And you just, it's the never ending story, right? But when you take a chance to just breathe and reevaluate and look or reflect over the whole season, I was just like, man, I'll do this a whole nother year again and over and over, over again because you know what I mean? You know, I have the differences with the ladies about I let them coming in at home, right? I have the sleepless nights, right, and getting back up and going to do the 9 to 5. And I just couldn't do that without the energy and the input and the effort and the willingness of this group. Man, this group has truly changed the trajectory of the north to where students feel like they're part of something greater. Like Katie had attested to. We've been in middle schools this year. These guys have been big brothers to the younger ladies and ladies and gentlemen in our community. And so when they see these guys, it's like, man, I'm going in the stores, man, I can't go anywhere in St. John's Portland without people just honored and privileged to tell me about how great these young men is and what they mean to the north. And, and they don't ever want us to leave anywhere. And I told them, man, we're here for life. And so thank you guys. We appreciate you guys. Now let's give a standing ovation for this amazing group of young men.

Came over from Scapoose and just growing tremendously. Tremendous. Gonna be a key piece. Remember I told you this today. A key piece to the reason why we get back next year. Matt Beatty, next. This is my guy, man. He's been. He's been a part of the north, man, ever since I've been a part of it has been really true. Has been going through the grind since day one. Continues to show up, continues to put in the work, continues to do what's asked of him. And I just really appreciate this young man and really sacrifice for the team. We thought he might have had a broken rib off a charge he took, but man, he was a true warrior, man. And this is who he is, man. He sacrificed tremendously for this team, for the greater good. And I'm forever grateful. Griffin.

Me and this guy, man, he's been around with us since day one. Been had the privilege to coach this kid since. Since fourth grade, I believe. And he's been. He's the true exemplify of man. If I wanted to look for a friend that's really my friend, I will look to this guy, man. Malachi Burns. This next guy I like to call a late boomer, but he's a true Hooper. We call him the 1v1 specialist and that's my guy, John Fernandez, man. This is a guy that I've been knowing before him coming over to Roosevelt this year. I've been knowing this kid for some time. I used to work in Akwadi Green for about five, six years and got to spend some time with him on the middle school grind and just got to see how much he grew and matured. Used to always talk to him about how the way to control his emotions and it would make him a better player. He did just that for us this year. My guy, DJ D Reed, man, My next guy, man, is the most underrated but persevere that I've ever seen in my life. Like everything that's been thrown at this guy, he continues to fight, he continues to strive for more, he continues to get in the gym and just say, man, I don't care what the narrative is on me. I'm writing my own story in my book, right? And I'm gonna continue to do that regardless of whatever other people think, right? I'm gonna keep persevering and pushing on. That's my guy, C Dub, Mr. Chance White. This next person, man, we, we, we experienced a lot in the past year, man, and overcame a lot. And it's truly what I'm seeing you guys like sometimes man, winning games in the fashion that these guys did and playing basketball doesn't really speak to the chest testimony of this team. And this gentleman was really facing some adversity and some challenges and we had some rough patches just being, being honest. And so to see him still sitting up here and getting the opportunity to go play college basketball in a full ride scholarship when he just didn't really know where he was headed at a point in time because like I said, basketball could throw you a lot of curveballs too. So for all those guys that think they too small to do anything, this is a guy that can tell you, man, height don't matter. It's the heart, it's the personality, it's the characteristics, the way you treat people right, it's the experience when you encounter people, man. And this dude is a near dude, special dude to my heart and I'm just happy that we got him across the finish line and he's on the greatest things because he's a well rounded young man and we all face some things, right? And even when we face our dark moments, we, we got to help people see the light. And so we call this guy the engine of the team, Utrila Morris. And lastly, Mr. State Player of the year offensive player of the year, first team offense. We were so happy when he told us he was coming back for Arizona. We, we had to Celebrate. And he's just been a true pillar in our community as well, too, and have an opportunity to coach a lot of these kids. You guys, the special thing about this team is, right, a lot of people have to go recruit to make this happen. These people that's been a part of True north since day one and been in our community since day one, they've been playing for our feeder teams. They've been representing Roosevelt community for years. So this ain't just something that we try to put together for the North. This is the north that you're looking that. And, and, and this guy truly told me, I said, you know, he had coaches from all over trying to recruit him to come play basketball, right? And I asked him, I said, do you want to. Do you want to go be a part of somebody else history or do you want to make history? And, and, and, and they. They response is like, man, we want to make this different. We want to change the narratives of the north and how people receive us, right? We want to change history in general. And that's just what happened. And we couldn't have did it without this man. He's like the leader of this team. He's the glue guy. He's the one that's going to reach out and make sure guys is feeling good and they are right, and reach out to his bros and just really grown as a leader. Used to be a quiet guy. Some guys used to think he was cop, but that is not the case. This dude has a true heart and he really cares about the north community and what our kids, our next generation have to come. And he wanted to leave a legacy. We wanted to leave a Lexington, and we're doing just that. But Terrence Heel and some of my coaches are just busy because we're super proactive, right? So we're catching up with the workload. So unfortunately, we want to shout out to all our coaches that are not here, but the coach that is here, man, has just been not only just a great coach and a great asset to this team, but has been a really good friend for me. And the type of friend that's gonna tell you when you're wrong, right? Not just trying to glorify you with being right or just being a part of something right. And it takes having people like that on your side to continue to make you be better and keep things in perspective and making sure that our kids and our community is getting the best experience. And so I've worked with a lot of people on this race, and sometimes I'm Just used to doing it all. I know some of us be in that situation. Like, I'm willing to, to wear every hat because that's how passionate I am about these kids. But this guy came right in and said, hey, man, slow down. You got a staff. How do you need to utilize me? How can I be doing this? I'm here for you, my bro. Are you okay? And oftentimes in this work world when you're just a doer, people don't understand how this stuff impacts you on a day to day basis too. So it's good to have some real ones in your life that's gonna say, man, I'm here to support you too and let you know that I care about you and how you feeling. And I want to be a part of this greatness, right? I want to be an asset. I just don't want to be here in the shadow. So couldn't have did it without this guy, man. My guy, Vernon. Odin. Once again, True north is a real thing. We ain't going nowhere. We're here to stay and get these guys some love because they definitely deserve it. One more thing, fellas. Last but not last but not least, we want to shout out. I want to shout out our principal, kd, our athletic director, Willie Williams. Man, when I tell you, man, that.

C: And that happened because they. I want to make sure you understand this. They chose pbs, they chose Vincent, they chose Roosevelt. I want to say that again because he used Terrence as an example. Terrence, every private school, every public school tried to get him to go there. He went to his neighborhood school, right? That's what we want to have happen. And they Talked about the 6 through 12 model. Eric and Jamar both exemplify what we want to have happen in our youth program as it goes on the high school Second thing I want to say is, how about those two coaches? They are remarkable, and they're examples of. They're just two of many coaches that we have in our league that put our kids first, whether that's spending less time with their families or bringing families with them into the gyms, whether that's for going on vacations, getting up at 6am, doing summer long when they're not getting paid for the coach commitment to change the lives of kids. And then the last thing I'd like to just say is to you as a school board, we're just so thankful for the support that you've given athletics. And I'm sure you can continue to support. Continue to support athletics in a major way so we can continue to provide these type of opportunities for our kids, and then you can celebrate their excellence.

And before that, we had no middle school programs. A lot of people moving, student athletes moving out of their neighborhood schools. And Marshall really has built a program that gave. Built a super strong foundation and I think gave kids opportunities that, as we heard tonight, they extend way beyond the court. So I just want to thank Marshall.

G: Well, first of all, I want to thank all the students who attended our annual district student summit on March 7th. Just for context, for people who don't know. So as student representative I do the district student council which is a group of representatives from all the PPS high schools. And one of our most important things that we do is we plan an annual student summit which is a day long event where we invite PPS high schoolers to come and attend learning sessions which are student led. And we talk about different aspects of the district, you know, like maybe how PBS works or what Title IX looks like in pps. And then this year, which is a new thing, we had a resource fair where we invited community organizations to table during lunch and students were able to sign up for volunteer opportunities. And then after lunch we also had a panel. So thank you to the board members who sat on that panel and answered questions and thank you to the staff as well. And then also thank you to the board members who just attended, not to be on the panel but just to see what was going going on. Students really enjoyed that and they appreciate, you know, just like sitting in the sessions meant a lot to have that support. And I think this is a really, really great opportunity because something that we've seen in PPS is that students are pretty isolated to their schools. We have school based identities, I would say, but I do think we have struggled with a shared district identity and we've heard this from numerous students that the student Summit for provides an opportunity for you to get to meet students from other schools. If you want to talk about district issues in that setting, that's great and that definitely happens. But also just to meet them and to know what goes on there. I thought this was really beautiful. A DSE member described the student Summit as a moment of togetherness. And I really think that is what it is. So I'm glad there has been consistent support for that and I really hope we can continue it. But I also want to say I think this is something. Well also DSC members brought this up as well that we should make more consistent because part of being student centered is that having student led spaces and this commitment to student voice can't be a one off event. We need to continue that throughout the year. So this is an amazing opportunity and we really appreciate it and we know that it's going to be a part of continuing that. We have DSC hoping to expand that role. And thank you to all the support from the board. Additionally, one thing I did want to acknowledge because I think it's important, it's showing it matters to students. On March 15th there was a student walkout in support of Palestine. I think it says a lot when Students are walking out and we're getting to that point. And I think students really just want there to be more of an open dialogue because I have heard from students and there are varied perspectives on this, but concerns are arising around censorship and an increase in hate speech. So I think I just really wanted to make space for that because that was a student led initiative and students really deeply care about that. And that has been a continued commitment. It's not a one off. There is active, ongoing support, their Instagram account. So I do think like making the district aware of that.

F: I also attended and it was amazing. I wasn't able to go for the whole time, but I learned something there. And that was this concept of an open door policy. Where you say, I have an open door policy. You can come at any time. But the balance of power sometimes puts the burden on the person with less power to come and approach somebody with open door. So reframed it as an empty office policy. In other words, if you're a leader, you should kind of be out in the community. But I also wanted to. I just came in when I heard your comment about an entire school community. And I think it's really, I really. You said this before and we are just kind of one big community. We're a conglomeration of lots of little communities. But it's. We're one school community. And I hope, I hope to just always keep that front and center. Thank you.

E: Okay, I suppose I will start. Hello, I'm Klipso, or Cal for short. Cupper. I'm one of Frankie's peers at Franklin High School and I'm one of the co founders of a large inter school community of Portland Public Schools Students for Justice in Palestine. And thank you. And that is what I will be here to talk about tonight. Hello, PPS board members. I come here today on behalf of students and the community to demand that you take substantive action to address the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people that has claimed the lives of at least 33,000 people. We have sat and waited for you to act of your own volition, and we have gotten naught but the crushing weight of your silence. You claim that. That your goal is that a graduate of Portland Public Schools will be a compassionate, critical thinker, able to collaborate and solve problems and be prepared to lead. To lead a more socially just world. And yet you refuse to take even the smallest steps to see this actualized. Our demand thusly, as students for justice in Palestine are direct and threefold. First, we call on you to act as your position implies and educate on the history of Palestine, settler colonialism and Zionism, so that we might learn from these actions. Next, we demand you do what you have done previously and repeatedly and issue a statement condemning this ongoing genocide. Again, you have been ongoingly and crushingly.

E: And third, we demand that you put your mouth where your money. Or we. We demand that you put your money where your mouth should be and divest Portland Public Schools from all companies participating in and profiting off of the ongoing genocide. Specifically, we ask that you end your contract with SHI International and any and all companies marked by the BDS or Boycott, Divest Sanction Movement. Now, these should not be that difficult of demands. You have released statements previously. You teach if you want to work with money. Ending contracts frees up money. But I suppose you would rather spend more money to put military training in our schools. Well, you. But if I need to elaborate on why I think this is important, there's one TED Talk that I've seen repeatedly in school and I think it's very appropriate here. It's a really good TED dog, which is probably why I've seen it so many times, but it's by Chimuandra Ngozi Adichie. It's called the Danger of a Single Story. This carries a very important message. It talks about how if you only get one story, you see books as only about British kids drinking ginger beer, how how you view Africa as only people living in huts and how you can view an ongoing genocide wrongly and as though it were a war or against terrorists when 33,000 people, almost all of them even by Israel's Inflated numbers, only 9,000 of them were Hamas. That is an unacceptable amount of civilian casualties and you have done nothing. You have not spoken out. We demand action on that and my time seems to be nearly up, so please change this.

B: My name is Diego Romero. I am a student representative on the Climate Crisis Response Committee and I'm here to present a letter on behalf of the Climate Crisis Response Committee. Dear Interim Superintendent and members of Portland Public School Board, as members of the Climate Crisis Response Committee, we submit this letter requesting that you consider funding additional project management staff to support the implementation of the Climate Crisis justice and Sustainable Practices Policy. We understand that the district is weighing many factors for this next year's budget and is being required to make hard decisions on staffing. We see the work of the CCRP as crucial to the success of students, staff and our broader community in not only addressing the impacts of of climate change, but also improving health and safety. At the most recent CCRC meeting, which is Climate Crisis Response Committee, our student committee members reported the sobering reality that young people in our schools are feeling hopelessness that goes far beyond the malaise we might consider typical to the transition into a talk like these Feelings are caused in part by feeling powerless in the face of climate change. This should not be the news to any of us because it has been widely reported that young people are experiencing vast challenges that previous generations have not. The unprecedented conditions, ranging from from health and environmental crises to social and political upheaval, are having deep consequences. Our students are telling us that the work of the CCRP is of critical importance to them. The damage the January snowstorm caused to several buildings is an example of the pressing need, not only because of the disruption it caused cause to the loss of use of buildings, but also to the mental stress of disrupted learning. Weather events like those in January, be it wildfire, smoke, mint, extreme and prolonged heat or cold, are more frequent because of climate change and will continue. Our students need us to find solutions now. We have an enormous opportunity to build on the work of the CCRP by continuing to innovate and by resourcing the work through a combination of thoughtful, calculated and continued investments. As stated in the 2023 CCRC board report, increasing staff capacity is critical to the success of this policy. Specifically, DPS needs more capacity to manage the sustainability and climate Resilience infrastructure project envisioned by the CCRP and work to secure funds for implementing the plans, both crucial roles for the possibility to become reality. PPS is a national leader having already invested in and making remarkable progress through climate crisis response policy. We should acknowledge how truly inspiring this policy is and work to ensure it is enacted. We are here to say that there is hope and opportunity. Please support and fully resource the implementation of the ccrp. Thank you.

G: Hi, my name is Alice and I go to Lewis Elementary. Your choices to cut teachers at schools are affecting me. For example, our library assistant, Ms. Tori is an amazing member of our school, but her position as library assistant is being eliminated. Library assistants don't just fill bookshelves with books, they fill our hearts with memories. Ms. Tori reads us books about fun things and hard things. Ms. Tori teaches us history about racism to telling us to be proud of ourselves by reading books. She knows the names of every student at Lewis. Second, our music teacher is named Mr. J. Last year his decision was threatened to be cut but our principal fought back and saved him. This year his position was threatened again but he was saved. He may be threatened again next year. Why are you trying so hard to cut him? Many of the musicians I love, including Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin, I know because of Mr. J who plays their songs for us. Mr. J teaches us about more than music. He teaches us about musicians from all cultures. Mr. J has a after school club called Beam and Beats that has taught years of kids. Many kids love that after school program including me. If you cut some of Mr. J's hours, you take that away from me and many other kids. Many teachers I have learned to value and respect have been cut. Cutting teachers means bigger class sizes. At Lewis we have two fifth grade classes with 32 kids in each class. This causes stress for the teachers. Your choices are not just affecting me. Your choices are affecting my whole school school and other schools too. My teachers are not just teachers but part of our community. Like the great Aretha Franklin that Mr. J taught me about. You should R E S P E C T teachers. My name is Leo Hibbard I'm 11 years old and I go to Kairos PDX. I have cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy is hard. A disability makes it hard for me to walk and run and affects my handwriting. As school kids bother me. Adapted PE teachers make me feel like I can do things other kids can do at P.E. i feel like and makes me feel like an athlete. I think it isn't fair to go for adapted PE teachers. They helped me and many other kids need help. I encourage you to focus on special education students. I feel like Portland Public Schools is not caring about them as much as they should. I suggest PPS to support them being kinder to kids with disabilities by giving them all the time and resources they could possibly give. Cutting adaptive PTS with its minutes kids health exercise and health regimen. I think that the district should find different areas to make hands up and going out of the way to make it so special education kids don't have the right educations going too far. All of us deserve the same treatment and respect and exercising how far we need special education kids need DRP teachers because all children should have an education that they get treated like everybody else because kids are the future of the America no matter their differences.

D: Thank you Chair Hollins so this is a policy that had its first reading in August and then the committee took a break this fall. We didn't have committee meetings leading up to and during this strike. Lots of our staff and both here at the central office and our buildings and were focused on reaching a settlement. But when we came back we considered public comment that we received and recommended that this be both first read and approved by the full board. It came out of committee with a unanimous vote. Essentially what the It's a very short policy. Essentially what this does is in the past class sizes at focus option schools were not consistent aligned with neighborhood schools staffing guidelines and this new language represents the changes that have since we discovered that they weren't aligned the district has made adjustments. So this policy now aligns with current district practice which is that we have a district wide staffing model related to class sizes and class targets and that's what the policy says that we just want the consistent practice that those staffing levels will be set at the district level versus at the building level. And so we did receive some comments on it in committee and we considered it and we are recommending that the district continue this practice of setting district. The policy aligning with current practice which is staffing being set at the district level versus at individual school levels.

G: Culturally and linguistically diverse students, adaptive PE and Board Certified behavior analysts. First, the SPED Department is trying to make too many changes too quickly and without a clear communicated plan, this will likely have a direct negative impact on our students. It doesn't make sense to move toward a neighborhood school model, essentially spreading the students in the district with the highest and most specialized needs across more schools and onto the caseloads of teams that are less experienced in these areas while simultaneously cutting the staff who can provide supports. The need for consultation and trainings will likely increase across the district with the implementation of the neighborhood schools model. Additionally, speech language pathologists who support the vast majority of these students will see a 10% rise in the number of.

G: Than one of these teams, will have their school experiences disproportionately impacted. The cuts to these teams are being advertised as central office cuts, which is misleading as we all work directly in schools across the district to support students and help their teams put plans in place to meet their specific needs, whether that be to ensure that they can eat safely at school without choking, communicate their basic needs and build social connections with peers using a communication device, access their education given the appropriate supports and tools, or to ensure that students from diverse or non English speaking backgrounds are being accurately identified for special education. I've also been told by SPED administrators that they're cutting these teams because we need to build capacity in buildings. But how does cutting the few SPED support positions we have in the district support this goal? When I go to schools to support AAC or communication device users, I'm not working in a vacuum. I involve the student and the team. My goal is to provide ideas that will benefit the particular student as well as leave their team more knowledgeable than before. My consultation collaborating with past SLPs on the assistive technology team increased my AAC knowledge. Eliminating these supports will likely decrease capacity in buildings, especially given the rapid advances in technology occurring today and the ever evolving nature of assistance to technology. Finally, it's incredibly frustrating that after nearly two months of asking for clarity around the plan for feeding an AT and the impact on school based staff, we're still met with so many unanswered questions. Even Mr. Buno's memo and presentation to you on March 5th does not clearly lay out how feeding an AT needs is documented in students. Legally mandated IEPs will be met starting next year. I understand that administrators have a lot on their plates, but communication is a crucial leadership skill and the lack of communication with staff in the larger community is not indicative of capable leadership. To claim to want to embrace and emphasize the expertise of our school based professionals and then completely disregard the input.

F: Good evening. My name is Ann Chinot C H E N O T I'm a teacher at Clarendon Head Start in North Portland and I've been a PPS parent for the past 15 years. I'm here to advocate for the Art Enrichment program and Head Start. While reductions in art FTE are happening across the district, our art program has been completely eliminated. Teacher Julia and Teacher Tara have created a high quality curriculum for our youngest artists. Reaching 600 students every week. They travel between nine schools and 36 classrooms every every week bringing all of their art materials with them. Head Start serves our youngest and most vulnerable students. Our students are three to five years old and are living at or below the poverty line. They are multilingual and are diverse in race and culture. Head Start prioritizes enrollment for students that are in foster care, experiencing homelessness and that receive special ed services. Art is truly transformative and healing for our students. In our program we have many students impacted by trauma and poverty. Art is a medium that is accessible for all of our students. Art transcends language barriers and it is accessible for our students that are neurodivergent and have disabilities. Our students are able to communicate and express their thoughts and feelings through their art. Many of these students are non verbal or do not have anyone in their class that speaks the same language as them. Art gives them a voice and a way to feel successful and seen. At school we always have students that struggle to find their calm and to self regulate throughout the day. Many of these students exhibit extreme and unsafe behaviors. But as the year progresses, we watch as these students find their calm while using clay or painting to jazz. Just yesterday I watched as every 3 to 5 year old child in my class pa painted quietly for 30 minutes mesmerized using sumi ink and a fude brush from Japan. These types of lessons are something that I as a classroom teacher simply cannot replicate. I do not have the time, experience or materials. Tara and Julia have created lessons that are joyful, engaging and culturally responsive. Our students learn how to use high quality art material and have experiences with collage, three dimensional art, printmaking, oil pastels, painting and fiber arts just just to name just a few. But most importantly, they see themselves represented. Every one of my students will tell you that they are an artist because every week they learn about modern and historical art from Black, Brown, Indigenous, Latino, Latina and Asian art artist. We know that research shows that early childhood is the most important time in a child's life for brain development. I ask you to please reconsider eliminating this amazing program from our Head Start classrooms. This is an easy choice and our most vulnerable students are counting on you. Thank you for your time.

We will have a brief update from our search firm on the draft criteria for the next superintendent which we will first which was first reviewed and discussed at our 5pm special meeting we had before this one.

We have tonight second reading that came out of the committee and we have three first readings that will consider the diploma policy, district wide advocacy and fundraising and the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps and military careers. In addition, I should note we have a meeting on April 11th in which I would encourage people, if they have a point of view on any of those committees to submit public comment. We'll be considering it. We'll also have an expanded public comment at that meeting. We normally have five slots but we'll make allocate slots for each of the policies so that people have an opportunity if they want to directly comment to the committee. I also wanted this isn't a committee but we have the. I'm gonna make a plug for the local option. That's okay. You got that?

B: Yeah, I mean, just a little continuation of previous stuff as well as some new stuff. We are always continuing talking about graduation requirements, what it means to have a graduate degree. How do you increase graduation rate but also increase robustness or rigor? That's a challenge that we forever have. One of the big discussions that we continue to have is about proficiency based grading, which honestly DPS is 10 years behind, which everyone here admits, and how to implement that effectively and allow us to be able to provide exception and education for all our kids. The most recent meeting was very focused on the issue with the Japanese unmanned residency trips and trying to problem solve around that. And we are bumping into a lot of difficulties and it's something that we may have to have a separate discussion about in the policy committee and to try to figure out what we can do to make sure that we are providing the best for all our students. There are. The purpose of the policy makes sense to protect everybody. But you know, it's also one of those things that we as humans are complicated and so is life and sometimes things need a little adjustment. So I think that's something we should.

C: All right, next is the facilities and Operations Committee. We had a discussion and we're hearing another update tonight about the Jefferson High School modernization. We had a presentation from Ida B. Wells planning. We talked about the bond planning and some of the priorities that we're looking for for our bond planning. And then we have a update, a brief update about the profit center relocation. All right, so next we will actually talk about the local option levy. I will turn it over to Director Brewers.

start time: 1553:58:30.000
end time: 1575:21:20.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Okay, so I just want to highlight for the community once again, we have on the May ballot renewal of our local option levy. And importantly, it's a renewal. It's not an increase in the tax rate. And that Levy funds approximately 650 teachers a year and produces about $100 million in revenue for the district in addition to the funds we get from the state. It's been further than May ballot. I want to thank all the parents, teachers, school staff, students, elected officials who signed onto voter pamphlet statements in support of it. And we're actively raising money, communicating with our school communities and know how important this measure is to our, to our school community and the funding of our individual schools. So we'll have probably the next couple weeks ways in which people can connect to our upcoming volunteer efforts across the district. As we get ready for the May 21st election.

C: Thank you. Earlier this evening we had a special meeting where the board had opportunity to review and discuss the draft for the criteria of the next superintendent, which resulted from input received through community engagement phase of the process. We have asked Hank hearings to join us this evening to briefly share the criteria. For those of you who did not tune in into the 5pm study session, we had a, I believe almost between 16 and 1800 people who turned in the survey. And so I will turn it over to Mr. Hank Harris.

B: Chair Hollins, forward. Good to see you again in terms of husk as well. Thank you. I'll keep my remarks short since we spent considerable time at the work session earlier this evening, but I do want to share, particularly with the public, a deep thanks for the over 1800 Portlanders who provided input into the next superintendent criteria, whether through focus groups or the survey. And that criteria is in draft form. It is available on the website, both on the district's boards page and also on the superintendent recruitment page. And there's also an opportunity, of course, to provide input for any member of the public, whether that's through public testimony at next week's board meeting or easier through an email that you'll see on the superintendent search page. So we'll look forward to that. Other than that, I want to. I want to turn this back over to you, Chair Hollins, to see if there are any additional board questions or comments that I could provide input on.

start time: 1605:26:40.000

start time: 1607:06:20.000
end time: 1631:37:40.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yes, I don't have that screen up, but give me one moment and I will be. I will do that with you. So in terms of the next superintendent criteria, there are five key areas that you'll see, and these are These M&A1 individuals who share with us, please, what are they hoping that the board will focus on in terms of the next superintendent criteria? I'm looking from the side, so that's why you see me turning my head to my monitor. One is about authentic and inclusive leadership. One is about transparent, ethical and courageous leadership. One is about experienced, strategic and visionary educational leadership. One is about fiscal stewardship and advocacy leadership. And one is about equity and cultural competency leadership. And for the public, if you do go to the superintendent, if you go to either of those pages on the website, whether that's the board page or the superintendent search page, you'll see not only the next superintendent criteria, which I just outlined, is the Dreams and aspirations document. That's what that is. But in addition, there's an executive summary document which speaks about what we've learned as about PPS at this moment in time in terms of what is, what are the. What are the strengths of the organization and what are the challenges and complexities of the organization. And so I encourage you to look through those as well.

C: The board is scheduled to adopt the criteria that we will use at our next superintendent April 9. We encourage the community come out, give public comment. I would love to see this money out for the pick of our next superintendent as we are for some of the folks that's here, individual interest. So that would be great if you guys can come out and we can have this type of turnout around picking our next superintendent. All right, so next we have updates on the modernization of Jefferson High School. This past December, the board approved resolution 6802 which directed the superintendent to reassess the current site and building design so that Jefferson High School students and staff could avoid relocating to a swing site during construction. The resolution call for the superintendent to return to the Board of Education within an updated plan to modernize. Modernize Jefferson High School. Superintendent Huss, would you introduce this item?

I understand that the board has requested a plan to accommodate targeted student enrollment. 1700 keep students and staff largely on the Jefferson High School campus during construction, demolish the original 1909 building, conform to.

Thank you for the opportunity for our project team to present the status of Jefferson High School's redesign or what our project team has come to known as Project Pivot. I'd like to start welcome with some team introductions. My name is Armin Malazo, School of Office with the Office of School Modernization for Jefferson High School. First with us is Keisha Locklear who's a senior project manager in OSM for Jefferson Modernization. Also with us here today is Steffi Knudsen representing Bora Lever Design team and Brad Nile representing the Anderson Construction team and their consortium partners. Here's our agenda for this evening. During this presentation, we will compare the old plan with the new plan, review main components of the new plan, show some conceptual diagrams for the layout of the new building, discuss athletic program impacts during construction, look for feedback from the community on our community outreach plan, detail the current plan for permitting and review the project schedule and budget. I now hand this over to Kesha who will discuss the comparison of the old plan with the new plan.

confidence: 0.95
F: Thank you, Armand. Here we show the old plan versus the new plan. The key to this change in project strategy was first and foremost listening to the community's concerns surrounding the previous design requiring students to swing off site. We heard that and have adjusted our design approach. And so we now recommend building north of the existing buildings closer to Killingsworth. As directed by the school board. This will require building an all new building on the track and field and.

F: Jefferson High School when the project is complete. This is a similar approach to the Lincoln Modern Next slide. The project team has been primarily in a process of information gathering as we reorient ourselves to building on the new on a new area of the site. We have been careful to incorporate feedback from previous engagement with the community. We have also met with district departments such as the Home Security, Jefferson Administration and Visual and Performing Arts for them to understand how the major zones of the building are accessed. We also spoke with the City of Portland on requirements such as the cross block connection between the building and Fields, which is also a similar approach to Lincoln design. The current program components have the main entry on Kirby, the arts programs, activating the street on Killingsworth and maintaining athletics along commercial. I'll hand this over now to Steffi from Bora Architects to talk about planned test fits.

F: The purple at the north side indicates the arts program along Killingsworth and the yellow along the right hand side and along commercial is the athletics program. It's important to note this is not a design. This is really an exercise that helps us understand how things will fit, understand potential costs and helps us find challenges for the due diligence before we start the design process. I'm going to turn this back over to osm.

F: So one program area greatly affected by construction on our occupied site is athletics. We are still in the process of discussing program implications with various construction and staging scenarios with athletics. But currently the plan is that the 1964 gym main gym building will be open for the entire duration of construction until the new gym is open and then. But once construction starts, the football field and track will not be available during construction for four years from the fall.

F: And we are still studying options for the interim fields to the south that balance cost, schedule impacts and athletic program support to best serve the students and staff. Next slide here you will see what we have proposed as a community outreach plan and we are looking for feedback on this strategy from the Board. In addition to our community updates that we have been emailing monthly which you can find on our Jefferson Modernization website, we've also been meeting with internal district staff, Jefferson staff as well as students. This plan you see proposes to expand engagement outside of those traditional groups. We believe that the design advisory group engagement to date has been too limited.

F: That this project needs. We are proposing to evolve our engagement beyond the DAG and expand our outreach to be community wide. This list represents the categories of community that we will be engaging with and are hopeful to work with the center for Black Excellence Advisory Committee to engage with their partner organizations. I will now hand it to Armand who will discuss the permitting process.

E: Thank you, Kesha Our new plan requires a different approach to land use and permitting. The design still is required to be reviewed by the Historic Landmarks Commission and requires a special conditional use review. Since our new approach will require a demolition of the extension existing 1909 building which is considered a contributing resource to the Piedmont Conservation District, there is an approval process for that demolition. The HLC has indicated that due to the changes made to the building in the 1950s, they will support the demolition if we remove the contributing status from the 1909 building. The timeline you see here reflects a sequence to remove that contributing status. There is a risk to the project timeline during the appeal period or if the HLC does not approve the change in that status. However, we are still moving forward with this process and our next steps are to submit the application to remove the contributing status. Next Slide this slide shows the anticipated project design, land use permitting and construction schedule. Building construction will begin in the fall of 2025 after we finish the new building and move students to start school in a new building. In fall of 2028, we'll demolish the existing building and finish the athletic fields. The athletic fields will be completed and ready for use in late summer 2029. Next Slide this slide shows the budget and is based on the new hard cost estimate provided by Anderson Construction and is split into hard cost and soft cost. You will recognize this format because it is a format OSM used for every comprehensive plan for hard cost. Parallel Estimate Parallel estimates were prepared and reconciled by Anderson Construction in an independent cost estimator, rlb, based on their review of the new site and building construction components. The $407 million figure at the top is Anderson Construction's all in number for construction and they will be sharing more details of their estimate process during this pivot period phase. That number also includes all of the state required 1.5% green energy technology and are additional owner allowances included for significant right of way improvements and abatement costs. The soft costs are based on both leveraging design and engineering work that has already occurred as well as planning for owner costs that reflect the latest cost data we have from recent projects escalated to current dollars. There is contingency within the overall project budget that equals 10% of the total project costs based on requirements for new construction and the overall escalation of the hard costs that are shown here through the middle of construction are included in the hard cost estimate. Next slide please. The slides show a further breakdown of current budget actuals to date and additional budget required based on the overall current budget estimate. The additional budget required based on these costs is about $125 million above the current budget and funding for this project. I'll now hand this over to Brad Nile from Anderson Construction who will discuss the details of their estimating process. So I'm here representing Anderson Construction and our consortium partners who are members of the Jefferson community and these consortium partners for their PPS's goal of opening opportunities for underrepresented firms. They've been part of this process from the beginning and they have provided valuable insights to the team. What you're looking at on this slide expands the hard cost estimating detail with specific budget Categories from the 1922 excuse me, the 2022 estimate on the left that precedes Anderson involvement in this project and Anderson's most recent estimate shown on the right. Note that there are two years of evaluation, investigation, dialogue and dialogue that has occurred between these two breakdowns. During that time, we have continuously collaborated with the third party estimating firm responsible for the pricing on the left and reconciled our pricing with them at several milestones throughout the project. Anderson and our consortium partners are responsible for the pricing on the right and we offer four key points regarding this process. First, we have approached our estimating work with a deep understanding of the intended scope, including the PPS ED spec, PPS Climate Action Plan, PPS Resiliency Initiative, the current structural building code requirements which have changed compared to other recent high school projects, and relevant and current hazardous material abatement needs for the demolition of the existing campus which were not included in the original 2022 estimate. Second point we've selected key trade partners. Note that this was through a competitive process. They have provided to us relevant and current pricing for the following complex scopes associated with this project Mass, timber structure, masonry, exterior panel, wall framing, elevators, plumbing and mechanical fire protection, electrical fire alone, audiovisual IT and security. These scopes represent 38% of the current estimated direct hard cost. Note that these estimated scopes represent current market conditions and these scopes have escalated higher than the rates predicted in the 2022 budget. Our consortium partners have also participated and provided pricing for the scopes of abatement, demolition, earthwork site, concrete framing, drywall and plaster. These scopes represent 14% of the cost of work. Third point, we've accounted for the complexity and safety measures necessary to build the new Jefferson while the campus is occupied. This contributes to additional general conditions and general requirements that were not assumed in the 2022 budget. And finally, we have used compounding inflation multipliers to forecast where the market will be at the midpoint of construction, which is August of 2027. This is two years later than previously anticipated. These multipliers include 7% for 2024, 6% for 2025, 5% for 2026, and 4% to August of 2027. As you can imagine, those compounding inflation rates add to the bottom line, and the additional two years of time has added significant cost to the project. As a note, if you were to apply these inflationary rates to the cost of Lincoln High School would be very close to our cost per square foot represented here. We have full detail available that elaborates on the cost categories that you see on this slide and specifically those with the greatest difference between the 2022 and the 2024 estimates. I'll hand it back to OSM. Thank you, Brad. And thanks again to the board for the opportunity to present this project pivot. And we welcome your questions.

F: I had other questions about the schedule. I don't know if you can go back, but There's a type 2 land use review. Then there's a type 3 conditional use. Then there's a. I didn't write it out. Then there's a type 2 land use. And some of those have appeals after them. Are those definite appeals or have we just added time into the system schedule in case there's an appeal? In case there's appeal needed, we've added time for the potential appeal. Some of those could overlap. There are processes that could allow that. But what we're showing here are the various timelines. And we like to submit after appeal period is over.

F: And I understand that this is a conservative schedule, but is there. Is there a way to tighten up some of those land use to run parallel process? We have talked, I think, do they need to be sequential? We've talked with the city about those questions, and they really don't like it when we Run them concurrently. And then we found that that was not a critical path for the project for us to do so.

D: So first I want to thank the team for embracing the pivot. I know when first I was like, this is pause. It's like no pivot because that still projects forward motion, which is I think what we all wanted. And I know when the community realized that students would have to leave the campus and what that might, the impact that that might have on the student body that this whole team really pivoted. So thank you very much for bringing forward something that I think meets the needs of the community and also complies with the ED specs and builds a beautiful new facility for our students in Jefferson. So I want to thank you because I know how hard it was to do that. It wasn't just like, hey, come up with a new plan. I did have one question, two questions. One is the. I'm looking at the one frame that had the second and third stories and I'm just wondering why in that one space there's not sort of stack. Yeah, that one. Why there's not stacking in the second, the second and third floor, third and fourth floors. It looks like you have programming. Is it because it's the gym?

F: So thank you. I just have one, one last comment about the community engagement and that colocate has done an amazing job talking to community members and students and teaching that class to the students, the design class. And I hope that they'll still be involved in some of this expanded work with community partners. There's a lot happening between the Interstate Firehouse Cultural center and the Soul Restoration Center. There's this kind of. I don't know how to describe a necklace of, you know, string of arts organizations and community based organizations that are all kind of, you know, trying to bring a black art, a black culture. Exactly. Interstate. We're still developing the scope for this pivot with our design team fleshing it out. But the plan right now is to involve colocate in cultural place making for Jefferson High School and really helping to create the identity of the place in keeping with the community and using them and their skills and how deeply entrenched they already are in the community as the advantage in that exercise. That's great. I'm also really thrilled to see see the school fronting Killingsworth. Yeah, it's really cool. I know there's a lot of pushback, but having a porch and an entryway really is inviting the community in and shows the students that we care about them. I think it's really great.

B: This is not so much a question for the team, more a comment to the board. And it's what I made a few months ago. I'm supportive of building this high school for 1700. I think it's the right direction to go. The board has given that pretty clear direction. What we haven't really done is talk about what that's going to mean. And I don't think the community's quite internalized what that means. It means redrawing high school district boundaries and doing so relatively quickly. And we know that will be a highly political and contentious process. And so I'm flagging that for two reasons. One, I think the community should know as we're moving forward on this, what that. But I think the board should also know what that's going to mean. And we're going to need to do some direction to the superintendent relatively soon in terms of what that process looks like, the timeline, the engagement, because we're going to be redrawing boundaries for hundreds of households in order to fill Jefferson, which is again, I think it's the right direction, the direction we should go. It's going to require some bravery on the board. I just want to keep calling that.

F: Yeah, I appreciate that. I live within the within. You know, my kids could choose. We could choose to go to Jefferson. But when I attended Jefferson, I had to live with my grandmother for a couple years so I could attend the school. And I feel like if you buy a house in that neighborhood like it's been gentrified over the last four decades, five decades. You know, you should send your kids to the school and the school should be as great as any other school to draw the students in. So it's going to be a hard process. And I think, you know, I'm looking down 20 years when we have a full, you know, fully enrolled high school with people thriving. But you're right, that's going to be a hard conversation.

D: The first readings are essentially introductions and the second readings are adoption. So to the introduction of three policies that came out of the policy committee. And the first one is diploma requirements. Okay, so the first policy was related to diploma requirements. It came out of the committee with the unanimous recommendation for first reading and the introduction. The 2023 Oregon Legislature enacted a number of changes to graduation requirements, including extending a pause on the essential skills requirement until 2027. Additionally requires students beginning with the class of 2027 to complete 0.5 credits to personal financial education and higher education career path skills to satisfy deployment requirements. This policy was in the policy committee and then it went over to Chelang's Student Success Committee for some discussion and as you referenced earlier tonight, discussion about what should we require of our students for graduation. I want to be clear that there's more work to be done around the diploma requirements, around what our expectations are for our students. We wanted to move ahead with this piece because the legislature has acted and it's useful for our families and students if they look at our policy to see an accurate depiction of what the graduation requirements are. But we expect potentially more to come from the student Success Committee. There wasn't any public comment on this particular measure. I will say we had an earlier version that just removed the essential skills, but we decided because the legislature has paused it, which that was a previous requirement, graduation requirement, we put it back in and it's footnoted that the legislature has just paused it because we want to leave in the expectation that there may be essential skills or sort of base level requirements where the legislature may restore them. So that is the diploma requirements policy that for sred. Again, if anybody wants to comment on it, it'll be both posted and you also can come to the April 11 policy committee meeting if you want to comment on them. Okay, the next policy is the district wide advocacy and fundraising policy. This policy came out of the committee with the support of a unanimous recommendation, including the support of Student Representative Silverstein to bring it to the board for first reading or introduction and into the public comment period. This is a policy change that's been discussed, debated and worked on since at least 2017. It wasn't a rushed or secretive process. We've had many public meetings. We've heard a whole variety of perspectives from our community on this particular policy and the practice. And just as background Post Ballot Measure 5 in the mid-1990s, PPS supported the establishment of a district wide foundation, the Portland Schools foundation, which was a driving force both in Salem and in Portland. For better funding, the Portland Schools foundation created district wide calls for actions and results. They generated actions in which thousands of Portland parents marched in the streets and marched on Salem. They raised the level of the state school fund, established the concept of a local option which we're now taking advantage of four times which provides about 100 million a year for us. The foundation in the 2002 and 2003 recession that helped lead they helped lead the efforts to pass a local income tax surcharged so we didn't have to cut five weeks from the school year and have the shortest school year in the nation. The Pronoun School foundation also housed local school foundations which were allowed to raise funds for staff for their individual schools. The Portland Schools foundation was a leader in the state and pressuring Salem to do more and better. Since that time and because of the efforts of the Portland Schools foundation, our labor partners, thousands of parents, the Coalition for the School Funding now for school funding. Now we have a local option. The art tax ballot measured 98 to be for CTE several bonds providing more than $2 billion in funding, including some that took pressure off our operational budgets which allows us to buy textbooks and pay for it with bond funds versus operating dollars. We also have the Student Success act which created a new corporate tax for schools. We still need Salem to do better, full stop. We all agree on that and because of our local efforts and the district wide foundation and the efforts that parents and our labor partners, community members joined in on in a collective action, we now have art, music, PE CT in all our schools. Social workers, psychologists, climate specialists, restorative justice staff, campus safety associates, new curriculum, lower class sizes at most of our schools and many other school based supports that didn't exist in the late 1990s when we started the district wide foundation that also allowed for local school fundraising. The transparent inequity that exists in some when some schools are able to pay for staff with individual school raise funds and others are not is apparent. There's been a robust discussion about whether to continue practice or to focus on a collective impact model and build out a more robust district wide foundation fundraising effort. There are many policy committee meetings when this has been discussed and I want to thank Director DePass who asked that we hold focus groups to hear more from those we don't often hear from. And because of that, in 202022 roundtables were held from schools without foundations representing school communities with students who are marginalized. Staff invited community members and Director Green. Chair Hollins also recommended parent leaders to participate the roundtables. In addition with district staff, a principal survey was conducted.

D: Practice from individual school fundraising for their own schools and move to a district wide fundraising platform. In 2022 we had two full work sessions on topic and policy Committee Chair Lowry held committee meetings on potential changes as well. On May 31st of that year, Chair Lowry, as we were wrapping up the school year, was not able to move forward with any recommended changes. So via email she asked Chair Hollins and myself to connect and talk through options for draft foundation policy and that she looked forward to our creativity and innovation in this daunting matter. So a couple months later when Director Hollins became Chair and I became the Policy Committee Chair, we had this as part of our committee work plan leading up to and during the strike. Our committee and most other committees didn't meet. After the strike was settled, this topic was again on our agenda. In the policy committee. Different options were considered that could result in more equitable fundraising and staffing supports for our schools. Over the past several months we considered two options, one which retained some individual school fundraising and one that shipped shifted to a district wide fundraising model. They were posted and discussed in committee. The policy draft that we have Tonight that is being first read. Option number one shifts to a district wide foundation model for fundraising for staff versus an individual school fundraising model. PPS is a foundation that has a district wide mission. The fund for PPS which could serve as the district wide foundation role or another 501 could also perform that role. Other changes included in the policy elevating the advocacy for public schools as an important role once again for the district wide Foundation. Knowing that we're stronger together when we show up in Salem when we're marching in the streets. We also know we also built in a process for how distributions from district wide fundraising could be could be made based on a questioning committee from Director Sullivan. It also encourages parent and individual school school groups to register with the district wide foundation so that we can again mobilize all of the various groups that want to support our individual schools and our students whether they're booster clubs, PTAs, foundations so that we have a really strong base that together we can not only go to Salem but also advocate for public schools together. Schools that have the school communities that both the capacity to raise money at their own schools but also those that don't. I also want to thank a very important thing in this policy draft which we've had questions about. It also acknowledges that all money raised by individual schools right now for this school year will be allowed to pay for staff the 20 school year. So there's a long Runway for us to shift to a district wide foundation model. I want to thank and acknowledge Chair Hollins for jump starting the process for planning how we could enhance and accelerate district wide foundation fundraising. There'll be a draft planning process posted with policy committee materials next week and we welcome the community engagement and helping build a stronger district wide advocacy and fundraising capabilities. This can be a forward together. The committee spent time reviewing other foundation models in Oregon and PPS and PPS was the sole outlier that allowed individual school communities to raise money to fund staff at their individual schools. All other districts in Oregon again we're the only district in the state that allows it. All of the districts either did not allow it or required fundraising for staff to happen at the district level and there be an equitable distribution of funding to purchase staff at all schools. This is not a replacement. I want to just be absolutely clear this is not a replacement for strong advocacy in Salem for better funded schools. Since 1997 when I chaired the Citywide Coalition for school Funding now advocating for more robust statewide school funding following I've been involved in every statewide school funding measure, including helping lead the building of the Student Success Act. We all need to work together because that's where our power is going to be. And we'll have more equitable fundraising and supports for our students across the district. We need to build a strong statewide advocacy effort and PPS has and can lead in that. And we can also have equitable district wide foundation fundraising that provides additional local funds for schools. At the next policy committee, we'll have expanded slots for public comments on this public policy because I know that people have very strong feelings about this and we want to allow people to share their thoughts, ideas and recommendations for us. And I just want to be clear, we'll have enough slots that in individuals on both sides of the issue can.

start time: 2306:41:20.000
end time: 2343:12:00.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Yes, I do. The first people to contact me when I became a member of the board were foundation people from both sides of the question. Both had reasonable arguments for their sign. Both care about their schools and other schools in the district. I have seen materials about the meetings last spring and Julia talked about quite a few of those and that's when people started talking and instead of blaming. And I have seen requests for getting together with a group like Innovation Studio and coming up with a plan for a district wide fundraiser that would help everyone. But this policy is not that it does not really help anyone at this point, but it does take away whatever small amount might be raised for that extra paraprofessional or library aide that can make a real difference to a classroom or a school. There is no plan for how district wide fundraising might work. There is no plan for how the money would be raised or how it would be allocated. As one email I received stated, if we raise money and don't know where it will go, it is just another tax. There is no reason to rush this process, especially in a time when every dollar counts. It will take time, staff and resources to create an effective district wide foundation. This policy change deserves a thoughtful process that includes all the voices in the community. What we need is enough money for every school so that we don't need fundraisers at all. We need to put pressure on the state for the QEM and the federal government to get needed dollars promised for special education. We also have a levy election coming up on May 21, which has already been mentioned, and a bond in the fall. Let's put our energy there and maybe we can get to a place where there is less need for fundraisers at all. But taking them away now with no actual replacement in place, in my opinion, will harm students. Thank you.

B: Thanks. So I'll just start by saying I support changes to our foundation policy. As I've said before, the ability of one community to provide services at one school that schools don't receive violates our racial equity and social justice values. And I've always said in continuity believe that we should engage in a thoughtful and collaborative process to make changes to this policy. And that's one reason I'm frustrated by the policies that's before us tonight for our first reading. The process for developing this policy change was not thoughtful, it was not inclusive, and it was not collaborative. It was not focused on building community consensus or lifting up all of our schools. But instead it was focused on finding a villain. And like so many issues locally and nationally, people are intentionally separated into computer competing sides instead of working together towards a common solution. Social media contributes to and amplifies this dynamic and we're all worse off as a result. Tonight, the board has a choice. We can move this policy forward and contribute to that division, or we can truly be inclusive and collaborative in a way that disrupts it. Our current practice around individual school fundraising has the potential to create inequities. At the same time, it bears repeating that parents who have raised millions of dollars to provide additional services to PPS students ensure 30% of those dollars with other schools have done nothing wrong. They have worked hard to fill in the gaps left by our state legislature. And they've done so in the only way they know how, by raising money to add a part time librarian or educational assistant or music teacher that benefits not just their child, but the entire school, including the underserved students who attend every PBS school. Chair Hollins made an effort in spring of 2023 to bring the two sides together. And despite my initial skepticism, it seemed to have a real impact. People on opposing side started meeting in real life. It became clear that everyone wants the same thing for our kids. And while we may disagree about how to get there, the dialogue was and remains important. Unfortunately, the goodwill that was created by that meeting was lost in September when Director Vermetters invited foundation reform advocates to submit a policy for consideration that did not include in play from those who have concerns about what their schools and their students may lose. That decision broke the trust that was being built, and subsequently each side retreated to their respective corners. As a result, we've wasted the last year amplifying divisions in our community instead of working to bridge them. I asked the Policy Committee in September to use PPS's Innovation Studio to engage in a truly collaborative process and report back to the board this spring. In fact, they would have been reporting back to the board right now. I never heard back on that suggestion. I've been asked why, if I believe this policy should change, that I don't support this change. One of the first things that we teach public Policy and Public administration students is the impact of unintended consequences. History is rife with examples of well meaning policy changes that backfired spectacularly. This policy change done in this way will backfire on the district. Many months ago I said that our existing foundation policy is racist. By that I meant and mean that it contributes to the systemic racism that infects so much of our society and our districts. I stand by that statement, but advocates for change have tried to use those words against me to argue that as a result, I have to support their changes immediately. And I want to tell a very personal story about why they are wrong. So In March of 2004, my mom married her partner of over 10 years. And that may not sound remarkable to many people, but prior To March of 2004, it had been illegal for same sex couples to marry. In March of 2004, the Multoma County Board of Commissioners decided that denying same sex couples the right to marry violated the Oregon Constitution, and so they started issuing marriage marriage licenses. Many Oregonians will remember what happened next with multiple legal challenges, different rulings, different interpretations. Ultimately, Multnomah County's actions were struck down by the Supreme Court and those marriage licenses, including my mom's, were revoked. More importantly than that, however, In November of 2004, a ballot measure passed 57% to 43%, enshrining in the Oregon Constitution that marriage is between one man and one woman. This is an example of unintended consequences. The statute that prohibited my mother from getting married was discriminatory and it was wrong. It did actual real harm to my family. And while I appreciate the motivation behind the Multoma County Commission's attempts to correct that wrong by doing so in the way they did, they caused a backlash that turned what had been a statutory discrimination against the LGBTQIA community into a constitutionally protected discrimination, their actions made the situation worse for gays and lesbians in Oregon, including my family. Now, this board does have the authority to make this change and it will not be overturned by a court. But if the change we make results in worse outcomes for our students, including underserved students at impacted schools, have we done any good? Are have we passed a performative policy that makes us feel like we've done something good, as I'm sure Multnomah county commissioners felt? But in reality, sex backs the cause we were striving for. I also want to address the argument that passing this policy as usual somehow changed the dynamic around state funding of education. There is no evidence for that, and when I asked advocates to provide justification for this claim, they were unable to. In actuality, I think we have evidence to the contrary. This community was incredibly mobilized and activated by the teacher strike last fall, and a large contingent of parents traveled to Salem during the short session to advocate for PPS funding. I greatly admire their efforts and I hope it results in something in the future. But I want to point out that not only did the legislature not fund PPS's request for $30 million to offset the cuts that we have to make as a result of the PAT contract, the legislature also cut PPS out of the summer school funding formula completely. I want to repeat that the legislature also cut PPS out of the summer school funding formula completely, funding that we were counting on to help offset some of the learning loss our children have experienced this year. Passing this policy change will not change the dynamic in Salem. In the last policy committee meeting, Director Bim Edwards said that fundraising for staff is different than other fundraising because staff are, quote, the most important thing for student achievement. I agree. This policy change takes away staff from our students without having a pragmatic or practical approach to replacing them. In fact, when I asked Beth Kavanaugh how to respond to a parent who is concerned about losing staff, she acknowledged that a change will likely decrease staffing for schools that historically raised funding for their kids. And that's the rub. This policy will take something away from our kids, including the thousands of underserved students who attend those impacted schools. That is apparently the goal, and it does nothing to build a replacement system that lifts up all students. We're doing the easy work by changing the policy. We're not doing the hard work by building up the foundation. Why are we considering a policy that will take away something that we know is the most effective thing when it comes to school student achievement? With all of that, there's a better path. We can build a broad coalition where everyone agrees on the problem and we get general consensus on a solution. We can simultaneously Build our district wide fundraising apparatus in a way that grows the resources available to our students instead of reducing them. It will take time, effort and resources, but I'm confident we can create a process that does that. With that, I'd like to make a motion tonight to direct the superintendent to create an authentic engagement strategy using the Innovation Studio. Report back to the board in nine months with community led co created recommendations on how to move forward. I also moved to ask the student success committee to make recommendations to the board within 60 days on how to empower and appropriately resource the fund for bps.

D: I'd like to speak to that discussion. So we have had since 2017 dozens of meetings, many opportunities for board members to come to the meetings to offer things. And again you laid out a schedule which directed when you were the chair, Director Scott to direct, Director Ailey, Director Lowry to come up with the policy. And it was very clear we were going to consider. She was going to bring something out of committee. It was going to to be considered. It never came out of committee and it didn't come out of committee because we have this continual delay. So. And you've described this as controversial. Well, disrupting inequities is never easy and it's often controversial. But we should not further delay. We've already had five or six years delay. And I will just say for this that didn't receive. So the vast majority of our schools, including a lot of schools in East Portland and North Portland that don't have any Capacity to raise funds. Maybe they got a little crumb that was left over in the 1/3 because we divided the 1/3 by a lot of schools versus the 2/3 that stayed out of school. We had continuous delays and there's no need for further delay. I would say that what we should be directing the superintendent to do is actually come back with a plan for last year, all schools. And probably the first time there was some equitable discretionary staffing was the COVID Esser money, $8 million that went out for the first time. Lots of schools in my district in South Beach, Portland had an opportunity to do the things that other schools that parents, when there's robust parent fundraising could do, like buy a part of a PE teacher or bring art in or have a, you know, EAS in all the classrooms. Nobody has raised the fact and we know that it's not going to be in the budget next year, that what harm is that going to do to our students? And so to me this is just a measure to once again delay things. And actually when I had a conversation with the, I did have a conversation with Innovation Studio, they weren't going to start until January and they wouldn't have been able to bring anything that would have had an impact for the next year. So I would recommend that we stay the course. We've spent a lot of time in committee. We made a decision to move this out. Director Hollins has provided us with a platform that we can build on for a district wide fundraising plan. We have a whole year to work on it. And so I would ask my fellow board members to reject this motion and stay, stay the course.

F: No, just that I appreciate, you know, the comments that you've made and I feel like we're 170 years into the history of this district and seven years into the process. I think it's time to just rip the band aid off and make this change. And I appreciate you sharing your personal story, but I'm also a graduate of this system and went to schools that did not benefit from the fundraising, even didn't know about it. And so we, for the first time in history, we have a board that's diverse, racially diverse, and we have the.

B: Yeah. Also just a quick comment. I think your idea of having the student success committee explore ways to organize and fundraise is a great idea. I also agree with Michelle or Director Pass that, you know, it's part of human nature to when all your eggs are in one basket to go for it. You know, like I remember a musician I really respected and one of his fans asked him like, you know, how'd you make it in the music industry because it's so difficult. And he said, you just got to put it all in and that's all you got because humans are survivors. And that really stuck with me because it's one of those things where I think there's a lot of fear around this because it is change and change is always scary. I also want to put it out there that I don't want to villainize anyone. I know you mentioned this and it really hurts my heart. The parents that do organize these fundraising and stuff, they're allies, they're people of amazing resource and, and their fundraising for their schools are to be respected and appreciated. I want to bring them into the fold of a district wide vision. And this is why I want to talk about is a vision because it's scary because it's changed. But we also have to remember PPS is an outlier. There are other models for district wide foundations that we could easily adapt. So many districts across the country have a model that does successfully. The thing with local school foundations that is it's a limit. There's a real limit to it. There's only so much you can raise. But a district wide foundation, when all our eggs are in one basket, when everyone is working together, it can be not only a fundraising group but it can also be an advocacy group. Something that I, you know, when I go and talk to parents all across, especially the zone I represent, which is a lot of low income areas, a lot of parents don't have the resources to give. But there's so much drive they. One of the biggest questions I get all the time is like we want to be part of a big movement, we want to help PPs and stuff. Who do we go to? And I can't really give a straight up answer. And if we. The part of the vision that I foresee for us is that having a district wide one group is not only can be a fundraising group but an advocacy group. It can be a center point. We can, you can imagine as much as you want. And not only that, we can copy other people who have done it wrong. Right. We can have parents on the board, teachers on the board and people are power. And more people is more power. I use the wrong verb, are more power. Anyways. Yeah, thank you. It's on public record, so you can correct me later. So I think it is one of those situations where we are creatures of Survival. If you don't just rip off the manding, go for it. There's a risk it can never get done and we don't realize the potential. Thank you. And I do think of the idea of students exploring how to organize and get advocacy. It's a great idea.

F: Maybe there's even another committee in here similar. I just also want to recognize as a single parent, I was not able to participate in the fundraisers. I couldn't even afford the tickets even when they were $25. And so I was outside of looking in at the auction and all the fun things happening and couldn't, I couldn't go. I couldn't give a dollar. And so that's, you know, I feel like we need to include people, give them a way to participate that doesn't necessarily involve lots of money that they can volunteer their time and attention. So I appreciate your comments there.

confidence: 0.96
B: I just want to make one quick comment because I completely agree that the schools that don't have the capacity to raise funds are the schools we should be focused on. This policy does nothing to change that. And that's my concern with it is that it takes away from schools that are fundraising without replacing anything at the schools that aren't. And I think that's why it's a.

D: I'm just saying again, I'll have posted a district wide foundation fundraising plan and again it could be the fund for, for pps. And I know that you attended their meetings. They have a very small board. It's not inclusive of a lot of other. Either our parents or our larger community based organizations. And we can, I mean I believe in the potential and I saw it with the Portland Schools foundation. They had 30,000 people marching in the streets right after measure five. And I do believe we're way stronger together. And there is a potential replacement. And again I want to thank director Hollings for Holland's like Lionel Hollings for coming up with a draft. And I do think the partnership with the current fund board can be, can be built on. So I don't think we're replacing with nothing. And I will just remind you I will just say one of the things in this policy, it does allow then equity to continue for yet another year. And at the same time, all those schools that don't have foundations or get the 2/3 dollars are not going to get their Esser dollars this year, that $8 million. We don't have a again, so there will be harm this year. At the same time, we're going to allow them to continue because it's the.

F: Right thing to do.

start time: 2673:53:30.000
end time: 2706:51:10.000
confidence: 0.94
D: People have been raising money all year, and so I recognize that you don't just cut that off, But I think we need to recognize that harm's been happening for a long period of time. And I wish everybody had come to the roundtables and listened to parents talk about like we're like the pity parade if like the crumbs that we get from the wealthy schools. And like we're supposed to be satisfied with that. And frankly, they can buy like 4 or 5 EAs to support their students. And at the same time, we can't even raise, you know, we get like 10, could be 10 to $30,000, which doesn't allow us to like basically pay for anything. And so I would just say that this, it's gone on long enough and there's already been lots of harm. And I would hope we all represent the whole city, not just the zones that we're from. And that if you look at the districts, the schools that can raise the most money, they are predominantly the ones in the highest socioeconomic schools with the least diverse student bodies. And that's not to say that they don't have diversity students, but they have the least. And then if you look at the schools that get the equity grants, which are a pittance compared to what some of the other schools raise, they are predominantly students of color. They have large numbers of students who may speak a different language at home. And they also are in some of the lowest zip codes in the city. And then there's a whole group of schools that are kind of in the middle. They don't either can't raise the money, but they also don't get any equity grants. So they just don't have anything. So, director Hollins, I would Chair Hollins, I would pull the question and ask for a vote.

B: Yes. So on the policy specifically there two. Two concerns that I have and I'll state them now because this is the time for board members to talk about their concerns so the policy committee can take them into account. One, the parent committee is undefined. It's un defined both in terms of who will be on it and exactly how it will function. I find that very problematic as they will have the responsibility of any funds that are raised through a district wide foundation in terms of how to distribute them. And the second one, I'm going to be a little bit careful about this. But as a board we have a staff report that is privileged and confidential that explains a significant legal challenge and legal issue with this policy. And so I think that's worthy of a full board conversation that I think we need to do in executive session. I'm not suggesting we do that tonight, but I am suggesting that we schedule an executive session between now and the second reading where the entire board can consider the legal issues that have been raised by the council about this policy. So really quick question. My question is wouldn't that be the role of an ad administrative directive just.

end time: 2763:12:44.000
confidence: 0.88
B: Well, no, just, just. I mean like. Because my understanding is the policy just sets the direction of what right and the how would be an administrative directive.

start time: 2763:13:32.000

end time: 2785:17:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Okay. One of the things that I would say is there's a parent committee. But that language actually was suggested by staff which I incorporated and I just added in that there also be board support. So that director Sullivan had raised concerns in the committee about parents raising money for district wide foundation and not knowing how it would be spent. So based on conversations with staff, they came up with some recommended language which included the parent committee. And I then added the approval by the board. So there would be a sort of board check as part of that. I will say that I don't. I appreciate your raising an issue and I'm not sure I'd agree with your characterization of significant. And I would say that also we're not going to pass a policy that has significant legal challenges.

confidence: 0.96
D: They will be worked out and the issues have been raised that may. They may or may not be issues. So I think we should let the process continue. And if there's an issue, we're also having a meeting with the fund for PTS that if there's an issue, yes, we could have an executive session. But there is not yet an issue. And I don't know that I would characterize it as significant. And I would. Throughout the process. I will say that our general counsel reviewed the drafts and I very much respect having been the policy committee chair for several years that I will listen to the advice and the council of the district's general counsel so that we do things in a way that don't jeopardize the 501c3 nature of whatever the district foundation is.

start time: 2827:55:30.000
end time: 2875:47:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: The next policy is. The next policy that came out of the committee on a split vote is policy 6.2 0.043. And it does two things. One, it changes the name of the policy from Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps to Junior Reserve Office Training Corps and Military Careers. And it adds a paragraph that states it's short. So I'll just read it. In consultation with an approval of the superintendent, a high school principal may establish a Junior Reserve Officer training for a program that aligns with PPS academic standards and policies and administrative directives. This was a policy that Director Green brought to the committee and that we had several committee discussions about. And we also had a request for information from committee members about a number of things. One, about the training for instructors in the Junior ROTC program, questions about the cost. There were also questions about alignment with our policy and administrative directives and our. And our academic standards. There were questions relating to how other school districts in the state or maybe across the country have either incorporated. Have incorporated Junior ROTC in their academic programs. And we had a Chris Frida, who is the cte. I don't know his exact title, but he's the CTE master who had conversations with both districts in Oregon and also in other states that had programs. And he shared how some of the programs worked in other districts and how specifically one, it worked in one Oregon district with the as part of a CTE or career Technical Education strand, and, you know, things that worked and things that were challenges. And so we got a lot of information related to that and we had a good discussion. I also want to note that I think it's important to note that this actually does not say that we can have we have a program or it provides a process by which or how.

start time: 2875:48:10.000
end time: 2875:58:10.000
confidence: 0.94
F: It would be done.

start time: 2875:58:50.000
end time: 2900:16:48.000
confidence: 0.94
D: So the question that we've had is if a high school principal wanted to bring a Junior Reserve Office training program, how would they do it? So this really sets the guardrails for how that would happen. There's a very separate discussion happening in that committee. So I don't know all the details. But in the Student Success Committee with Director Wong around the Standards for Instruction, the Curriculum, the cost. So I assume, like what if there is a program and whether it meets our administrative directives or policy and our academic standards, that that will be answered in the Director Long's committee. Again, this is just answering a question from a school community of if we were to do it like under what circumstances? And so the circumstances are in. The guardrails are. It's with the consultation and approval of the superintendent. And it has to be aligned. Any program has to be aligned with of course our academic standards, well as the administrative directors. And again that came out of committee with a split vote but with a recommendation to move it to a first reading. So tonight's the first reading. Again, we'll have an opportunity for individuals to comment in the committee. Our next committee meeting. And I don't know, Director Wong, if you want to add anything about your committee. I don't know if this is on the agenda moving forward. Okay.

start time: 2900:18:24.000
end time: 2901:49:58.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So I mean it was a while ago, but we haven't talked about it in a while. So there's nothing new to.

start time: 2901:53:04.000
end time: 2916:20:10.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Yeah, Julia, I wanted. I talked to you about. I don't think you added it, but I was wondering if we could add that a survey will be sent to assess the support of the school community before would become. I don't know if you saw my response to your email. My response to the email is I would like you to bring that to the the committee and we can have a discussion about it. I also would like to have assistant superintendent or superintendent or the assistant superintendent for secondary talk about how they add courses because think at high school. In high schools when the electives are added, there's sometimes school surveys. But obviously we're not going to add. We're not going to add a course that no students want to take. But I would suggest you bring that and I'm happy if.

start time: 2916:46:30.000
end time: 2917:06:06.000

end time: 2922:44:10.000
confidence: 0.90
D: You'll come. Okay, perfect. We can have that discussion. I'll notice this is pretend that we like to have somebody talk about how we add courses in what we do and when we survey. This is just a little more controversial than adding a course.

end time: 2936:42:10.000
confidence: 0.94
C: All right, thank you, Directors. The policy proposed to be revised or rescinded will be posted on the board website. And the public comment period is a minimum of 21 days. Please contact. We have contact information for public comments will be posted with the policy. The board expects to hold a second reading of the revised policy which is a vote to approve the mortgage May 7. And also there going to be committee meetings as well for the public to come and express their opinion about the policies on either side. All right. The board will now vote on the consent agenda. Board members, any items you would like to pull for discussion?

F: I just want to also make a note that I'm very much against having ROTC in our schools for lots of reasons. I just want to start with my dad, who's an immigrant from Panama. He came here to finish his high school career at Central Catholic. He was the first negro to graduate from Central Catholic. He went right into the Air Force with a green card and was denied food when he was in basic training. And also the benefits of the GI Bill when he got out of the Air Force. And so that's just a personal story, but also I talked to someone who volunteers with an organization that prepares black children, specifically pps black children, for careers in green jobs. And we were talking about this rotc. And those jobs are going to continue to be in high demand and they're well paying family wage jobs. And unlike the military jobs that prepare you to work in the military but not in the private sector, the ROTC at the college level, I've actually found someone that was advocating for it at the college level because the brain is further developed and if you have a college degree you're entering, you're not going to be in the front line of fire. You're going to be enlisted as an officer and you have greater opportunities starting off. So I just want to put it out there that that's my feeling about it. I might be alone in that, but I feel very strongly that our kids, specifically our kids that don't have opportunities elsewhere, need career technical education that prepares them for jobs that are in high demand, that pay well and that are local, especially as we move to, you know, renewable industries that's relying on renewable industry, renewable energy.

G: I spoke with District Student Council about this and there were a lot of concerns specifically about how the military has A pattern of targeting folks of color or people below the poverty line and creating. Creating a pipeline to the military. Yeah, and just also, there was a lot of concern about a lack of student engagement, and there was, like, expressed desire for that to happen, but many students felt that that did not actually happen. And just overall, the response from district.

start time: 2992:51:50.000
end time: 3012:34:20.000
confidence: 0.93
F: Student council was overwhelmingly negative. I'm going to also ask, what are we? What are we. You know, I asked in the policy committee, what are we solving? What are we trying to solve for? If it's opportunities for people that don't go to college, there's the Blueprint foundation again. It prepares people that might not necessarily go to college for jobs in green energy. I want to prepare our students for jobs where they're not going to get killed or they're not going to come back with PTSD and be unable to work or. You know, my next stop is going to be the VA hospital. I want to talk to people there that can't work, that have mental health challenges, that are. That are wounded, that are unable to be productive members of the community, and that they're sad about it, throwing themselves off bridges over it. And so that's what my concern is, the human piece of this. Let's put. Prepare kids for jobs where they won't be in the line of fire, but rather they can be members, taxpayers, actually.

E: All right, just let me finish. So what we're doing is. And please make sure my mic, the volume is right, because if they're going to get loud, then Herman Green will get louder. We are creating. Well, what. What we're trying to do is create a dog maggot, dogmatic education system, one that does not teach our kids how to think, but rather what to think. We are talking about Providing people with options. Now, JROTC is not for everyone, but it may be for someone and for those people that it is for. We shouldn't be the ones that are standing up to say, you don't need to do that. What we are protecting in this space is our own opinion and our own but bias. We have issues. So because we have an issue, we do not even want to provide the option for someone else to consider. So therefore, what we are saying is, I know better than you, so therefore, you don't need to have this option. Let me make this decision for you, and one day you'll be smart enough to make a decision for yourself. That's the same thing that they said to black people when they were talking about, oh, you don't know how to work for yourself. So. So, yeah, I would go there. So now give kids an option. An educator is supposed to educate. Not about your view, not about your opinion. Because opinions are like underwear. Everybody's got them. Not everybody wears them. Some of them are clean, some of them are dirty, but they are yours nonetheless. I don't care about your opinions. It's opinion. It's an opinion. I want to know about factual data. So now. So now the data, it was. But we're not talking about Vietnam.

F: Angela Juaniga, President of Portland association of Teachers Normally I start with kudos. I'm going to start with gratitudes. I'm grateful for the responsive nature of our interim superintendent, Dr. Husk. I've asked for a meeting to better understand the budget cuts and the mate and the decision decisions that were made to make them. So thank you for that. I'm grateful for our educators, support staff, community who continue to advocate against these cuts and who demand transparency and community input. And as always, I'm grateful for the educators, support staff, custodial nutrition, staff services staff that choose to work here every day despite the working conditions that they have to endure. I'm here to lift up the voices of my members in the community, some of the same voices who came to speak to y'all tonight. PBS contracted with a firm to send out a poll in January 2024 about the Portland teachers Levy, the results of which were released to the Oregonian about a week ago. From that poll we saw PPS families, staff and student, students and community members made it clear only 21% of respondents had a somewhat favorable or very favorable view of this school board, of which 3% said they had a very favorable view of this board. For comparison, PPS teachers came in at 66% with 42% very favorable. PPS support staff came in at 68% with 46% very favorable. PBS principals came in at 44% with 13% very favorable and even PAT came in at 52% with 26% very favorable. 50% of respondents believe PPS is on the quote pretty is quote pretty off on the wrong track, end quote. And only 24% said that we were heading in the right direction. When asked how satisfied are you with the Portland Public School District with how the Portland Public School District spends taxpayer dollars, the net satisfied was 32% with only 6% very satisfied and the net not satisfied was 57% with 33 not satisfied at all. Why am I bringing up this poll? Well, part of the PPS constituent engagement summary from the firm. It was different contract, different firm that heard from 1,823 students, parents and family members, PBS employees and community members mentioned that the top district challenge is about trust. A breakdown in trust was highlighted across all groups. Attention should be paid to repairing and restoring trust with employees, parents and families and community by enhancing transparency, communication and community involvement in school and district decision making. What we are asking for and what we've repeatedly asked for is transparency and meaningful community input PBS has to be surgical with the level of cuts they are making. We lost over 100 educators FTE in the budget presented two years ago and about 70 FTE in the budget presented last year. PBS's pattern of cuts to direct service staff is not something that was caused by a strike. This is a pattern and we cannot continue to cut resources and staff that serve students and expect to meet the goals that y'all have put forth. Regardless of how often Director Scott uses his position on this publicly elected board to disparage the union and thus the teachers who serve this district. We are not the problem. The district's priorities are the problem. We have also seen communications shared with families and communities stating that these cuts will only increase classes by one student on average and that cuts to arts, music, library and dance will not impact student experiences. And these things are just blatantly untrue. The numbers shared with reporters about the cuts per school do not match what educators were presented at their sites. In addition, it undercounts students that are currently at these schools. So how can we how can the district guarantee that classes will only increase by 1 when classes on average, when classes are already above the numbers presented? If an art teacher, for example, is cut from 1.0 FTE to 0.8 FTE, that school's program is reduced by 20%. Losing a library aide whose positions are eliminated across the district, as y'all heard, means that a school cannot open the library for book checkout any day a teacher, librarian or media specialist is not at the school. The current plan to make educators whole includes splitting them across multiple schools. This means libraries across the district will be closed multiple days a week. How will students learn the love of reading and cement that love with their choice books if they can't access their library? We've also learned that more than 50% of our school based restorative justice coordinators who have helped us reduce disproportionate discipline of our black and Brown students have been cut. Conveniently, this happened after they became unit members of pat. You have heard from special educators multiple times, but I would be remiss if I didn't speak up about the cuts to specialized special education services. I encourage the district to reconsider the choices made by the administrators to cut adaptive PE, the feeding team, the assistive tech team, BCBAs and other specialized groups. Not only is it wrong to cut these services, it is illegal as many students have these services written into their IEPs, individualized education plans, IEPs that the directors have tried to demand case managers to review and revise to remove the those supports. Luckily, our special educators know federal law and have refused to revise IEPs based on available programs as the law demands we write their plans based on student needs and team decisions. PBS's own comprehensive annual financial report for the year ending June 30, 2023 shows that in 2023 spending on administration central support services and business support services grew faster than spending on instruction and spending as a whole. The budgeted expenditures for purchase services have increased and the district budgeted more than peer district on purchase services. The comprehensive annual financial report showed that the district approved or amended 60 more contracts in 2023 worth $27 million more than in 2022. We will not, we will no longer uphold unjust school allocations on our backs. Educators will not and cannot make up for the over 160 FTE reductions of our colleagues. As a special educator, Ginger Hussach says in her email signature, I refuse to run myself ragged to uphold a raggedy system. PBS's own poll shows our community does not trust you, does not believe the district is going in the right direction, and does not think this board is a good steward of our public funds. Please prove them wrong by increasing the transparency transparency including meaningful community input and ensuring that any cuts are happening as far away as possible from our students. Thank you.

B: I think it's really important to point out inaccuracies when they occur. And I just want to point out that the idea that we can strategically cut $30 million this year is misinformation and it doesn't help with the conversation publicly. And the idea that we could strategically cut $70 million next year similarly doesn't help because again, it's misleading in terms of what the options actually are on the table. So you can continue to think I'm anti union. What I really am is anti misinformation. And I think I'll be done in a second. Oh yeah, and I think it's just really important. I mean, I guarantee you that our our the trust from the community would be higher if we engaged in responsible populist rhetoric. Part of our job is to actually make decisions that are going to benefit the district in the long run. And I would encourage you to join us in that.

F: I think it's really important to note that I didn't say completely, absolutely undo every single cut. What I showed was a pattern of cuts by this district of educators throughout the last few years, and I asked that those cuts be as far away from students as possible. That was not me saying we can cut 30 million without losing any educators or that you have to. I want to push back on the mischaracterization of my words by you. I think it's also really important, and I'll be done soon too, is that y'all have this position of power. You're on a dais in front of everyone. You have the cameras on you. It's important to steward that power responsibly and not use it as an opportunity to constantly blame the unions for advocating for their workers and say that we're in this position because of what the unions did, fighting for things that they needed in order to their jobs. Well, I've listened to several board meetings at this point where you continue to put Pat's name in your mouth about how we are the problem in a lot of different situations or the fact that we had a strike was a problem. It takes two to tango. We wouldn't be at a strike if we could have gotten to a contract during the months that we were bargaining, that we demanded proposals and y'all were lied to and told you couldn't give us proposals on permissive subjects. Chair Hollins. So I'm just going to say that is all.
