A: All right. Good evening. Good evening. This public regular meeting of Board of education for June 11, 2024 is called to order. All items being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the board and meeting tabs. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV service website and on channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. All right. Good evening. Welcome, everyone. I want to thank everyone for being here this evening. Before we get started, I want to share a few housekeeping reminders. I see we're going to have a large crowd and an invested crowd this evening. So in order to ensure safety, please keep walkways and aisles clear. We also ask that you please be considerate to those around you and keep any signs below chin level. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that our primary objective is to engage in the business and service of our children. We want everyone to be examples of being respectful and courteous to each other, including us as board members, even though. Even when we disagree. I want to be very clear this evening, if we cannot conduct business in this room, what this means is if we hear audience members yelling at the board or board members, if we hear chants or anything that disrupts us from doing our work on behalf of our kids, I will give one warning. On the second disruption, we will move our meeting to another location, broadcast a meeting from that location, and that you, the public, will not get to participate. That means we will have no public comments or statements. This action will affect those who came here with good intentions of participating in this public forum. Before we get started, I wanted to say a few words. I'll just make sure that's clear. All right, so now I want to say a few words. Last week, the board unanimously approved the appointment of Dr. Kimberly Armstrong as the next superintendent of Public parking school. Is Dr. Armstrong in the building? I saw her. There she is. She's in the back. So we'll say welcome back. As she was here before. We believe you are the right person at this time to lead PPS to the next level of our kids. I also want to take this opportunity to publicly thank Dr. Huss for her leadership the last several months. Stepping in mid year is not an easy task. Dealing with board members like us was not an easy task. But your experience has helped us get through the school year. So I want to make sure I thank you for joining the PPS team. And I know our colleagues would like to say a few words as well. All right. I don't know. Since I don't know if we're just going any random order. I just want to jump in. I got the mic now, so I just want to take this moment to say thank you for your willingness to come in. Thank you for accepting the challenge. Thank you for blazing forward. Thank you for being up front, being vocal, not being afraid to share where you feel like we need to go amongst, you know, just like, hey, but what about this? No, this is. This is good. And then being able to explain the why, the rationale behind the why, and just being very upfront and forthcoming. So I just wanted to take this moment as just me to personally say thank you. Thank you for what you put into.

B: This, thank you for your service and thank you for caring about our community. I really appreciate having worked with you these few months. I've learned a lot from you just, just by your presence. Really appreciate your steadfastness, your knowledge of this organization and just your willingness to come in at a crucial time in the middle of the year with budget cuts in front of us and the hard work of, as Chair Holland said, working with us. And it's just been a pleasure. Yes. You're just always there. Every time I would call you call right back. And always had words that would help me with whatever I was dealing with. And everybody's already said it, but just really appreciate you. Thank you. Sandy, I've known you for a long time, and I want to tell you how much I appreciate you answering the call last winter when you knew what I was calling about, because it would have been very easy for you not to answer the phone. You know, anytime you have an interim, often it can be a time in which things stall out and people agree we're just going to wait for the next leader to come to lead things. And I love the spirit that you brought with it, which was that you took the baton from Guadalupe and continue to move things forward and not only in a sort of placeholder way, but really looked at what we were trying to achieve with our budget and for our students, even during a difficult budget year that, you know, we were trying to keep our eye on the board goals and what we wanted for our students. And you didn't miss a beat. You came right in. We're super lucky to have an experienced superintendent because I think it would be very challenging for most people to come into a district that's already midstream with a lots of things happening. And as we all know, there's a metaphorical fire in PPS every day. And not only did you deal with Those, but you also kept the work going for our students. It was really important after the start of the school year when we had, you know, the start of the year with students out of school because of the strike, and it was important for PPS and for our superintendent recruitment that we had a strong end to the school year because you've really left. Are going to be leading things in a way that our next superintendent is going to have a district that's well positioned to have a strong opening next fall for our kids to have a great experience. So I really appreciate your willingness to give up your spring because I know you could have done many other things. So thank you so much from PBS and also on behalf of our students. Yeah, it's okay if I go. I don't want to go last. Everyone's kind of said a lot of.

I think one of the things that's understated a lot is someone who has been in quite a few districts, had led a few other districts, is that you bring a wonderful perspective and fresh new ideas. And I can always tell that you are an educator because I've learned so much from you and really enjoyed your time here. I think you're calm, you're a little bit crazy, but you also exude a very wonderful, calm presence. And because of that, I never panicked.

B: So thank you. I think just from the very first moment you called me, I could tell how personally invested you are. And I think that shines through in all of the actions you take. You really are so caring, and that has really translated to your emphasis on communication. I've heard wonderful things from the community about that. Just like the thoughtful responses to emails and the way you really take the time out of your day to make sure that everyone knows they're valued, whether they're on the board or sitting in the community. And I think you are just the best example of a leader I could think of. Really. You exemplify all of the qualities I always look for in leaders. So thank you so much for your service. Well, high praise. Thank you all very much. And some of You I've just met recently and I hope will stay in your life as friends and colleagues for a long, long time. And Julia and I have known each other a long time. I was hoping my husband would not figure out how to stream these meetings, but he has figured it out. So I do want. Julia knows him as well. Well, actually, it was Charles who guessed. As soon as I saw your number, I went in and he said, you know what she wants. He said, call her back. And then he said, and you know how to do it, and they really need you. And so that was all the permission I needed. And this district is really worth it. An amazing team, fantastic student body, caring adults, elected leaders all over the place. And I know it's been a tough year and it's been a year with a lot of obstacles, but I like to focus on the gifts and the positiveness you're inheriting or adopting, I should say a fantastic leader who knows this community, who really loves PPs. You're going to be in great hands. So thank you for the compliments. It's been very rewarding and I'm very happy that I did it. Not crazy, maybe just a little overly energetic.

And I'm thankful for this opportunity to be here this evening to celebrate the wins of our students. This Season. I want to acknowledge our coaches and our students for their dedication and their commitment this season. We oftentimes look at or we see the finished product or the results the season. But I know for our coaches and our students, the work to have the success that they had this spring took place well before that day in mid February when the season officially began. So I just want to acknowledge their commitment and their dedication to their sport. Also would like to thank the families, building staff, community members who came out to support our students and coaches along the way, many of whom traveled down to Eugene a few weeks ago to support our students and have attended the various state competitions this spring. This spring, as I mentioned, we had a number of wins or huge accomplishments. We had 22 top three finishes in track and field, individual finishes in track and field, and we also had two top three relay finishes in track and field. We also celebrate our individual state champion in tennis. But tonight I want to acknowledge the students that are here tonight and celebrate their accomplishments. So, students, as I call your name, if you can come forward. Peter Bradbury from Roosevelt, third place finish, 400 meters. So Diablo. Genevieve Thabeau, Jefferson High School. Third place finish in the 100 meters. So what we can do, because I think we have a lot of kids and I don't know if they're going to all be able to stay them. Yeah, can you just have them go back to their seat and then when he gets done with all of them, we have all of them come up. So that's what they'll be have to stand on all the time. And I want to make sure he. I want to make sure he speaks to Malia Canada. Elliott from McDaniel High School. First place in the triple jump and first place in the long jump.

B: Thank you. Can you hear me? Okay. Great, great, great. Thank you. Chair Hollins, members of the board, Interim Superintendent Husk. It's a pleasure to be here tonight. My name is Kristin Brayson, Director of Visual Performing Arts. And tonight I have the distinct pleasure of acknowledging our district's high school music education programs. As many of you know, our school's music ensembles and soloists recently competed in the OSAA state competition. I'm thrilled to announce that they have emerged as victorious state champions and top tiered finalists. This is an extraordinary achievement that deserves to be celebrated. It's a testament not only to the talent and hard work of our students, but also to the dedication and expertise of the district music program directors that are joining us tonight. We know that such success does not come easily. It requires countless hours of rehearsals, unwavering commitment, and a passion for excellence. Our award winning music programs have demonstrated all of these qualities and more. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the members of the ensembles and the soloists who have brought so much pride to our district. Love to join. I'd love to Encourage these folks to join me up here. There's 22 of them. Count them, 22 awards we won. So we're going to start with the directors standing up and waving. And directors, if you don't have students here today, if you could come up and grab their certificates, that would be great. So first, I'd love to recognize director Jeremy Dell. The band program at McDaniel High School. And in the tuba category, we have Beckham Weatherby that won the state championship For Franklin high School, we have the choral director Katie Simmons. And the mixed vocal ensemble won the state championship. Their name is Freya and Paul duet. Allison Cottrell is the choral director at Cleveland high school. And she had a third place mezzo voice student Olivia Carson placed third place. Alison again, her small treble vocal ensemble. Third place was the Cleveland treble duet. And then finally as a state champion is is tonight Nago Ramirez at the mezzo voice. And that was Alison Cottrell, too, as director Gary Ryler, who's the director of bands at Cleveland high school. His large percussion ensemble named Tweety Fleety birds plays third place. Also for Gary, the trombone. In the category of trombone, Tie Friel place third place. In the category of small brass ensemble, third place went to the middle part trio. In the large woodwind ensemble, second place went to double reed ruckus. And then finally, and this is really great honor, in the state band championship, director Reiller and his group, the Cleveland wind ensemble place third. Director of choral program at Grant high school, John Eisman couldn't be with us tonight, but his large treble vocal ensemble named nothing but treble placed third. And in the category of bass voice, second place went to Declan Bellotti. In the category of large treble bass vocal ensemble, the state champion was hooked on harmonics from Grant. And in the small tenor bass vocal ensemble, the average johns won state champions for the band program at Grant. We have director Chris McCurdy here. And in the category of clarinet soloist, third place went to Sasha Drewes. Also for Grant, the oboe category, soloist Eleanor Price, third place. And then for Grant, in the category of jazz combo, second place went to the all female jazz changes pdx. I missed somebody. Oh, thank you. I did miss. Let me go back. I'm sorry, to Cleveland. There's two I missed. Thank you. The category of small percussion ensemble state champions went to the librarians. And for the low clarinet soloist Cooper Hendrick won state champion. Now, the last three are really important, too, in a big way. If you are from Portland or if you've been Here a while, you know that we have a huge jazz scene, and I feel like we as PPS feed that jazz scene because we swept the competition. So in third place was, under the direction of Jason Margolis, was the Roosevelt Jazz Ensemble. In second place, under the direction of Gary Reiller, was the Cleveland Jazz ensemble. And in first place, under the direction of Chris McCurdy, was the Grant Jazz Ensemble. It is worth noting that last year, first place went to Roosevelt, second place went to Grant, and third place went to Cleveland. So these directors are in a heavy competition each year, but it goes to show that we have a strong presence. So I wanted to finish out by just letting the musicians in the room know. Your OSA season is from fall to spring. It is a season that was nothing short of spectacular, and it has set a new standard for what can be achieved in the arts in Portland public schools. You have not only won a championship or placed in the top three.

B: But you've also inspired your peers and the entire community to come together to achieve greatness. This part's important. PPS will have 88 school music programs this fall, showing an increase of 92% since 2015, with the majority of programs being added since 2020. Achievements like this are a direct result of the value our district places on arts education and underscores the importance the arts have in our students lives throughout their K12 trajectory. None of this growth would have been possible without our outstanding educators, including our elementary and middle school music educators, who fostered a strong pathway of music courses for students to thrive. Huge thanks should be given to the directors, the families, and the school sites themselves for ensuring the success as well as the perseverance and dedication of our beloved central office music tosa, Laura Arthur, who spent five years cultivating high quality music education in pps. Thank you so much. So congratulations, everybody. You've brought an honor, a great honor to our district, and we look forward to many more outstanding performances in the future.

All right, last but not least, we want to recognize this year OSAA state champions for policy debate, our own student director, Frankie Silverstein and her teammate, Luke. Yeah, they won this year OSAA championship and policy debate, never losing a round in the entire Competition. This is nothing new for this team. They won six out of eight tournaments they competed this year, sometimes debating teams that had two years or more experience in debate. The team will also represent Northern Oregon at the National Speech and Debate Championship in June, the first time that Franklin or the Portland Urban Debate League has qualified a team for this tournament.

A: Good evening, Chair Hollins, Vice Chair Green, Board Directors and Student Director Silverstein. I'm here before you tonight with a resolution honoring June as Pride Month in PPS for your consideration. Pride Month is an opportunity for us to reflect on the societal accomplishments of LGBTQ Americans and the diversity that spans the range of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and more. Pride is a month of inclusivity where we recognize all colors of the rainbow. Pride Month is a time for LGBTQ Americans to stand and shout, we're here. Pride Month is a time of celebration and acknowledgement, is a reminder to LBGTQ students, staff and community members that they are seen, that they are valued, and that they are accepted exactly as they are. You may have noticed that I wear a Pride flag on my suit lapels every day. If I have on a jacket, I wear my rainbow. It's a signal not only that I'm gay, but that other LGBTQ members of the community, staff and student body are safe with me and they are seen by me. I wear this flag with Pride. But it wasn't always this way. I worked in places where I did not feel safe to be out to be my full, authentic self. Growing up, I was bullied and harassed because I was viewed as different. Believe it or not, for most of my life, including when I came out in my early 30s, I was skinny, very skinny. But once I realized I was gay, I wanted to change that. I needed to change that, because I didn't feel safe in my skinny body. I had been beaten and bullied, and I was determined that I wouldn't be beaten or bullied for being gay. So I started eating everything within sight and lifting weights five or six days a week, all in order to build a body that would signal to people, you don't mess with that dude. All because I didn't feel safe. Why am I sharing this personal anecdote? Because each year I look at our data, and our data are upsetting. Each year on the Youth Behavior Risk Survey, our secondary LGBTQ students tell us they don't feel safe and that they're bullied. On our. On our successful school survey, the data are the same. Our LGBTQ + students rate their feeling of safety as 10 percentage points lower than their straight peers. And that's not okay. In fact, it's unacceptable. All students and staff should feel safe and valued within our buildings and greater community. Affirming June as Pride Month as a reminder that they can be who they are without fear. Especially during this month, but hopefully always. It is a reminder that we must pause, recognize and uplift our LGBTQ students, staff and community members. Those of us with power must use that power for good by supporting and affirming others who are in the minority so that they feel less alone and less afraid. A quote I recently saw said quote, encouraging someone to be entirely who they are is the loudest way to love on them. So let's love out loud and love on our LGBTQ + students, staff, and community members. So thank you, board Directors, for your consideration. Thank you for standing in solidarity and solidarity with and in support of LGBTQ + students, staff, and community members. Thank you from all of us. Happy Pride Month. Thank you. Thank you. Do I have a motion and second. To adopt Resolution 6926? Motion.

B: I want to thank you, Dr. Adams, for showing up as your authentic self and sharing your story. Because I know our students are looking for representation and to see a leader in the district speaking up and speaking out is really important. So thank you all. I think this is. I don't know how many years in a row, but I really appreciate it. And for every day showing up who you are. Director Abraham Edwards said what I wanted to say as well, but I just want to appreciate you, for all of you, your skinny self, your bigger self, and your gay self. And I really see you and appreciate you, not just today and this month, but every day, and also want to appreciate you for bringing forth that data about the climate survey, because we hear that every year that our gay and transgender students feel. Don't feel safe at school. And that's something that's really important to me. So thank you for modeling, great leadership and great gay ship. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, everyone just kind of said what I want to say, too, and reiterate the safety of schools. It's so important.

And I really appreciate everything that you said tonight. Thank you.

B: Yes, we have Madeline Mendiola. Hi, can you hear me? My name is Madeline Mendiola. Do you need me to spell it? M A, D, E, L, I, N E. M E, N, D, I, O, L, A. I've been a teacher within PBS over the last five years. Currently, I teach a class on race and social justice as well as gender studies at McDaniel High School that's being cut because of your proposed budget cuts. Has my time started first? Yes. Recognize June is Pride Month. It's 2024. However, don't be surprised if our community doesn't applaud your obvious pink washing during a genocide. More importantly, you know what I'm thinking about this Pride? As a queer educator, I'm thinking about all of the innocent queer Palestinians whose remains are still under the rubble and how their families may only be able to identify them by a pair of car keys or a ring on their severed finger. The other day, I Saw a Palestinian man holding his baby's charred, decapitated body. I'm thinking about how that baby will never grow up to discover their sexuality. I'm thinking about the queer PPS high school student who can't afford college, so they fall victim to the predatory grooming of military recruitment programs in our schools like jrotc. Maybe that high school student will end up standing side by side with an IOF soldier, slaughtering 300 innocent people, just as US soldiers did only three days ago in the Nusrat refugee camp. They disguised themselves in a humanitarian aid truck and waited for starving people to gather. Does that not make you sick? I will not give you a history lesson on the Israeli settler colonial project. A simple Google search, which I'm sure you all are capable of, proves through historical fact that what the Palestinians have experienced for the last 100 years is ethnic cleansing, apartheid and genocide. And to pretend it's not is delusional. To date, more than 15,000 children and over 36,000 Palestinians total have been slaughtered. Palestinian children have such severe ptsd, there are instances of children dying from heart attacks. The images I've seen and the screams of Palestinians will haunt me for the rest of my life. Our students are seeing the same exact horrors on their screens and see your silence for what it is. Cowardice and corruption. During my time at PPS, I have had class sizes of 40. I have had rats and water damage and broken heaters. I've watched the school to prison pipeline fully functioning in our historically black schools. I've witnessed students bleed and sob and fight and bully and use hateful language because we didn't have the resources to help them navigate trauma. And this is all to say that I've witnessed an inconceivable amount of preventable violence within PPS schools. Violence you all could have prevented. Excuse me, if only you had actually staffed our schools properly and lowered class sizes instead of spending our budget on a bloated communications department. An awful inequitable curriculum that kids hate. How much did you spend that again? 20 million 30 seconds. Side note, I find it really interesting that you refuse the clause in a proposed contract requiring district officials to disclose a personal or financial conflict of interest with contractors. Now, at the end of my time in pps, I have witnessed the district and the board at its lowest cowering in the face of taking a stance during a genocide because it might not be lucrative. My anger sits in my chest like a rock for the suffering of the Palestinians that you and so many others have chosen to ignore for the suffering of my students, for the suffering of my colleagues, and for my own suffering. I know that beneath that anger is a deep well of grief. And I'm going to be grieving for a very long time.

A: Yes. All opposed? Hearing none. Resolution 6926 is approved by a vote of 70 with Student Director Silverstein voting yes. Yes. All right. All right. Next we have on our agenda. In May of 2021, the board adopted a process by which board members could be considered for board leadership positions. The resolution states that in order to be considered for a leadership position, board must notify the board manager in writing by June 1st if they plan to run for board leadership in in the July election. Then at that first board meeting in June, which is tonight, the board chair will publicly confirm board members who are interested in serving leadership. Both Director Green and Director Wong has submitted to Ms. Powell their desire to be considered for board chair. And Director Brim Edwards and the past have indicated they would like to be considered for board vice chair. The board will vote on board leadership at the July 9 board meeting, the first board meeting of the school year. Do any of the candidates want to say any words? All right, moving on. Superintendent. Dr. Huss, would you like to give your report?

start time: 786:35:50.000
end time: 837:00:42.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Yes, I would. Thank you. So I think most of you know that this will officially be my last time at the board. Dr. Armstrong has generously offered to come to next Tuesday and the following Tuesday's meeting. I've shared that with board leadership. And so I will be working in the district. I'll be supporting her and working on transition with her. But I wanted to use this opportunity just to say a few things about my work in respect with the board. And I think we all come into these positions for the same reason we run for election. We go through degrees to become teachers and principals and other kinds of educators, superintendents. Because we want our students to grow, to thrive, to be creative, to be purposeful thinkers and doers after they spend time in school. We want them to have options. And it's why you run to be on the school board. And I know it's a real challenge to serve On a school board. It's a volunteer position. It requires a lot of hours. It requires looking at a lot of materials and a lot of complex situations, especially in a district of this size. And so it can be a challenge to stay focused on the bigger picture. It can be easy to get distracted by the day to day swirl of a big and a vibrant district. So even when we are focused on politics and outside pressures and by events that we have no control over my measure, my message is simple. Let's stay united in our desire for our students to succeed and excel. We must remain united. The kids, as Chair Hollins always says, the kids are too important. PPS has detailed plans that define what student achievement will look like. They have an instructional framework. We're looking at an effective schools framework. So please, please help the staff stay focused on that work. I have a set of observations and recommendations that I'll pass to you and share with board secretary, et cetera. But in here are some recommendations I have for you to examine your own work in governance now and as you go forward. And I've talked with Dr. Armstrong about this and I know she feels the same and I know you'll agree as well. So I use John Carver's policy governance model to frame my comments in here. It's not the only model out there, but the reason I chose it. I think it's a really good one for thinking about role clarity. What is the board responsible for? What are you holding the superintendent responsible for? And then how is she holding her staff accountable? Role, clarity, clear communications. Stay focused on the big picture and then measure for accountability and for support. The reason we want accountability systems is so people can learn from each other, students and adults alike. So I'll leave this with you this evening. If you have any questions in the next two and a half weeks, I'm happy to talk with you about it. And if you have any questions three or four or five years from now, you know how to find me. I won't be far away. I'll be in Oregon, just in a different location. So again, thank you so much.

B: Through PBS since first grade, and so I've actually gotten to witness that progress. And I really do think things have changed. Just the comfortability about talking about LGBTQ issues has really increased. I remember in elementary school, and a lot of it kind of felt like it was on the students, you know, proposing this to the teacher. Can we talk about this today? Whereas now I really see that in most curriculums, especially, like, in our health classes. But that being said, you know, it's.

B: Are taking that initiative. I also want to acknowledge that we always have more work to do, especially on the student side of things. I do feel like student voices are valued, but still, we need more space for them. They need to be more actively engaged. And I know that's always a frustration and always a focus. And that's why I have full confidence that things are going to change. Because even though there is disagreement in our district, I actually think that's really, really healthy and what we should have, because I also know at the core of that, everyone is just fighting for what they think is right for students, but also, at the same time, students know what's best for students. So I really do look forward to the day when education is not an afterthought or a talking point, but valued as the cornerstone of our society that it is.

I really appreciate you. I am grateful of you being on our board. When I think that, you know, with the last student directors, I like, can't get no better than this. Can't get no better than this. And then, bam, here comes Frankie, right? And it gets better. I love your. Your. Your wisdom, I love your voice, and I love that you have been unapologetically using that voice regardless of what all of us folks up here say. Right. That has been such a guiding light for me, listening to your voice, your voice representing the students and your constant advocacy for student voice at the table. And that's something that I will take with me along whatever long journey this is going to be. So I just want to say thank you. I look forward to seeing everything you're going to be doing in the next year that you have here and beyond. So, from bottom of my heart, thank you so much for your presence, your being. Thank you.

B: Well, I've had the privilege of sitting right next to Frankie all year long and to see her creativity. I even get to see what she's done on her for her report and then what she can even do just out of her head. She's just brilliant. And I said to her soon after the strike, oh, I'll bet you wish you weren't student rep this year. This is really a rough one. She said, no, no, because now I'll really learn more and so that's the kind of person Frankie is. And I'll miss you. But I think you're probably right about jj. I've met him, too. So, anyway, thank you, Frankie. It's really been a privilege. Also, want to weigh in. I'm lucky I haven't sat next to you, but at the same end of the horseshoe as you this year. But I also want to speak to you. I feel lucky that I had you on the policy Committee. And, you know, we have some. Sometimes some mundane issues at the policy committee, administrative things, and then we have some big, hot topics. And what I really appreciated is that you didn't hold back. You weighed in, you held your ground. I thought you showed that you're the debate champ that you are. I was very appreciative that. I don't think it was often on the other side of you because you. I say you took a stand. I think you did a good job not only representing your views and experiences as a student, but you brought so many other student perspectives to the table and encouraged other students to weigh in, even if they had different opinions than you. So that we really got the sort of. The more the mosaic of different student voices, not just yours. And that takes a special talent. And we're super lucky that you're a junior, so we don't have to say goodbye, because usually I've said goodbye to 11 student reps over the years, and this is not goodbye. And I'm really looking forward to your continued engagement because I know that you'll still active this next year, and I can't wait to see what next year brings. So thank you so much for your service. I appreciate your openness.

You're not here to be liked. You're here to change lives. And so keep doing what you're doing. It's working.

I feel a little removed just physically have learned from the way you advocate. You're also a quiet leader. I consider myself a quiet leader as well and have just appreciated that you do listen and you are still very steadfast in your values. That's the best way to win up here and to win at life and is to really listen, to learn. I've appreciated that about you. I've appreciated the policy committee work and just the way you show up. So thank you. And yeah, you're not going anywhere. So hopefully we will stay in touch next year. I don't want to go last, but I guess I am.

It informs and improves our work and we look forward to hearing your thoughts and reflections. Our board office may follow up on board related issues raised during public testimony. We request that complaints about individual employees be directed to the Superintendent's office as a personnel matter. For materials you would like the board to receive handouts, pictures, et cetera, please do not come to the Dyess. Please hand them to our board manager, Ms. Bradshaw. Oh, raise your hand and she would distribute them to us. If you have additional materials, items you would like to provide to the board or the superintendent, we ask that you email them to public comment all one word@pps.net public commentsps.net please make sure when you begin your comments that you clearly state your name and spell your last name as the time will start. Then you will have three minutes to speak. You will hear the sound after three minutes, which means you will have 30 seconds to wrap up your comments. After that, then we go to the next person.

Unfortunately, two schools in Portland Public Schools District have tested positive. Which leaves our school Harrison park, the only the only school that was negative. Those two schools were Cesar Chavez and Oakley Green. Just because Harrison park tested negative doesn't mean we shouldn't show up and fight for other schools.

And yet we are faced instead with military recruitment shrinking staff overwhelming class sizes and private contracts taking the place of genuine educators and building personnel.

But when these staff are lost from our schools where myself and many other students, thousands of us, need these staff and rely on them to have a good education and to be able to grow up and thrive, that is a travesty. Another place that PBS has shown woeful ignorance and ineptitude is in acknowledging the loss of thousands of other students lives and thousands. On top of that in Palestine, where PPS has remained silent through months and months of genocide. This is unacceptable. Words are not difficult to create.

B: Just the adoption. Yes, that would be the adoption. I'm going to say just a couple things. First, I want to thank the superintendent for coming in mid year with a challenging hand that required, I think, what we normally wouldn't ask an interim superintendent to do so appreciation. And also, Myung, for coming back. Your team did a great job continuing on during the time that you were gone and we appreciate you coming back. I just want to briefly say that this budget should be a call to action to our school community and to the legislature and community leaders who support public schools. We've had. Last fall we said that our costs were going to exceed what we get, the funding we get from our state and that we were going to have to make cuts this year and next year. And I believe this community knows that our public schools are the foundation of our community. We have so many great things happening at our schools. I'm glad we started tonight's meeting with our recognition of our students because it is really, it demonstrated the amazing things that happen in our schools every day. And I'll just take, for example, the music students. It wasn't just their high school band directors that impacted them, but their elementary and middle school music teachers. You know, we have art, music, pe, dual language program, college prep classes, career and technical education students. We have competitive middle school sports program, relatively low class sizes, and we have a great public school system. And it shouldn't be dismantled because of state funding not keeping up with the cost to actually provide that education. In addition, we have, we know that we have work to do because it's not, not all of our students are benefiting from the education programs in our, in our schools. So in order to both maintain our programs and to accelerate students who deserve better from the school district, we need adequate funding for the state. And I know that this board and our incoming superintendent are going to be focused on communicating to the legislature and the governor the need for better funding. So I want to put a fine point on. We're expecting our elected leaders, many of them who sent their kids to public school, to public schools and benefited from the things in Portland public schools that we expect them to step up and lead for us in Salem. And we're going to be right there with lots of parents and others advocating for it. I want to. There's one. I want to acknowledge that the staff attempted to, as much as possible, make the cuts that had to happen as far away from the classroom as possible, which meant that there were district level cuts that will impact the level of services and also that this budget does contain cuts that our schools and our students will feel. And that's really unfortunate. But again, I think this is a call to action to our community that we need to change the, the debate and the outcomes that we're getting from Salem.

A: Thank you. See, Director Scott has his hand up. Thanks, Chair Hollins. Yeah, I think, I think it's worth just giving, you know, a little bit in terms of the context of why we're here. And I won't repeat earlier comments I've made about state funding. I think Director Bedworth talked about some of that. I'll touch on it briefly. But you know, I, I'm going to vote for this budget tonight. I think it tries to achieve the balance that we're trying to achieve when we're looking at cuts that we're looking at. And I think it's just worth reminding, you know, folks that, you know, the reason why we're cutting $30 million from this budget is twofold. And it one, it's because we've made really important investments in our staff and we've invested more in pay for our teachers, more in pay for other staff. It is not as much as those employees wanted, nor is it as much as the board. Board wanted to give. I would have loved to have given much more in terms of pay. What we also gave was also more than we could afford. And, and we talked about that at the time. And, and that's what we're talking about now with this cut budget and simultaneously the state, you know, has failed to fund us adequately. And you know, if the state was funding this adequately at the qem, we'd be able to actually provide not just the raises and, and employee investments that we've made, we'd be able to provide even more. But you know, because of that state funding level, we are where we are. Like I said, I won't repeat, I've made some extensive comments and op EDS around state funding. I wish I could say I'm optimistic about it. I'm not. I'm actually very pessimistic about it. And the reason is because the political incentives in this state are not aligned to put pressure on our state officials to increase funding for education. I'm hopeful that some of the newly motivated and active activated parents from, I think from this year are going to be able to put a little bit more pressure on. But I haven't seen the type of movement I'd like to see from the governor of the legislature that shows they actually take this problem seriously. So it's going to be a long effort to get there. With all that said, I do think we've done the best we can with a budget that needs to cut nearly $30 million to find that balance. I continue to have concerns about the cuts we're making in administrative services. And the reason for that is because, and I've said this before, I think this dichotomy between classroom and non classroom expenses is false. Every dollar this district spends should be in service of increasing student achievement for our kids. And if it's not in service of that, we should cut it. And if those cuts are on the administrative side, then I am all in favor of cutting them. But I also note that any organization of our size needs administrators to actually function and function well. And even tonight when people talk about different things, we hear in testimony so much of what these, what the public and our constituents are asking for is actually on the administrative side of the budget. We're slashing that. We're slashing that significantly and I think people are going to see that impact. We're also slashing teachers, we're also slashing other staff in this district. And I think as director said that that is going to have an impact as well. So I think it's a good budget, or maybe I should say as good a budget as we can do, which is why I'm going to support it. I do want to end with one comment and it still troubles me quite a bit because we talked about cutting $30 million this year. We're not cutting $30 million because the board at our last meeting chose to add the $1.8 million back for our RESJ partners and they chose to add that back without any offset. And I think it's just worth really calling out that money is coming out of our reserves and it is taking us below our board policy of 5%. And what makes that really frustrating to me is not the investment I said at the time and I'll say it today, I think it's quite possible that that is where we should be investing additional dollars. Maybe that dollars is the best way to increase student achievement. But because we didn't engage with the district and district staff and the superintendent on the best way to do that and instead we stepped in in a last minute amendment to cut, you know, to add that $1.8 million without an offset. We, we, we've really taken this budget out of balance again. And I just want to point out we didn't do that when teachers were complaining about increased class sizes. We didn't do that when parents and community was talking about sped spending. We didn't do that around some of the key admin staff positions. And we didn't do that because we were trying to send as a board a signal that we this budget and we need to make some hard decisions. And I think that last minute amendment which has now been not offset, it simply punts $1.8 million into the 2526 school year. So we already have a very difficult budget that that amendment made worse. I'm still going to support the overall budget as you know, as it stands. But I'm very frustrated by that and I think the board should really think about how we approach these issues moving forward. Thanks, Free Comics. Any other board comments?

B: Yeah, okay. I mean I think realistically like when we have to make decisions like this, people are not going to be happy. But I think it's also really saddening to hear that it's not just frustration or disagreement, it's hurt. And I'm really hoping that in future budget processes, you know, even if people like not all the feedback that is given is actually implemented, that people do at least feel like they've been listened to. Because even if there have been opportunities to provide feedback if people aren't aware of them or if people don't feel like they're enough, that is a very real problem that also feels very real to the community. So I'm really looking forward to seeing what next year, even though I won't be sitting up here, what that looks like. Yeah, I'm going to vote for this budget, too. I am, as I've told people, not very happy with the 1.8 million either. But I also think this budget has to be passed and I think we really did try to make it as fair as we could. And fair isn't always enough, but I think that's what we've got and just hope we get some money. I know Andrew is very pessimistic about getting more from the state. I'm going to try to keep a positive mind about that and do all I can to go down there and talk to people. And if anybody out there knows people in the legislature, work on them. If you can go down, do it. But I think we need everybody doing it. So I'm just hopeful and this is my first year and I've heard we did this budget because of so many things, didn't have enough time for it. So I hope next year we do take the whole year, do it as best we can, hopefully get more money. But we've got to live with what we've got this time and nobody's happy. But I can honestly say I think we've done the best we can. Thank you.

A: Any other board comments? Okay, so I'm gonna make a comment. I always, you know, since I've been on the board, I've always voted no for the budget only because that's my way of protesting the state not funding us at adequate level. So that's the reason why I'm going to vote no on the budget. Otherwise I. The budget itself is fine. I do have some issues with some of the comments. You know, when we tout resj, which is our racial equity and social justice, and we put that out there on Front street. And then when we look at funding those things, whether they had cuts or not cuts is really disheartening. If anyone has actually, and I'm not 100% sure, I don't know how many people here on this board have actually spent time at SEI or Latino Network to really say if that's somewhere. And when you compare teachers and libraries and all that stuff, if folks have actually spent time in these organizations, we're not just talking about dollars, we're actually talking about lives. And if you understood that, because these organizations actually save lives, not just a dollar amount. It ain't just 1.8 million. How much do you put a dollar amount on somebody's life? I've seen these organizations actually save people lives. And if you haven't engaged with these organizations, if you haven't talked to these organizations. If you haven't been to these organizations, it's really disheartening that you criticize a decision now. Maybe the process wasn't right. I thought, you know, when you have a budget committee, that's the time to make amendments. And the things I got the information in the fashion that I got it, which didn't need time to have staff engagement and talk with staff and made me sure I'm being absolutely transparent. Heel. That was not a strategic plan for me to add to add that amendment to this, to that, to the amendment at the last meeting. That was me seeing the realization of our so called RESJ priorities and making sure that those RESJ priorities are holding true to what we say we're going to do. And once again, if nobody up here knew I was going to do that, I didn't even know I was going to do that. I thought about it. I didn't know if I actually was going to do that. But when we sit here and talk about, you know, teachers and librarians, I'll be honest, when I see kids who are literally getting saved, their lives getting saved, I'm not worrying about a library book. You know, I'm not worried about some of those things that we talk about when we actually talk about actual lives. I don't know how many kids and children's funerals you guys have been to. I've been to enough where it's sickening to where I see kids getting shot. And when you have organizations that stopping that, there is no dollar amount that you can put on that, regardless of if we have teachers. And another thing I want to say is that every single one of us here on the board have the obligation and a right if they feel something else is a priority to speak up for it. But don't, don't come at, don't come after someone for speaking up something for what they believed in. And so everybody has the obligation or the right to speak up for something that they, they believe in. Dr. Director Scott sir Holmes. I respect that, except my issue and I want to repeat it again because I said it. But I want to be really clear. It's not with where we spent the money, it's how we did it. Because I want to be clear, you did not amend the budget to spend $1.8 million more on CBO. You just, on the CBOs, you just kicked that can to 25, 26. So if we as a board wanted to spend more and there's a majority to spend that, and honestly, I would have probably supported that. But we needed to make the cuts, and we didn't. We didn't go to the community and honestly say what you just said was these programs, in your opinion, and maybe the board's opinion, are more important than teachers, administrators, you know, sped programs, other things. But we didn't make that decision. All we did was we took money out of our reserves. We were at a dangerously low level. And we said to the next year's budget and the next year's board, you guys are going to have to find this $1.8 million because we weren't brave enough to do it. That's my issue. It's not that you have been. It's not that you asked to spend more on CBOs. It's that we didn't do it in a way that actually. That actually amended the budget to make those. Those necessary cuts. May I.

And I also want to read from an excerpt from a celebratory day, the day that chair Hollins and director Green were sworn in, and it was Director Brent Edwards gave me a prompt to talk about Albina and this day and this place. And I'm going to read an excerpt from that history piece because it's important to our. Germane to our conversation today. So for over 70 years, 170 years, PPS has had a failing pattern of response towards the struggles of communities of color, especially black and Native American, stems from institutional and cultural racism that continues to exacerbate the inequities we see in society. And in fact, the origin story of Portland Public Schools is one of a district that viewed black and native children as burdens to educate.

B: Exclusion by PPS occurred when William Brown, a resident of Portland in 1860, tried to enroll his children in one of Portland's only two public elementary schools, launching what would be the first and only case of official segregation of Black children in PPS. After repeated attempts to enroll his children in PPS and being denied, Mr. Brown appealed to the board of education, including directors whose names that I won't recount again. His children were denied access. The school board explained they resisted integrating schools by saying, if we admit them.

This school's existence was called into question until it was finally abolished in 1872, and 30 black students were welcomed into an integrated PPS. And I share that story because we're having the same conversation today over 100 years later. And I want to support. I know that we made a risky move in terms of our fund balance, and we also have an obligation to provide a level of service to the kids that we haven't served in 172 years.

B: Thank Director DePass for those comments and Chair Hollins. I guess I also want to speak to, like, the question of how it was done because we have a budget process and we can offer amendments and the majority of the board gets to make that decision. And I think we had an issue of timing that occurred, that the data on how things were going to land and how community organizations were going to be impacted came very, very late in the process. And it should be noted, and I noted earlier in the tax supervising Conservation commission meeting when they asked about the specific issue is that we spent other money out of the reserves. I mean, we knew last fall that we were going to need to spend money out of our reserves because of the budget situation we were facing. This just happened to be the last money out of the reserves, but it wasn't the only money. So it shouldn't be. If we're going to talk about the money being spent out of the reserves, you know, we could pick one of, you know, any one of the other things in the budget that we didn't, that we didn't cut and we instead spent money out of the reserves. And I would just say at the end of the day, we know that we aren't serving and haven't served students of color well, especially black and native students. And when I look at the list of organizations that are going to be receiving funds and part of it also was not just the organizations that we have partnerships, but also with other organizations that serve other students that we know that haven't been well served is I'm trying to imagine what those organizations, if we didn't fund them, what happens to those students next year is without those additional support. So I just want to say I was fine voting for it because I know again, that other funds came out of the reserve and that I always say, like, if your child's in second grade and needs support. They don't get, they don't get a do over at second grade. So to me, these are an important investment for our students for next year.

A: Chair Holmes, I just need to add those statements are not true. And I think it's worth really saying on the record. We were all told, the entire board was told months ago that the CBO budget was going to be cut. That would have been the moment for a majority of the board to say in those briefings, we're not comfortable with those cuts. We didn't say that. We waited till the last minute. And I agree we have the right to make those amendments. But what we didn't do as a board was take the brave action to actually make those cuts. To director's point, it's not a matter of, oh, this is the last one and it counts as the reserves. No, no. If this is the most important thing, then we absolutely should fund it and then the least important thing should be defunded. We shouldn't just go below our reserve levels because we don't have the bravery as a board to make tough decisions. And that's my point. And frankly, this focus on, like, how important the CBOs are as some sort of counter to my, my argument is really missing what I've said multiple times. These investments are good investments. The process the board engaged in is a bad budget process. That's what's frustrating to me.

B: Excuse me. I'm also a point of personal privilege because those statements aren't untrue. We got the specific cuts to the CBOs and our longtime partners, I think, three to four days before the budget vote. So, yes, while we knew there were going to be cuts made, we didn't know there were going to be very disproportionate cuts. And that's not a criticism at all of staff. I'm just saying it was the facts. We got the list with the cuts and it wasn't. Everybody got cut 20% off the board and we added new. We had some that were cut more than 50% and that was new information. And so, yes, we acted on it, but it's. That wasn't an untrue statement. You may, you may disagree with the action, but we operated on the facts. We operated within the rights of all board members to offer an amendment and the majority of the board voted for it.

It continues to come down to that. We still haven't. We're going to adopt this budget. We haven't made the cuts. We've punted the decision $1.8 million for next year. And it's frustrating for me to be on a board that's willing to do that because we're just. The decisions next year are going to be two or three times as hard as the decisions we made today. But we just added $1.8 million to that through this decision. Nobody has brought forward an amendment. Nobody's brought forward an amendment that actually offsets this and pays for it. That's my issue. Thank you. Any other questions? Discussions? All right, we're gonna go ahead and vote on 6 20. I mean 6920.

First, I'd like to mention on behalf of all workers that last week one of our iron workers died on site at Benson. We understand OSHA is investigating this, but it would be really disrespectful to continue with business as if it didn't happen. PPS workers are saddened by the loss and our hearts go out to this employees, family and co workers. On the topic of the budget, we continue the slide into privatization of a public school district. The amount that was spent on finding a new superintendent via Human Capital Enterprises according to PPS, was $137,000. But we're saving money by doing away with our library assistants, EAs, the print shop, restorative justice employees, adaptive PE teachers, the feeding team, talking about kids alive, bookkeepers, art teachers, the makerspace coordinators, and demanding custodians give back their hazard pay from the ice storm.

I mean, I printed out some nice little reports and I realized, you know what? You guys don't give a damn. I printed this report three weeks ago, shared it with you through my co worker, Sam. Printed out another report for today. One million more clicks in three weeks. One million pieces of paper printed in our shop over the next 72 hours. I'm expected to produce another 200,000 pieces of paper to get out to the students before the end of the school year. Why? Because I've got the books there for the next three years. They're planners. Everything. Sitting in my office, I've got one employee, one co worker out with an injury because she tore her shoulder up trying to get these jobs done. They're trying to kill us down there in the print shop. Granted. They're trying to eliminate the whole sub basement as far as I'm concerned. And then turn around and tell us, nope, your data's all wrong. You don't know what you're doing. Well, that's funny. These reports come out of your own storefront. The very documents, the very system that your teachers use to get everything. And they shut that whole thing down. I've got teachers emailing me. Why isn't the storefront working? Well, Communications sent out an email. Who reads that crap? Communications has become spam. Nobody reads it because it is impossible to read. It's subcategory. Subcategory. Subcategory. You've outsourced everything you can. So you know what's going to happen next? You're going to outsource the print shop. You know what you lose out of that? $300,000 that we bring in from nonprofits. $300,000. A third of our budget that we bring in from outside people.

B: So when Franklin was modernized, the bathrooms were largely designed with only two genders in mind, male and female. There are only three single stall, gender neutral bathrooms in the entire building. Shortly after Franklin's remodel, PBS created a restroom equity plan that recommended that moving forwards, all restrooms be all gender. This includes single occupancy restrooms as well as multi stall or banks of single person toilet rooms. While we applaud this recommendation and how it's been incorporated in subsequent modernization projects, it also means that Franklin, by virtue of being the first PPS high school to be modernized, has missed out on this opportunity. So our big concern here is just that it's going to get skipped. And I'm just jumping that in just the concern that because that part wasn't even thought about at the time, that, that we're not going to ever get that funding to be able to change our bathrooms and be able to have enough bathrooms for everybody. And I'm going to go into some of the things of the situation for the students. I got to chat with a lot of them about how their experiences are, what their experiences have been. So what's the bathroom situation like at Franklin? Some students say that the main issue is that with the bathrooms is there.

B: Gender neutral bathrooms are hard to find and rarely open so that I have given up on using them. I'm going over some quotes here. Another describes that they don't feel safe in either gendered bathrooms and so they end up using the women's bathroom because it's safer. It feels safer even though they have lots of people staring at them. Another student says that it feels like there is some judgment on how you present and students feel pressured to present themselves as more feminine or masculine, that they can't use the gender neutral bathrooms because they, they look more male or female and this makes it uncomfortable to use really any of them. At the moment, we don't have enough gender neutral bathrooms to meet the students needs and many of our students are having to evaluate their safety every time that they decide to use the restroom. Yeah. So how can you help? We have two requests for you tonight. One is to please look into finding funds to increase the number of single stall gender neutral bathrooms on Franklin's campus so that our building can align with the district's restroom equity plan. And two, to fast track approval for the project development request that Franklin submitted in January to convert some of our existing gender facility facilities in the single cell gender neutral bathrooms. Thank you for your time and your continued support for transgender, non, binary and gender expansive students. And Happy Pride month.

Well, I guess it's probably a question to the board, but I would like to refer to this to the facilities and operations committee to look at not just Franklin, but I think it's a really good point. Lots has changed as we've been building over the last 10 years and best practices have changed around restrooms and particularly around having single single user gender neutral restrooms. So I would love the facilities operations committee to take this up and to figure out what is our plan for schools that were built prior to that policy and, and what's our timeline for making those changes.

B: I have a comment as well. I wanted to just appreciate you for bringing that issue forward. I have a lot of bathroom remodeling experience. About 68 parks bathrooms and about 32 Class A high rise in the Lloyd center district bathrooms. And also a little bit of experience converting to gender neutral bathrooms. While I worked at Metro and also as a student at Portland State. I have several trans family members and I know the importance of having safety when one's using the restroom. And I've actually worked with someone, a colleague that had to walk six blocks away to use the restroom while working for a public agency and that's unacceptable. So I agree we should put this directly to the facilities committee and we should make a plan for implementing the retrofits that are needed but also moving forward that we understand these gender neutral spaces or gender inclusive spaces. So I really appreciate you your testimony tonight.

B: Thank you for listening. Thank you. Anna York Hi, Good evening Anna York My last name is spelled Y O R K and tonight I just really wanted to talk about my CTE program. Portland Public Schools has had an educator preparation program for about 10 years now and I was saddened to hear that the board and the district administration were unaware of our existence about a month ago at another board meeting. So tonight I wanted to share some of the things that our programs are doing to help prepare our future educators and let you know what we're doing. Currently there are future Educator, Career and Technical education programs at Franklin, McDaniel, Ida B. Wells and MLC. Sadly, MLC's program will be ending this week as have multiple other schools educator preparation programs since I started my program at Franklin in 2016. While you have had a wonderfully full year in my classroom and I'm so proud of my students work, some things I wanted to share were that my second and third year classes help in a variety of classrooms at Atkinson elementary, which is our neighborhood. They all teach short lessons as well as provide tutoring and small group support for students across the school. We're in the process of transforming that class into a dual credit class with Portland Community College next year. My first year students take a dual credit class already through Portland Community College. It's called Introduction to Education. They split their time between our classroom at Franklin and they all also go to Atkinson about every other week to have the opportunity to read and interact with kindergarteners and first graders in the library. Thanks to the welcomingness of the Atkinson librarian there. Some of the things that we learn in that class include the history of education, we learn about different career opportunities within the education field, universal design for learning, spending the day shadowing a participant or a practicing educator, and just about learning differences that educators might see within their classrooms. This year was the first year that our class was able to present at Portland Community College's Ethnic Studies Conference both in December and in May and they shared their research and advocacy about current issues in the district and the school. This work has included the removal of English selective classes at Franklin High School. It's also advocated for African American Studies at the AP level to be offered as a US History credit, which it currently will not be, and ironically also talking about the gender neutral bathrooms at Franklin and how we don't have enough for students that need them. In addition, the staff are very excited that we were able to host our first ever Educator Preparation day at the district office. Recently, students from Lincoln, Franklin and McDaniel came together to share their work, meet with professionals in the Field and learn about opportunities that are available for them in the future. I really just wanted to say thank you to our CTE administration as well as other district administrators who came and gave some of their time during their busy schedules to meet with my students and the students at the other two schools.

B: Okay. So the last thing I just really wanted to say was I really hope that you all feel welcome to come and visit any of our classrooms. We would love to share with you what we're doing either out in the field at our internship sites throughout the district because McDaniel and Lincoln also have interns that go out to schools in their area or come into our introduction classes and learn a little bit more about our programs. We also would love to have support interacting with the grow your own program at the district level. Right. For adults. We're having a really hard time making connections with that department when we're doing a lot of the same work with our students.

First, I wanted to acknowledge the workers at the print shop. I also want to thank you, Diane, for your passion for our students and your job. And I also want to acknowledge. And Director Green Holmes, this is when you were gone, but I want to acknowledge the person who spoke up to acknowledge the loss of life of an iron worker on the bench and job site. That doesn't happen often, but I appreciate somebody raising it. So I just wanted to speak to those three things.

A: Absolutely. Thank you again for your comments. Please feel free to contact senior board manager Roseanne Bradshaw if you have something specifically you want to follow up with the board or board office. Now we're turn to monitoring our board goals. Interim Superintendent Dr. Huss, would you like to introduce the next item?

B: I'm sorry, Gary. You. You do something I do all the time. You combine a first name and a last name of two amazing people. And they knew you were talking about. So I was taking me a minute to get oriented. Thank you, Chair Hollins. For the second time this evening, I'd like to invite Dr. Renard Adams, Chief of accountability and equity, to walk the board through this recent map data. And as he does that, I'd like to give two pieces of reflection to think about. Anytime you look at achievement data, there are four ways to measure something. Growth over time compared to a standard compared to. Well, now I'm going to Forget compared to yourself over time and compared to potential MAP data is one kind of data. It's not all four. State assessment data is one kind of data. It's not all four. So whenever we get a presentation, I would encourage us to not draw immediate conclusions, just to know this isn't the whole picture. This is a spot in time, And I think Dr. Adams does a great job with that.

start time: 2066:33:40.000
end time: 2071:37:50.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So I just have one question about that, and I'm glad you're here because you have experience. So as a board member, we're looking at the data and we're getting, like, the MAP data today. We get the S back data later on. How do we as a board. I've asked Pat this. How do we as a board know that our kids are learning?

start time: 2072:23:30.000
end time: 2075:36:00.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I think that the best data you have is the whole picture combined with the analysis of somebody from research and instruction together.

start time: 2075:45:00.000
end time: 2078:58:40.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So, for instance, if we look at our SBAC data and we look at our MAPS data and they're both underwhelming, then we know that our kids are performing underwhelmingly well.

start time: 2079:09:00.000
end time: 2097:17:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I'll say this last thing, And I think Dr. Adams can address this better than me because I'm not a researcher. When I look at the student achievement data from a school like Lincoln and I'm going to exaggerate, and a school like Roosevelt, I'm going to expect because of the neighborhoods that they come from, that you will probably see some differences if you're comparing everybody to the Bell Curve. Okay, so what I want to know is, in both schools, really important, what progress did they make over time? I may be scoring high on the Bell Curve, but I didn't grow that much this year. I could be an overachieving kid, and I didn't grow that much this year, or I could be an underachieving kid because I didn't have the same opportunities by the time I got to kindergarten, first and second grade. And I needed a support system to grow faster. So I would want to have the instructional expert and the data and the research saying, this is the picture of what we think is going on. This is the concern we have, and these are the recommendations we have.

start time: 2097:46:30.000
end time: 2348:57:56.000
confidence: 0.96
A: That was very helpful. Thank you. Well, good evening again. Very pleased to be sharing with you our spring data, which focuses on our MAP growth. Our agenda for tonight's presentation will include a review of how we use the assessment in pps, an examination of data across grades three through eight, a disaggregation of those same data by race, ethnicity, and English language learners, special education status and an overview of the current PPS actions to address our results. We will then have time for questions for those who desire additional information. The slide deck includes appendices there. Those slides are gray with student participation counts and rates as well as Data for grades 3 through 5 and 6 through 8 respectively. When trying to do better at honoring the Board Chair's request that there not be 25 slides. So I'm working on that. It's appreciated. I wanted to take just a moment as Dr. Huss started to talk about achievement milestones in PPS. First, in spite of the various disruptions and pandemic related challenges, PPS graduation rates remain steady and strong. This is a testament to the many supports we have at the high school level that catch kids as they fall and support them through activities like credit recovery. When it comes to our statewide assessments in English Language Arts and mathematics, PPS is one of only two districts in all of Oregon whose student achievement has rebounded to pre pandemic levels. We still have a long way to go, but this academic rebound bucks a national trend of continued decline in student achievement. We're not yet satisfied, but we're cautiously optimistic about what may lie ahead. And finally, as we know and as this board has this board has been committed to interrupting and closing gaps in our student performance that fall along the lines of race and ethnicity. Staff are enacting a roadmap to educational equity that we believe will stop this these patterns and begin closing gaps as we call it. Our three big Bets We've placed high quality instructional materials in the hands of every teacher. We have a unified vision of what high quality teaching and learning should look like in every classroom and every school every day. And we're providing, just in time, job embedded professional learning to educators via our principals and their school based instructional coaches. One of the ways we can monitor progress towards achieving educational equity is by examining student growth within each year and over time. Growth and achievement are highly related and I wanted to take just a minute to talk about the relationship between student growth on the map assessment as it relates to student proficiency on assessments like the OSAs. As we move through the presentation, you may notice that our growth percentages are often higher than our OSAS proficiency percentages. Here's why. We know that we have a good number of students who are currently performing below grade level as measured by the state assessment. The books on this slide represent an amount of student growth within a given school year. We know that when students are below grade level they have to grow academically each year and hopefully accelerate their growth so that over time they have more growth or more books under them so that they can reach grade level standards. So under scenario where we are monitoring growth and proficiency, we can have a large proportion of students who are growing and at the same time whose growth has not yet gotten them back to that grade level expectation. In the next few slides, we'll look at our growth in mathematics and reading for all tested grades. And then we'll look at our growth data in each subject by students, race, ethnicity and multilingual learner or special education status. As a reminder, in pps, we assess students in grades three through eight with the MAP assessment in the fall and again in the winter. The data analysis we can produce depend on the timing of the assessment. In the fall, each student has a single score. We can examine achievement at a point in time, and we can also compare ourselves nationally and we can look at achievement over time in two different points. We're now in the spring and after the winter assessment, each student has two scores within the same year. This allows us to examine growth during that year and we can compare growth over time. Growth is an important measure because we know that we want and expect each student to make at least a year's worth of growth for every year they are paired with an effective teacher. When looking at our MAP results, the minimum amount of growth we should expect is at least 50%. When more than 50% of students are growing, we're shifting the distribution of the bell curve that Dr. Husk mentioned of learning and students are accelerating or they're catching up. On the other hand, when we experience growth that is less than 50%, it means that students are declining in their growth and some are falling behind. Let's start with math. Here we are seeing a year over year decline in the percentage of students who are meeting their growth targets. For the current year, 49% of students met their growth targets, which is a 5 percentage point decrease from last year to 20, 22, 23. When examining elementary and middle school results independently, we can see that the overall decline of 49 is a result of a decrease in both elementary and middle school. So our growth is down in math across grades three through eight. So just quick, quick question. So when you explain that if we're at 50% or lower, lower than 50 means some kids are probably not growing as much as they should or slightly. So they might be falling behind. Okay? Yes, sir. As noted on the previous slide, overall mathematics growth is down and below 50%, which typically means that students are falling behind. As I previously mentioned, Here. As we look at these data across our different student groups in grades three through eight, we see declines in growth for all student groups with the exception of our Pacific Islander students. Notably, the following student groups had growth percentages below 50%. Our black students, our Latinx or Latina students, multiracial students who are underserved, our Native students, our English language learners, and our students with disabilities. As we turn to examine reading grades three through eight, we see more stable and steady performance as compared to what we saw at math. Here, the percentage of students in tested grades has consistently demonstrated growth that is slightly greater than 50%. And then we're going to look at these data disaggregated as well. There is a slight 1 percentage point decrease, but again we're above 50% there, so that's better news. When we disaggregate our reading data of students in the tested grades, we note that Latinx students showed a slight increase in growth and students with disabilities remain steady in the percentage of students who met their growth targets. All other student groups showed decreased growth this year as compared to last year. Of particular concern are student groups who student groups excuse me, whose growth percentages are below 50%. These student groups include our Asian students, our Black students, our Latino students, multiracial students who are underserved again, our Native students, Pacific Islanders, our English language learners, and our students with disabilities. Next, I'll discuss and highlight some of the things we're doing that should help to address these data. 1. We've provided student learning analysis protocols for building leaders and instructional coaches focused on understanding the map data. So what we're doing there is giving people a structure for how they can look at student outcome data to think about what instructional adjustments they could make. So we provided those protocols and we've trained our instructional coaches who are the principal's lever for increasing building capacity among the educators. We continue to provide professional learning for building leaders and instructional coaches around math and ELA instruction, and we're going to continue to provide that. One of the things we know in working with Chief Bruno and being a former special educator is we know we've identified that universal design and scaffolding is an area where we know we need to strengthen our professional learning. You often will hear teachers talk about meeting students where they are and what I would offer to you is that's not quite enough because if I meet a sixth grader reading on third grade level where he is, then I'm always teaching him at the third grade level for a while and he doesn't ever get exposure to that grade level expectation. And so what I would offer is we want our educators to understand where students are, to meet them there, and then scaffold them with supports to the grade level expectation. And so we continue to provide professional learning around how to do that. Our senior directors of school from the office of student performance under Chief Dr. Franco review their network or cohort of schools, their map growth results, and they work with our building leaders to make adjustments to their focus strategies and efforts that are found in their school and school continuous improvement plans. And then in addition to that, we had Dr. Franco had his senior directors meet with each school's instructional leadership team. That is a team that's typically comprised of the principal, the assistant or vice principal, the instructional coach, and other teacher leaders who are charged with really understanding the school, the school continuous instructional improvement plan, and going about knowing and understanding what professional learning and other opportunities are needed to move the school forward based on its situational context within the students that they have in the building, the community in which they sit. And so I have just three takeaways and I promise to keep it brief so we could have lots of time for discussion. So we know that our students mathematic growth decreased to below 50% for the current year, While reading growth remains steady. It is likely that school interruptions have contributed to the current student growth results. We know we had the teacher strike. We know that meant that students were not in school for all of November. We had makeup days. Those makeup days fell. A significant portion of those makeup days fell during winter break. And we know that our attendance waned during that week as we monitored it. And then we had the vicious ice storms that I was promised I wouldn't deal with when I moved over here, I might add, that lasted for a week and sent some schools closed, several schools, some that are still remaining closed and damaged many others. And then lastly, we look at these data and we stand committed to our theory of action around giving people high quality materials, around giving them just in time professional learning and support in their buildings and in having a unified idea of what teaching and learning should look like in every school, in every classroom, every day. And we do that with our instructional framework by breaking down what observable teacher and educator behaviors are and what are observable student behaviors that we can expect if things are really clicking and moving in the way that we really hope that they would. And with that, I and possibly team members are helpful, are ready to have some discussion and answer any questions you might have. So I guess I'LL start with a couple questions. So you're talking about some of the likelihoods of the decline. Do we have any data that we can go to or data points that we can go to to actually pinpoint where those decline were? When you look at all the different data points, whether it's maps, we're looking at maps, SBAC and any other assessments, that tool should happen. That's a great question. So what we would have needed to really say school closures absolutely caused this is we would need a group of PPS students who didn't experience any school closures to compare to the students who actually experienced the school closures. But we don't have that. But what we can say is we know there were gaps in instructional time, that we've tried to make that up as much as possible, but there have also been disruptions. You know, we've got, as you all know, Markham elementary that's been spread across four different campuses. We had combined middle schools between Robert Gray and Jackson, and. And that our students and our staff are incredibly resilient. But that is some turmoil when you're thinking about. I'm used to my neighborhood school. I'm used to walking to school. I still see my trusted adults, but I don't see all of them because we may not all be in the same building. And so I don't want to discount the impact that that likely had on our results. So when we look at. So when looking at the math from three days and we went from 57, 54 to 49. So if we're looking at the data before the disruptions. Right. Which was still a decline of 3. Is it. Are we. Were we anticipating declining less or were we looking to go well, I'm always hoping that we stay steady or we increase. Right. I have. I'm going to remain optimistic about our OSAS results because even with, for example, last year's 20, 22, 23 a decline compared to 21, 22, we still saw some increases in our math OSAS data. And so what I want to believe is just in the incredible power of our educators and our students to rise to the challenge. It's been a year. I think we all can admit that, and many of us are counting down. I know my teacher friends are counting down. You know, only so many more days to go, Renard. But who's counting? And I want to remain optimistic until we get those results so we can really see what's going on. Any other board questions? Yeah.

end time: 2358:39:18.000
confidence: 0.96
A: But that's the map. Assessment is normed on the bell curve. So if you get 50%, it means at least half of the students have grown as much as they could have. We also have students who've grown but haven't met their growth target. So that. So my growth target may have been five points and maybe I grew through your instructional facilitation three points. We don't get credit for that, but we can examine that to see our students growing over time.

A: It'S what their growth was from between each of scores. Right. So I scored, let's say 200 in September, and then in January I scored 203.

start time: 2362:21:12.000
end time: 2363:35:44.000

A: It's all right.

start time: 2374:38:10.000
end time: 2387:29:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So I'm just comparing slide 20 to slide 7, where we have the reading growth rates at 50. This is grades 3 to 8 at 51%. But then I go back to slide 20 and I'm wondering if I'm looking at white students. Growth 52%. And then black students is 46. Latinx is 48, Native American 43. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders is 39. Is the 50% actually more. Because we have just in terms of absolute numbers, more white students, which brings the whole average.

start time: 2387:40:40.000

A: That is very much the case.

start time: 2388:23:20.000
end time: 2389:52:00.000

start time: 2390:43:36.000
end time: 2419:14:02.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Okay. Because I think that's just instructive for decision making around our budget and where we're focused. And then this is a more general question. I'm going back to in the single digits, find the slide number, the slide nine, the ongoing PPS actions. And I love the systemic approach because I think that's what we need. For too long we had curriculum that was all over the place. We didn't have formative assessments, a whole host of things that were missing. So I love the systemic approach that's captured here. I'm going to go back though, to I think the very first presentation we had on the. And I think the Auckle principal at the Time. Who's now our interim. Is this right? Who's now the interim chief academic officer presented how the MAPS data could. You could help teachers in their individual classrooms. And when I look at this I don't see a teacher, a direct teacher component. So to click down to that level. And so I'm curious whether we still view if it's still viewed as a tool for teacher ways to sort of zero in on where students specifically are at points in time other than OSAs at the end of the year when they're off to the next grade. So I'm curious about that because it's not mentioned on the. And I don't know, maybe you're focusing on the systemic actions but is it still a tool for teachers?

start time: 2419:16:26.000
end time: 2439:35:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I appreciate that feedback the teacher related actions would be captured in the first bullet around the student learning analysis. But. But teachers aren't explicitly called out. So I appreciate you pointing that out. One of the things that I'm a believer of as a, as a educator is we're trying to get our schools and teachers to focus on the curriculum embedded assessments the most. Look at your MAP data when it comes out. Hopefully it reinforces what you already know based on what you're teaching your students and how they're responding to your instructional facilitation. But the curriculum embedded assessments are happening at either even a more frequent cycle. They might be every four weeks or every three and a half weeks or every eight weeks depending on the grade level. And so if we're analyzing those assessments and making instructional adjustments in the moment. My belief and we're exposing students to the rigor and structure of the grade level expectation and standard. My belief is the map growth takes care of itself. OSAS takes care of itself because you're using the instrument that's closest to what you and how you just taught in the curriculum embedded assessments.

start time: 2439:46:30.000
end time: 2445:08:32.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I appreciate that. And I wasn't, I guess I wasn't providing feedback. It was a curiosity and I think maybe the difference between then and now. So that was maybe seven years ago approximately. I don't know that we had curriculum embedded assessments. So this was, this was the primary tool.

start time: 2445:10:16.000
end time: 2445:18:56.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yes.

start time: 2445:20:48.000
end time: 2456:10:04.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Okay, great. So as again, I really appreciate the more systemic approach because I think in the past it's been more hit and miss what school you're in, who the principal was, what the classroom teachers were using. And I think what our students deserve is more sort of uniform support. And this looks like it. So I'm appreciative. I don't have any other questions. Ongoing giving Us the trends. I guess I'm a little bit concerned by just the general trend lines on some of the slides, especially the disaggregated data. Is there something we should be looking for?

start time: 2456:11:52.000
end time: 2476:39:36.000
confidence: 0.96
A: My fingers stay crossed. Okay, I'm concerned as well, but I want to be optimistic and, and wait until we have all the data back from osas. Our students are just finishing up with that assessment and we'll have those data at the end of the summer. Towards September is usually when the ODE allows us to publicly release them. The other thing I'd like to add, Director Brimo Edwards, is the assessment team that works under my leadership has worked really hard with Christina Howard, our Chief Academic Officer's team, and we've included on our assessment calendar all the required curriculum embedded assessments and when they likely should be given so that principals and instructional leadership teams have an idea of when they could expect teacher teams to be looking at student work. Along those lines, like when are we given that writing assignment in Wit and Wisdom in fourth grade? Oh, that should be completed by the first week of October. So around the second week of October or the third week, we could look at that student work as a grade level team and then think about how students are performing. And so we're really trying to systematize some structures and some protocols and supports for schools. Yes.

start time: 2476:41:28.000
end time: 2485:52:10.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Chair Hollins, can I just add to that? I think when you look at that, you can ask a question, are our kids not learning quickly enough? Or you could flip it and you could say what? Teachers in what schools are getting such amazing progress that we want to use them as exemplars so that we can all learn from them. Because when you find those spots of brilliance and we have them, if we highlight that, it'll be motivating to those that are working really hard and need to know some other strategies to try and especially from their colleagues.

start time: 2486:01:50.000
end time: 2501:54:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Actually, I'm glad you said that because that was actually a bit of a follow up. How do we know if we can get, if we can get down to the individual individualized student, how do we know the teachers are actually using it and how do we know they're making those adjustments? So Dr. Franco isn't here because he's under the weather, but I would say that our senior directors of school schools are charged with that implementation of the instructional program. And so in their walkthroughs and their discussions with principals and they're sitting in data team meetings, it is our expectation that they are reinforcing and monitoring for those results because we know we need to inspect what we expect. And I know that they are doing that work and I wish Dr. Franco was here to talk it up in more detail than I can. Just so I'm clear. So it goes from the senior director to the principal, to the principals to the teachers. Yes.

start time: 2502:08:20.000
end time: 2504:32:12.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And okay, just to add to that, teachers also have yearly evaluations from the teachers which they're through their. I forgot what it's called.

start time: 2504:32:36.000
end time: 2504:59:56.000
confidence: 0.84
A: But you know, every category is marked.

start time: 2505:00:28.000
end time: 2506:19:20.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Meets or exceeds or proficient or does not meet. And those are ratings as well.

start time: 2506:35:00.000
end time: 2512:56:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: But I think the only issue with that is that when you have the evaluation of a teacher that's not tied to their kids performance. So if we've been looking at these, we've been looking at these numbers historically that has been going down, down, down, down. I don't know how effective those evaluations are. And if you look at. Once again, look at the data and those numbers have been going down.

start time: 2514:32:30.000

start time: 2518:43:10.000
end time: 2521:20:08.000
confidence: 0.98
A: We typically in September look at student achievement compared to how students are doing nationally and how they did the previous fall.

start time: 2521:22:14.000
end time: 2522:07:00.000
confidence: 0.83
B: Okay. Oh, previous fall, not the winter.

start time: 2522:08:20.000
end time: 2531:01:42.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Right. Because they're the reason we don't look at winter. We've not been emphasizing winter to fall. Data is you have those months in summer where students may or may not be in school and they have the summer slide. And so there's so many things that could have happened where we're looking from fall to winter. We know they were in school with us. All right, Dr. Green, he doesn't have any questions. Not at all. I'm just gonna throw this out there for anybody to see where it sticks though. Going Back to page 9, I love.

start time: 2531:02:06.000
end time: 2531:41:58.000
confidence: 0.98
B: The systemic thing, stuff that we're putting in place.

start time: 2531:42:54.000
end time: 2580:50:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: My questions would be around measuring. How are we measuring the. Both the implementation of it and the adaptation in that. How are we measuring to make sure we've done this with an entire school or have we not? So if we look at a per school, can we say that every teacher in this school or every educator in this school has gone through this level of training and of that how many of those teachers or educators or whomever are actually using the training? Because there's a difference between getting the training and actually using the training that you have actually gotten. So can we correlate or how are we measuring what they have been given and then how they're using what they've gotten, and then are we able to curtail and see results from the ones to say the ones that are using it are getting results and the ones that are not, aren't. And so I'm gonna throw that out there because you just said Franco isn't here, and I'm sure that he's gonna be the one to possibly. I'm in everybody's business. I know a little bit about everything. I'mma throw that out there as something that has been heard. Somebody should get back and answer the question. What I'm. I can offer you a response. There's a couple different ways we can understand how well, to what extent our professional learning is being turnkeyed in schools. One way is through the Office of Teach Professional Learning. That's the office that's charged with training the instructional coaches and being in contact with. With the instructional coaches about how successful they're being in their jobs in terms of. I was able to turnkey this professional learning. I haven't had the time or space to do it yet. We're two modules behind. We're not having PLC meetings. We are having PLC meetings, and teachers are talking about data. So that's one of the ways we know. The other thing we've done this year is we created an instructional walkthrough tool that staff have been using. Senior directors and other staff from the teaching and learning office have been using when they're in buildings and observing instruction. So we can get calibrated and understand the extent to which, you know, basically on a basic level, how to what extent do we see curricular adoption and use by teachers? Then when we're seeing curricular adoption and use by teachers, there are these things called the core actions that are specific moves that we expect teachers and students to make during instruction. We look and can measure the extent to which we see those specific moves happening because we know if those specific. What we know and believe is if those specific moves called the core actions, are happening, student learning is taking off. So those are two of the ways. And then I'll also ask Dr. Frankel for more info when he's back in the office.

start time: 2580:52:50.000
end time: 2581:43:50.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Thank you. Thank you for that. So you mentioned that we can.

start time: 2581:58:10.000
end time: 2613:07:00.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So then the question would become, are we? And is that a tool or metric that we can then begin to see every time we talk about the data that we also talk about who's actually using it and who's not using it? I'm a firm believer in the thing that you measure or the Thing that you count get success. And so I would like to put. I would like to move us to a space where we have conversations and we allow the data to lead the conversation. And the data is the data. Whoever is doing it, they're doing it. And whoever is not, they're not, but the data is the data. And I would like to see a lot more of the data around the types of professional learning that we're doing, because you put it in here. Professional learning for the building leaders and instructors, instructional coaches. I'd like to see more about who's actually using it and who's not and what are we doing to ensure that everybody has access to the same information so that those that may not be using it are not using it because they simply don't want to. Maybe if they didn't have access to it, or maybe. But we are, we are pushing that. If we believe that this is what it's going to take to help us move the needle, then we should be ensuring that everyone that's going to be leading and educating is doing what we want them to do. And if they're not doing what we want them to do, then they need to find another space to do what they want to do. But it shouldn't be in PPS. So I can certainly work with Ms. Howard and Dr. Armstrong on understanding what kind of information we can present to the board. I thought personally that some of our conversations around the curriculum that we had earlier in the school year, coupled with implementation data, I think we had some very robust conversations around that. So we could continue that. I'll talk with Dr. Armstrong and Ms. Howard about that. Absolutely.

confidence: 0.94
B: Are we going in a line? Thank you for that. Pardon me? I said sort of. Sort of. Sort of popcorn, sort of in line. Okay. I can roll with punches. I'm really curious about learning more about this idea of measuring curriculum adoption or the rate of adoption in schools. And also like, interested in learning what those core actions are, those look fors. When I looked at the presentation, I was. I know it's aggregated. Is there. Do we have any exemplars? I mean, I'm sure we do. Dr. Husk mentioned that we do, but. But where are those exemplars? And I wonder if there's a way we can use behavioral science to.

So, yeah, I'm interested in knowing a little bit more about the rate of adoption, how we measure that and are we Just measuring that by the outcomes, test outcomes, or there are other things we're looking for. And then where are those exemplars within our school district that are. That are getting the kids to where, over the finish line?

start time: 2633:43:30.000
end time: 2639:44:58.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Sure, we can look into that. And we are measuring based on what we observe in the buildings. So we're not waiting until we get map data back or we get OSAs data back. We're in schools on a regular cadence, spending time in classrooms observing what teachers are doing. We also debrief with a group of teachers after each visit and with the principal.

start time: 2639:47:54.000

confidence: 0.97
B: Okay. And then you don't have to name the schools, but are there schools within our district that are doing a better job of teaching black and brown kids, not teaching where the achievement. The scores of black and brown kids are higher than the average or higher than the aggregated data would show?

I think you heard Principal Barry really boil it down initially to beliefs like we believe that all the. All our students are brilliant, bright and capable just as they are. And we know that. I know that from being a teacher. My students went as far as I believed I could take them and I believe they could go. So it's the combination of both of those things.

There's people who opt out of testing, right. So it's never going to be 100%. But then when I look at black, we have 74%. Latin 8, 77%. You know, multiple hu. 78%. I mean, this is 78%?

Dr. Franco sends a weekly newsletter to all of his building leaders each Monday, and we put the participation rates of all the schools in that newsletter while the windows are open. And I know that senior directors of school, I, I, I can think of a few that have encouraged some healthy competition around participation rates among their schools. We still have work to do, as you can see.

A: I think it's possible. Right. We know butts and seats matter, like you said. Well, you didn't say it quite like that. Yeah, I like that. But we know that matters. And what I would offer is I would not believe attendance should necessarily be a barrier when we have a lengthy window within which you can assess a student. So if I'm absent on Monday and I come back on Wednesday, you have the next two and a half weeks to assess me because the window is, you know, five or six weeks, whatever it is, at the moment. Okay. I just, I'm just thinking about, I'm looking, trying to look behind the numbers, I think, you know, because one thing about testing, you know, my analogy I've.

B: My gosh, I saved you from being last. So on slide nine, the third bullet point where it talks about making adjustments to the strategies in the skips, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about like what those adjustments look like or if you have any specific examples.

start time: 2723:13:30.000
end time: 2740:43:00.000
confidence: 0.96
A: You're actually catching me with a blank. Director Stein. What I could say is regarding the skip is there's usually a three part action step. If the instructional leadership team does X, teachers will do Y and students will be able to do Z. And we empower building leaders with their instructional leadership teams to really think about what those actions are based on their in their school and students data. And so what you want to be able to say by monitoring map data and those curriculum embedded assessments is what we're doing doesn't appear to be working. Let's not wait until next September to find out it didn't work. It isn't. Doesn't appear to be working. We've been trying it since September. It's now December. Maybe we need to course correct and make a little adjustment. And this is. Those are the types of things that happen as a part of those conversations.

confidence: 0.95
A: Quite welcome. Okay. Director Scott, you have any questions? No, just really appreciate the conversation. All the questions so far and listening to the. Yeah. So thanks everybody. I just have two more questions and that's it. So I've been on like three instructional walks which I think they've been. One was learning. It was really under get an understanding of these instructional walks. One question is, can you describe the follow up piece of the data that's gathered during those instructional walks and what's the next steps for those? I would love it if Ms. Howard would come down if she's here and help me with that. And then I asked a second question while she's coming down. Do we have faith in our senior directors that they can lift what's needed in schools? Well, I certainly do. One of the things we talk about, we meet. We've been meeting pretty regularly. Dr. Frankel meets with them weekly. But we've been meeting pretty pretty regularly as like a teaching and learning team and talking about the same things we ask our building leaders to talk about with their staff. We're building Our own capacity, we're increasing our own muscle, we're calibrating. So am I seeing the same thing in that third grade classroom that Ms. Howard saw? And then we're trying to also coordinate and collaborate our responses. Like we. If we both have a school where similar patterns are occurring with similar students, what is our similar approach to try to give some support to that building leader with some accountability. And Ms. Howard could talk more about the follow up. Thank you for coming down.

start time: 2769:00:04.000
end time: 2773:16:40.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Do I have to? Hi. So a couple of things to know. I'm not sure if you went on an instructional round or if you went on like a learning walk. We have a couple of different ways that we were approaching going into classrooms through learning.

start time: 2773:18:00.000
end time: 2776:04:24.000
confidence: 0.91
A: I don't know which one I did. We walked around school and we had notepads and we were looking for look fors teachers and probably a learning walk.

start time: 2776:05:52.000
end time: 2807:26:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Okay, you had a clipboard. It was official. Although we do that with the instructional rounds. But I guess the essence of that is in both spaces, whether it's learning walk or an instructional round. The idea is that we're building our capacity. So that's generally principals, instructional coaches, central office members, guests. Right. Participating. And so the idea is that we're building our capacity and then through the debrief process, if we're talking about a learning walk, it's generally a three or four hour structure where we end up each group because we split into math and ELA and each group debriefs and then we have a whole group debrief with both subject areas. And the principal gets a lot of action steps. And then the senior director of schools under Dr. Franco's team facilitates that conversation and then works with the building leader. And just like our coaching model has actually at the end a follow up. So the idea is that then they would follow back up with that building leader to see it in action. Because if we're talking about coaching and taking a coaching stance with either a building leader or an instructional coach, we want to make sure that whatever we're working on with them in the form of a specific action step is actually happening. Happening to your point. Right. And so the idea is in a coaching model is just not one and done, you want to be able to go back, see it in action or ask for evidence of that through an artifact or ask for a follow up coaching conversation they maybe had with that teacher. Show me, model for me how you did that so I can continue to give you more feedback. And then we want to see improvement happen. That's the Whole purpose of that.

start time: 2807:26:50.000
end time: 2807:34:58.000

A: Right.

start time: 2807:37:14.000
end time: 2831:59:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: And so I think this is a learning journey. If you even think about where we're at in curriculum implementation. I know we've been up here over and over saying that, but that's in itself. The coaching piece is also we're learning and we're grappling with that and we're learning how to coach around specific indicators that you saw on the paper on your clipboard, I'm sure. And so I think that that's the piece too, is we're trying to build the capacity of our school supervisors. We're trying to build the capacity of our coaches and the building leader and ourselves at the same time. And it's going to take some time and we have to practice and we have to get in this habit of giving feedback because feedback is necessary to improve. And so this is also an area that we're working through. And I think. I know Dr. Franco is not here tonight, but really the Senior Director of Schools and then my team, we've been really working this year and trying to align and get really tight on how we work together and how the vision needs to be growing in the same direction. And so that's also an area that we're really trying to get better at. And Dr. Adams has been part of that. And Chief Buno, he's been part of that as well. And I think that's been really helpful this year to really get on the same page. But it's a learning journey and we're not. We're not all the way there yet at all.

I want to turn this over to my colleague to provide updates on their committees. We also have a request from Director Sullivan to have some time to hear a bit more about the Student Climate Summit from Kat Davis, advisor for the Climate justice and one of the student participants. Is Kat still here? And the student. All right. Away in the back. All right. Thanks for your patience. Thanks for being here so late. Right, you're up, Dr. Self. I mean, Director Sullivan.

B: Sorry. Well, I went to the Climate Summit and was really excited about what I. I saw and just invited Kat. I hoped she'd been earlier tonight, but sorry that it's so late and just really appreciate your coming and appreciate what you're doing and it was just really an exciting place to be. So please tell us more. Thank you so much, Directors, for having us here tonight. We're eager to get to share with you a Little update, A brief update. So last month, over 150 students from seven different high schools across the district gathered at the Red Building on Salmon street for the second annual PPS Climate Summit. And the event school was to connect students with leaders from across the district around the power of climate action through the seed of the event, which was Seeds of Change. And at the Summit, students heard from State Representative Khan Pham about environmental justice and from representatives of the Portland Clean Energy Fund as well as meeting with local author Elizabeth Doerr. They had a chance to meet with over 20amazing community partners for some hands on projects and learning and participate in a project management workshop as well. So the Summit was really made possible by key input from our Climate Justice Youth Advisory, which is made up of dedicated and passionate high school students from across the district and that acted as thought partners in defining our climate justice initiatives and leadership this year, as well as really helping us understand what students really need out of this community engagement. So in order to learn a little bit more about it, I invited Issa Taylor to come speak with me, who spoke at the Summit and has been amazingly involved not only in the Climate Justice Youth Advisory, but also the District Student Council and our PPS Design team. Issa's just everywhere. So thanks so much for joining us.

The Summit included a workshop on how we as students can actually create and lead a climate project at our schools and hosted a lot of really cool organizations that each impact our community in meaningful ways. It also hosted very informative Q and A sessions with Representative Pham and organizations involved in climate work such as the Portland Clean Energy Fund. As a member of the Youth Advisory Team, I played an integral role in planning the event by giving recommendations and feedback on organizations who wanted to attend the Summit. I also gave feedback on Summit tabling and how the actual event should be laid out. During the actual event, I acted as.

B: Besides going to your summit, I had the opportunity a couple of weeks ago to attend an awards ceremony that was hosted by a group called Communicare. Now I really didn't know much about Communicare, but I got the invitation, they had a dinner, so I went and it was really a great event. And I want to give a shout out to the students that are involved in this program. The program sponsored by the Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundation. The purpose of the program is to give students that are interested in service to their community the opportunity to contribute financial grants to nonprofits of their choice. And the way you talked about, the way you organized sounds a lot about how these students organize for their program. So there's many steps in this year long process. First, the students choose a community issue that they care about. Then they write a brief mission statement outlining their grant making priorities for the year. Each group starts out with $7,500 and can double their money through fundraising. With a fundraising goal of $750, every dollar raised will be matched 10 times up to 15,000. Students choose their own fundraising activities. So they're going to have $15,000 if they raise the 750 to give to a group of their group or groups of their choice. So from November through January, nonprofits submit applications. Students can conduct their own research into Oregon nonprofits and invite them to apply. And nonprofits can also apply directly to a mission statement that the students have written without an invitation through the public web submission portal on Communicare's website. Then, in January and February, the student groups develop their own evaluation criteria and review applications. And they select three to four organizations for interviews. And in March and April, the students schedule and conduct an interview or site visit with each of their top nonprofit picks using interview questions they develop. And after interviewing for superintendent, I realize that's not easy. So they do a lot of work for this. Then in April, they choose which nonprofits will receive the grants and how much each will receive. In May, there is a celebration where the checks are presented to the recipients. And that's what I attended. That's what I saw. All comprehensive Portland Public high schools and alliance at MEEC participate in the program. And also there's lots of high schools throughout the state of Oregon. Sometimes there are multiple groups at a single school. All schools participate in a celebration. The one that I attended was one of six in the Portland area schools. So I'd like to give a shout out to the many students in Oregon who gave their time to this program. I was able to see four of our PPS high school schools give presentations and want to give them special recognition. McDaniel was represented by three groups. A business management class, Justice Lab class, and a business launch class. Jefferson was represented by their international human rights club, alliance was represented by its leadership class, and Lincoln by its Communicare club. I would also like to recognize the teachers who served as advisors. These innovative programs would not be possible without their support. But I was just really impressed by the amount of work they have to do through the whole year and, you know, really learn about the community by doing that.

And thank you for nurturing and supporting our students and really amplifying their voice because they were very instrumental in helping develop the policy. But thank you for your continuing to support students and also our staff as we strive to meet our climate goals. And also for being our temporary DSC advisor for just like the beginning of the year. That was way fun.

confidence: 0.95
B: So we met earlier this week. We have three, it seems like it was days ago. We have three primary policies under consideration. First, Director Wong has brought forward some modification, proposed some modifications to our travel policy and we're in the process of gathering data that we'll consider next meeting. And then second, we had, I describe it as an initial exploration of a PPS policy relating to AI in pps, both how it. It could be used in positive ways, in ways that maybe not, not so positive. But again, it was a preliminary conversation just assessing kind of what, what the various issues of how So I think as Director Wong pointed out, AI has been around for a long time reminding us spell check is most basic type of AI. But really looking at what are the implications for sort of the evolving nature of how AI is used in the classroom and our school districts and by students and staff. And then the third topic, we're continuing committee discussion and work about potentially on a district wide cell phone use policy. And I want to thank student Rep. Frankie for volunteering to take the lead on a student survey regarding a cell phone policy. At the very front end, I'm sure we will get throughout the process, have lots of feedback from students, I guess, parents and others and staff about a policy. But I really appreciate your taking the lead on that as we begin the work.

A: Awesome. Jones. Yes. Just wanted to jump in. It just happened to be relevant. I'm actually at a conference, which is why I'm not attending today. We had a keynote speaker on Sunday, Casey Newton, who speaks about technology and its intersection. And I'm just putting this out there, it's one, one voice. But he, he really recommended the governments not adopt AI policies at this point because of the constant changes that are going on. So he really recommends that we continue to look at it very closely, which it sounds like the policy committee is doing, which I appreciate. But I think it's worth sort of having this conversation about, you know, whether we want to actually be adopting a policy or whether we want to be prepared to adopt a policy at some point in the future. And it kind of sounded director members like that ladder was maybe where you were headed anyway, but just it hit a key. There was a keynote speaker that I heard that seemed very relevant to the conversation.

start time: 3083:05:38.000
end time: 3102:18:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah, I really appreciate that and we'd love to have whatever if you want to come present at the committee, that'd be great. But. And in the vein that you talked about, we did say we're at the point that we're exploring it and we've had a pretty explicit discussion that it would be fairly high level and probably very high level guidance. And there also is going to be likely other policies that are implicated. There might have AI implications, but we wouldn't want to be too specific or detailed. Again, it's a rapidly evolving field and we don't want to be in the business of like changing the policy all the time. So I think what you're pointing out is something that we've also considered in the committee and will continue to consider and you can pressure test whether we've met the Is it high level enough that you have some sort of values and guidance that can stand somewhat the test of at least for a period of time versus something that is immediately dated, you know, in a short period of time.

A: Great. And also too, we actually went to a seminar on that when we was at the NASP conference and they talked about that too. So we have some information as well we can bring back. And to bring back some information, Dr. Green is in my ears and make sure you bring back information. All right, next is a facilities and operations committee. We just really talked about bond planning and then we had a good conversation with about the Grand Bowl. Looks like they're going to do some fundraising for the to make the grand bowl lights situation happens. So we're going to keep you guys updated on that. And then we don't have no more superintendent search updates because we've already hired one. So that's it. All right, next is the consent agenda. The board will now vote on the consent agenda. Board members, if there's any items you would like to pull for discussions, we will set those aside for the next time we meet. Ms. Bradshaw, are there any changes to the consent agenda?

A: Has also been willing to pay $90,000 to someone who was getting fired to fire them. So I feel like, you know, $53,000 across 200 custodians, who, in many cases, as I mentioned, risk their lives to keep our schools going. If you all could see it in your hearts to forgive that, we would be appreciative, especially with, you know, a new superintendent coming in and hopefully a reset in relations with the unions. We would definitely appreciate your consideration on that. That's all I've got. Thank you.
