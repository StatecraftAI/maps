A: Thank you. And then I'm going to just note that Michelle De Pass is also a member of this committee. She's not able to come today. So if we are going to send anything out of committee today, it will, I think it will be a sense of the committee since Michelle's not here and obviously you can share your point of view, but it will be going to the full board. So that should work. Do you know how she's going to vote? All right, next we're going to turn to public comments. I'm going to note that we had some written public comment that's been submitted, that's been posted, and also we have some public comment for today. Yes. Would you like me to call them individually or there's two people signed up together. Since there's. We're down here in this room, you can call them individually. Okay. Christine Hanilski. Great.

D: Thank you. My name is Christine Hannilsey. I'm the vice president of Oya no Kai, which is the parent organization that oversees the Japanese dual language immersion program. And I'm here speaking on behalf of the JDLI as well as the Mandarin and the Vietnamese programs. We're here to talk about the proposed policy change for international travel programs. And I wanted to start off first by thanking the committee for all the hard work that you put into drafting a policy that we found to be fair and equitable and exactly the sort of thing that will contribute to the success of this program. We understand that the district had some responses and some additional arguments to modify your proposal. And I wanted to point out a couple of things, discrepancies and maybe misstatements that showed up in that policy letter. While we appreciate that the district wants to allow an additional two days for travel time, especially for these long programs, we don't think that that really addresses the original concern that the committee was focused on, which was allowing enough time for an immersion language program, an academic program, to actually be successful for the students, I'm just going through a couple of quick things here. My full statement is in the packet. I wanted to point out that the fiscal impact that was described in the packet in the staff letter was not actually entirely correct. They listed out the substitute fees, the cost of the programs, things like that. But what they did not explain was that none of those costs are borne by PPS or by non traveling students or families or by individual schools. Those are all paid through trip fees, independent fundraising, grants, things like that that the parent organizations organize. So there is no actual fiscal impact to PPS for these programs. My two minutes already. I also just wanted to quickly say that to the best of our knowledge, there is no data from PPS that supports their assertion that 10 days out of the classroom, the home classroom, will lead to significant learning loss or other difficulties in integrating back into the classroom on their return. On the other hand.

confidence: 0.92
D: Thank you for hearing me out. As a former student, I'm concerned by the unilaterally anti technology nature of the proposed policy. My name is Jade Cislavski. Many students, both ones with and without.

A: Disabilities, think of their personal devices as an extension of their personal capabilities. An attitude that's honestly going to be really good for them in college and the workplace. Given how much note taking communication with professors and so on happens almost entirely on devices.

start time: 98:34:10.000
end time: 101:27:10.000
confidence: 0.93
D: And a policy that's focused exclusively on taking away or limiting use of devices is definitely the easy way to enforce uniformity and maintain discipline in the classroom.

start time: 101:34:10.000
end time: 103:31:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: But I strongly believe it's worth the effort to try to work with rather than against students technological adaptations to their environment.

start time: 104:02:10.000
end time: 106:45:26.000
confidence: 0.92

A: Thank you. I see the remainder of my time. Thank you for coming today and sharing your point of view. That concludes who we have signed up for public comment. Great. Thank you. Those individuals who came to share their perspectives. The next items on our agenda we have. First, we're going to have a discussion about two policies that are currently we've had a lot of discussion about and revisions and potentially looking today at moving them out of committee potentially if we're done, if we feel like they're ready for our first reading for comment. The first one is high school credit earned prior to ninth grade and we have the revisions in front of us and I think what I'm Would you like to make a presentation? Yes. Okay. So if you could introduce yourself and maybe a short presentation on the changes this policy relating to high school credit earned prior to ninth grade. There's been community questions, concerns, recommendations made and also there's been, I think a robust discussion with our educators at this district. So if you want to go ahead and share the changes that you're proposing to bring forward, then we'll have either any committee discussion or questions.

A: School Academics and Good afternoon. Lorna Fass, Buffalo Horse, Senior Director of Secondary Schools and MPG Programs and we are back to discuss further revisions to the policy which allows PPS schools to grant high school credit before ninth grade. Since our last time before you, we have met with the two TAG Advisory Committee co chairs or TAG ACT co chairs.

start time: 151:11:40.000
end time: 166:04:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: We shared with TAG ACT co chairs that we have refined our proposed changes for the policy 6 period 10 period 100p to differentiate between essentially two things. One, how we relate to industry cases where students have the opportunity to earn high school credit while in middle school and then how we treat transfer students who are transferring into Portland Public Schools for in district cases in PPL's middle schools, we as a district have responsibility to ensure that the content, materials, assessments, standards, facilities, time allocation and teacher qualifications are all equivalent to high schools for the specific courses designated by the superintendent to be eligible for high school credit.

start time: 166:22:20.000
end time: 178:09:10.000
confidence: 0.97
A: And for the non PPS cases. We really worked in this version to try to clarify that students with credits on a transcript from an accredited high school will be able to transfer those credits into a PPS high school and count them toward graduation at pps. This applies whether a student earned those credits prior to ninth grade or during high school. The key here is that the sending school district recognized those credits as high school credits by placing them on a high school transcript. As long as the sending school is accredited, those credits are treated the same as any other transfer credits.

start time: 178:45:30.000
end time: 203:05:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: So if this policy is approved, we will then begin working on the administrative directives. The ad will detail how families of PPS middle school students will be notified of course as eligible for high school credit as well as the implications for grades earned in middle school as far as transcripts are concerned. Currently, notifications happen through middle school counselors who review information with middle school students and families during form forecasting. This happens every year. This includes courses that are eligible for high school credit. Every year. School admin, particularly our middle school admin, are informed of district expectations regarding staffing and scheduling. And so for our middle school colleagues, that includes clarifying what middle school courses are eligible for high school credit and what requirements those courses need to meet. We have a specific form that middle school admin fill out certifying that their courses meet these requirements. And then our middle school teachers also review with their middle school students at the end of the year what options they have as far as whether their grades will or will not appear on high school transcripts. And they send letters home informing student families as well.

start time: 203:40:50.000
end time: 220:04:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So the future administrative directive will also detail procedures for designating approved courses within pps, for recording the credits, transferring them to the student's permanent high school record. We have committed to meet again with the TAG ACT co chairs prior to the finalization of the draft ad. And then we would like to propose another revision that is not on the copy that you received in advance of this meeting. And that would be to remove number three on international transfers. Administrative Directive 4.2 0.024 already details the criteria for granting credits to students who transfer in from another country. So it probably is not necessary in this policy. Just a question about that. What. What policy is that ad connected to?

start time: 220:10:20.000
end time: 220:48:36.000
confidence: 0.98
D: I didn't.

start time: 220:50:28.000
end time: 241:44:18.000
confidence: 0.95
A: It wasn't obvious when I looked, but I think it's okay. So maybe we want to. Great. Thank you for the presentation. I have just an overarching question. It relates a little bit to that last one is because we've mixed in here a little bit what credits from middle school apply, but then also like what high school credits apply if you were in another high school. Do we have a policy generally on high school credits? The diploma policy? I'm not sure what your questions are. Well, it's just the policy is titled High school credits earned prior to ninth grade. But we have some things in here that are also talking about credits earned in a different high school.

start time: 241:45:14.000
end time: 241:55:10.000
confidence: 0.80
C: Right.

start time: 242:08:10.000
end time: 245:34:26.000
confidence: 0.97
A: What we wanted to really do, because I'm sure everybody remembers we had a case where a student was in a middle school, student took a high school.

start time: 245:35:38.000
end time: 246:26:26.000
confidence: 1.00
D: Course in their middle school in another.

start time: 246:27:38.000
end time: 256:49:10.000
confidence: 0.93
A: District and asked to transfer it into pps. It was not a course that PPS generally grants credit for in the middle school. And ultimately what we realized was that that other district had transcripted it on a high school transcript. And so we were able to treat it like any other high school transfer student. So that is partly what we were trying to clarify here. I guess one question wondering about, is it still. Should it still be titled the high school credit earned prior to ninth grade? Or is the policy. Is the policy now brought in that.

start time: 257:35:30.000
end time: 258:32:10.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Because it applies to both internal and.

start time: 258:32:50.000
end time: 259:55:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: External or not just middle school credit?

start time: 261:04:50.000
end time: 276:51:18.000
confidence: 0.96
E: The policy answers the question of can students and how can students earn high school credit before high school? And we say we have one answer for our current students and we have a slightly different answer for students who are transferring in. For our PPS students. We have a process in place. We verify that the middle school courses offered for high school credit meet the criteria and are essentially the equivalent of the high school, the same course that is offered in high schools. When it comes to transfer students, we say as long as their credits show up on an accredited high school transcript, we will recognize them as transcribed. Even if the credits they earn aren't credits that we would our own students.

start time: 276:52:14.000
end time: 277:21:40.000
confidence: 0.79
A: Can earn in middle schools.

start time: 277:36:40.000

A: Transcript that they aren't the high school student yet, how does it get on a high school transcript?

start time: 280:32:16.000
end time: 285:53:50.000
confidence: 0.96
E: It just means that their host school district determined already that those courses are equivalent. So they got it, they transcribed it. We say we trust them as an accredited institution to do their due diligence and we will recognize their credit.

start time: 286:15:30.000

start time: 288:12:02.000
end time: 288:29:46.000

E: So I have two questions.

start time: 288:30:18.000
end time: 290:38:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: The first one is what did the student engagement look like when developing this process? I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

start time: 290:50:10.000
end time: 290:57:14.000
confidence: 0.83
C: Yeah.

start time: 290:58:02.000
end time: 291:25:46.000
confidence: 0.99
E: My question was what did the student.

start time: 291:26:18.000
end time: 304:44:50.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Engagement look like when developing this policy? We did not engage with students on this. I have an answer to that, jj. Actually, the modifications to this policy are coming about because students came and testified at a board meeting, which seems like that counts as student engagement. They raised the issue of credit not being granted by PPS and what standards there were. Okay. And just to like, clarify. Well, like middle school students, you know, I know some middle school students take advanced math and Spanish during their middle school. And I was wondering, will they still be able to receive a high school credit?

start time: 305:03:50.000
end time: 305:16:50.000
confidence: 0.99
E: Yes.

start time: 305:22:30.000
end time: 314:41:26.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Okay, thank you. Eddie or Patty, do you have questions? I have another question, but I think I'm going to first just dispense with some easy work, mechanical work. The recommendation from Staff is to remove number three because it's an administrative directive. And I'm wondering if that's okay with the committee. Maybe say something that it is somewhere else.

start time: 314:42:38.000
end time: 315:01:30.000
confidence: 0.80
D: It's somewhere else.

start time: 315:29:50.000
end time: 320:49:44.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I mean, I mean say in this document. Put it somewhere else so people will know where to look and not feel like it's not taken care of. Hopefully. I'm going to address that in a minute because I don't like to have floating ads. So it should connect to something somewhere.

start time: 320:53:02.000
end time: 326:44:36.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Get it? Thanks for asking my opinion. I'm not officially part of this committee, but I'll give my opinion anyways. I think it's fine to remove it because it's not limiting anything by removing it. Right. And it can always be addressed somewhere else. So I think it's not harming anything by removing it. It just makes everything a little cleaner.

start time: 326:47:48.000
end time: 340:57:12.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Okay, so we'll remove that based on the recommendation. Going to ask staff if they can look at the ad in which that's in to see if we could actually find a policy that it would attach to so that we don't. I don't know, maybe it's the diploma. Not in this meeting, but just going forward so that I think what I would say is we endeavor to make sure that when someone looks at the policy pages that has policies and ads, they can find information. Can I say that I'm not sure what. It's hard to address the specific type. It's a logic. We're trying to make sure the reader, the person looking for information can identify it in a pretty voluminous policy and ad manual. So we're trying to. That's the objective, which I think is.

start time: 340:57:36.000
end time: 341:10:48.000
confidence: 0.97
D: In line with yours.

start time: 341:11:04.000
end time: 347:53:54.000
confidence: 0.92
A: But I don't know. It's exactly the same means of implementation necessarily and it might be. So I'm not asking to change the ad. It's just like having float. Like ads are supposed to be implementing policies generally. So somehow having it connected to some policy and I don't.

start time: 347:55:22.000
end time: 348:03:46.000
confidence: 0.86
D: I understand.

start time: 348:04:58.000
end time: 387:51:40.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Okay. I wouldn't need to do that right now. But just like that would be a cleanup. The more that we can get rid of the floaters just I think makes it. Because otherwise then people like, oh, we want you to change the ad. And no, that's not our job. That's like the staff implementation. And they're like, well, where's your policy that you're changing? So. Okay. The question I have remaining. I really appreciate the revisions. I think more clear. I also appreciate you meeting with TYGAC and listening to their concerns. The place That I feel that there's still not clarity. And I'm gonna just keep coming back to this is the statement what number is it? About the middle schools. Okay. In CB it said designated PPS Middle school courses equivalent to high school courses as determined by the superintendent or the superintendent's designee according to the following criteria are essentially eligible. Yeah, as a parent, I'm still trying to think like, so where is that? Like, where is that information? Like, where could I go find it? And certainly wanting to be able to find it, for example, before my student enrolled in a class and I'm looking for somewhere that like this is going to be on the website or if my understanding is that middle school counselors are sharing that with students. But they must what eligible courses there are. But that must be coming from somewhere here centrally. So where is that and where could a parent find that? And not like you have to get it from your student because that may or may not happen. It also raises questions. Just. Well, it's just to me it's not. It's opaque.

start time: 388:09:20.000
end time: 389:01:12.000
confidence: 0.97
D: Yeah, I think that there can be.

start time: 389:01:36.000
end time: 410:01:30.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Some improvements and we really saw that as part of the AD process. But to have some kind of notification from the district that points people to the courses available in their middle school, and we don't know that that is kind of a centralized communication that's happening at this time. So we're a system of schools. And part of the middle school redesign that we've had for a long time is to create equitable and standardized courses at our middle schools. Given the sort of decade long inequity, especially in Southeast and Northeast where you went to the K8s and there was inequitable. So through the ad process, will there be somewhere centrally the parents, the designation. Again, I'm not weighing in at all on like what should be eligible and what shouldn't be. I'm just like, how are people going to know that?

start time: 410:18:30.000
end time: 412:12:30.000
confidence: 0.97
E: We can easily add information to the middle school redesign webpage that speaks broadly.

E: What'S available and directing families to reach. To reach out to families, their student's counselor for more information. This information is definitely shared annually through the forecasting process, through slide decks, letters, home, et cetera. But we can also have a central location where families can be directed as well.

end time: 428:57:02.000
confidence: 0.96
A: I'm supportive of sending out a first reading, but I won't support a second reading unless there's. Because otherwise I think we're going to be stuck in the same place that there's more clarity on what qualifies. But it's still as a parent, I still wouldn't know, like where do I go find that information out? I think we agree with you that we need to have some more clarity on that. Are we wrong to think that that would be something that that would be.

D: Part of the ad rather than the policy?

start time: 430:41:00.000
end time: 436:44:42.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Since the board doesn't say what's in an ad. I mean, generally you could have a general reference like it'll be available on district website or however we communicate other. Or it's available on the district website. I mean, I think what you're saying is it's not currently on the website. We can put it on the website. What you're saying is it should be on the website and it needs to be on the website before the second reading.

confidence: 0.93
B: Pull it up. It's in section four. This is new language. It's really just a change to the name of it. It's a certificate of attendance. Now the old. The old nomenclature was. Please help me with that part. It's not a modified.

start time: 491:57:20.000

confidence: 0.94
B: Attendance is for students who Aren't able to complete the mandatory amount of. Of credits due to. Typically due to like long term hospitalizations and things like that. And so they are provided a certificate attesting to their limited attendance in school. There's also a requirement that's included in here that talks about the notice that we must give to students that the certificate of attendance means that they may not submit that they have graduated from a school when they are applying for jobs, etc. Because it does not constitute that they're a graduate.

start time: 505:29:10.000
end time: 509:44:20.000

A: So is number four certificate of attendance all new policy version we have hold up, doesn't have any red line changes. Again.

end time: 532:31:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So I'll just summarize it. Yeah. So for those in attendance or watching the meeting, there is new language that has been added and modified to a section called. It was called alternative certificate requirements. It's now certificate of attendance and it establishes a certificate of attendance. And the only substantive, main substantive change other than changing the name is that it now says the language did say an alternative certificate will be awarded based on a student's needs and achievement. And this now says a certificate of attendance will be awarded to students who have maintained regular full time attendance for at least four years beginning in grade nine.

start time: 533:34:40.000
end time: 535:10:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: This is a legislative change. So this is. We are just following the language of the statute.

start time: 535:30:40.000
end time: 537:18:48.000
confidence: 0.84
A: So what does that really mean? They've attended but they have not gotten credits? Have not been able to get credit.

start time: 537:20:24.000
end time: 543:54:02.000
confidence: 0.98
B: They've attended for four years, but it's been sporadic Due to the example that was given to us. This came through the special education department is major medical issues that cause a student not to be able to attend regularly enough to achieve the credits that they need to. But they have been enrolled in a.

start time: 543:54:26.000
end time: 544:11:22.000

end time: 545:47:30.000
confidence: 0.95

start time: 545:50:10.000
end time: 549:33:10.000
confidence: 0.92
A: I would say somebody who doesn't earn enough credits, it might be, oh, they dropped out. And this is like somebody has persisted.

end time: 550:42:10.000
confidence: 0.99
B: They've been enrolled for the last four years.

A: Right.

start time: 550:46:50.000
end time: 553:29:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: They haven't dropped out of school. They are, they are continuing. They continue every year in an attempt to complete the requirements. But.

start time: 554:23:40.000
end time: 563:46:00.000
confidence: 0.91
A: So this is something the legislature said school districts, in addition to providing diplomas, and here's the diploma requirements, here's a certificate of attendance that districts need to offer. Correct. So this is us incorporating that into our policy. That's b. The A certificate, another certificate of attendance. Well, that's because Saying they haven't met the diploma requirements. So they haven't met the 24 credits in the different areas, whether they've attended all four years or not.

start time: 564:28:20.000
end time: 569:24:00.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Yeah, I think that just needs to clarify because it says award to students who meet the minimum requirement for attendance or for credits and then established by a district and do not, but do not satisfy the requirements for a high school diploma. So you meet the minimum requirements, but you don't. So the minimum requirements for what?

start time: 569:43:40.000
end time: 569:59:20.000
confidence: 0.40
A: Enrollment.

start time: 570:05:00.000
end time: 571:09:40.000

A: Minimum requirements for enrollment, I think.

B: For attendance.

start time: 572:49:08.000
end time: 574:23:50.000
confidence: 0.89
C: Okay, so it should say attendance then. Because the. Then it's confusing because it says it has to meet the minimum requirements.

start time: 574:29:30.000
end time: 576:01:10.000
confidence: 0.82
A: The minimum attendance requirements. Yeah, that's true.

start time: 576:33:30.000
end time: 580:02:30.000
confidence: 0.98
B: We will change it to clarify. But I think attendance would not actually be the appropriate word because one of the reasons they're not able to complete the requirements is that there's been interruptions in their attendance.

start time: 580:12:10.000
end time: 580:43:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And so how are A and B different?

start time: 586:48:00.000
end time: 594:46:12.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, I think the issue perhaps is the A implies that students receiving certificate of attendance have met the district requirements, when in fact this is not a high school diploma. And that part may be confusing. These students are receiving a certificate of attendance verifying that they have attended school, but they're not actually receiving a high.

start time: 594:46:36.000

A: Director Brim Edwards. I just wanted to note that the red line is now in board book. Great. We're going to suggest combining A and B. So I think it would be the B and then followed by after grade nine, comma and then the button from A but clause from A but do not satisfy the requirements for a high school diploma or extended diploma. So essentially just removing that first clause. Does that work as the English teacher? Yeah. Does that work for you, Eddie? Yeah.

start time: 617:12:00.000
end time: 619:50:48.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I assume there's going to be an AD that would clarify specifically what that means, but yeah. Are we looking at A and B right now? Is that what you're asking?

start time: 619:53:44.000
end time: 631:25:28.000
confidence: 0.93
A: We're going to be removing the first clause for A and taking the second clause, but do not satisfy. And we're taking that and dropping it to be the second part of B. That makes sense. Are you all good with that? Since this is a statutory following the state statute, I'm not sure there's much more to discuss, but is there any objection to moving it out of committee for a first reading. J.J. are you okay with moving it out of committee for first reading? Yeah, but chairperm.

A: We only talking about this specific section or like the entire policy? Just that specific section. This is a conforming we made significant changes to this policy last year or the year before. So it was just to that specific one. Do you have another question or. Yeah, I did have a question regarding.

start time: 637:54:16.000

Do you want me to go into them right now or why don't you go ahead and I don't want to have it necessarily an extended discussion, but why don't you share what your questions are and we'll decide whether we need to if we have time to discuss them now or to move on. Go ahead. Yeah. Okay. So one of like the diploma requirements was like a personal financial education. The beginning of like the class of 2020. Yes, beginning of a certain class. And I know currently some schools already kind of have like a financial literacy class. So I was kind of wondering like what would be the difference between like the personal financial education and the financial.

start time: 651:42:32.000
end time: 652:25:00.000

end time: 671:36:08.000
confidence: 0.96
E: JJ that's a great question. And if there's an opportunity in the near future, within the next month, we can share more broadly what the implementation plan will be for meeting this new graduation requirement or what the proposed plan would be. In short, the state Oregon Department of Education has communicated very clearly that these new graduation requirements, personal finance and higher higher education career pathway need to be standalone courses that students complete. The only exception that they have suggested thus far is that CTE courses in finance can qualify for this personal financial education requirement and have provided us with information around how to crosswalk these two courses or this CTE course and this new graduation requirement. But we can talk more about that.

B: It just said earn the following 12 credits before between grade 9 through the completion of high school was the previous language. There's now the additional expectation that no more than six of those credits would be earned in a self contained classroom to get that's conforming with legislative language. And that's for the purpose of an extended diploma requirement.

confidence: 0.94
A: Clear to me when I was reading this about language credit and proficiency credit.

start time: 700:13:56.000
end time: 701:38:12.000
confidence: 0.91
B: How you determine that it's under. If you look under section.

start time: 701:40:36.000
end time: 702:53:20.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Well, we had a long conversation about that.

start time: 703:05:00.000
end time: 714:34:00.000
confidence: 0.95
B: If you look under the requirements under, there's a proficiency at the top of the. In section 1A, sub 2, and then under B is proficiency credit. Sub 2 talks about world Language Credit may be awarded for a language course that teaches a language other than the student's primary language. World language definition is based on the individual student's linguistic background and the standards contents covered of the course. And then section B talks about the proficiency credit.

start time: 714:53:00.000
end time: 720:11:40.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So what that means is if the student's primary language is, say, Spanish, they get credit for that. I'm sorry, if the student's first language is Spanish, they get credit for that as their language.

start time: 720:42:40.000
end time: 721:57:28.000
confidence: 0.92
B: I know there's a process. I'm going to let the educators speak to that. I'm so out of my depth.

start time: 721:59:04.000
end time: 726:21:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I'm also going to ask the last question. But whether the questions are dependent on whether we're willing to move it out. Yeah, I just want it to be clear so people know what happens because I am not clear at all.

start time: 727:18:50.000
end time: 748:59:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: So this is regarding access to linguistic inclusion. And I can share with you that in our course catalog. High school course catalog. When students are taking English Language Development Intermediate or if they're taking early Intermediate, students can't earn World Language credit. In the past, when students were taking ELD courses, English Language development courses, they were only able to earn elective credits. And that made it very hard for them to meet their graduation requirement. And it also, in a way, was framed as an deficit model rather than honoring the fact that the students were already speaking a second, had native language proficiency and were learning English as well. So students thinking early ELD can earn World language. Students who are taking advanced ELD courses can also earn language arts credit so they can earn the credit needed to fulfill those four language arts graduation requirements.

start time: 749:34:40.000
end time: 766:33:32.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Okay, that's good. I just don't quite see how anybody would understand that by reading this policy. But that's okay. We can rewrite it Policy committee because of looking at home language as an asset and then not also have so you wouldn't have somebody who say their home language was Spanish having to take French to get a world language credit. So I think in practicality, how it's now working, I do think it's working. While the language may be better, here's what I'd say. Why don't we move it out of committee and if there's something that you feel would better reflect it, that the staff agrees with, we could amend it.

start time: 766:36:36.000
end time: 768:27:20.000
confidence: 0.89
C: And the other thing, it's also written down in the student handbook, which is written a lot more clear than this.

start time: 769:33:50.000
end time: 814:47:20.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Okay, so we can move this out for first reading. All right, so the next item on our agenda is the cell phone policy. And we have had a number of discussions already throughout the summer on the cell phone policy. We have a number of our schools that are implementing. Most of our schools have some sort of cell phone policy. We have some of our high schools and middle schools at this time implementing ways in which they can sort of enforce the restrictions. Since the last time that we had a discussion about this, we have a new draft available. And essentially we have. How it's set up is as you walk through the policy, we're trying to still keep it fairly high level. So the details, high school principals are so intimidating. How we have it laid out is still trying to keep it at fairly high level policy, knowing that the administrative directives will have a lot more detail, but sort of statement of our values and then setting some high level statement of values and also setting some guardrails for schools. And I thought what we'd do today is walk through and then we have also a staff recommendation. And so what I'd like to do is walk through this maybe section by section. And looking at the time, I'm going to keep us moving along. We're not moving it out of committee this time. Get some feedback on directionally, have our questions answered by the experts and continue to move the policy forward. And I will say since we last looked at it, there's some, I would say some significant decision points that are laid out now for the, for the committee. You have summoned a panel.

start time: 815:34:20.000
end time: 816:26:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I have summoned no one. But I am very pleased that these.

start time: 816:31:40.000
end time: 891:52:30.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Really accomplished folks are here. Answer questions or. Yes, I think they're here to answer questions. I mean, I think that just to cut to the. One of the threshold questions about the scope of the policy is whether it's a singular policy that applies to the school district or whether there is discretion among schools to craft restrictions practices, use tools in their discretion for their school community and I think that's. You'll see that in the very first of the policy choices that was pulled out of this example we've been working from for the last several. So I think these are the experts to talk about that question which I think is a pretty significant question and I guess I'm going to put it a little bit finer or add an additional point which would be we set broad outlines at what point does it then become school discretionary versus like what's just that the school gets choose or the district chooses versus there may be a framework and then at a certain point the various different provisions that schools the decision whether like that's going to be a district policy or a school based one so that a little bit of refinement. So we started start at the top. So we now have a statement of values about why we're doing this. And I want to thank Director Wong for bringing this forward. We had a recently passed board resolution that spoke to students mental health and well being and creating environments in which students can be focused on academics and their student teacher relationships and peer to peer relationships. So we start with a statement of values that's new. The definition hasn't changed since last time about what a personal electronic device is. So it's much broader than just a cell phone. Include also watches and a variety of other things that electronically capable of sending and communicating information when we and same thing with the general guidelines again number two is starting with the statement that students are permitted to personally possess cell phones, tablets, pagers, watches on campus provided they are sort of off and away. We have an add in for school designated place or the place where it's not visible during normal school hours unless used for academic activities or otherwise permitted in this policy. So some of our very first policy choices here will be I guess this is a big one. Is it the school prohibiting them or the district prohibiting them. And so originally I'll just. I'll kick some kick off with a point of view originally and still the focus of the policy had been that there'd be a district wide policy so that we wouldn't have this variation classroom to classroom and school to school knowing that already schools have a whole host of restrictions and their own rules. So I'm interested in hearing why we changed that and welcome either one of you to sort of frame up initial thoughts or ask questions of. Well we started out by feeling ourselves in our in what we'd read that it would be very important to get them out of the classroom. And then we had teachers come and Ask, please, would you do a district wide policy to support us so that we don't have to be our individual monitors, that we have something to say, hey, we have to do this. So that's where I am.

start time: 892:36:10.000
end time: 922:51:50.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Yeah, I would love to hear from people who came because came all this way to speak. My issue that I'm trying to always kind of keep centered is that the data is clear. Right. And how it affects students, the experiences of teachers is clear. Right. The classroom management before and after software is night and day, completely different. I would like, you know, one of the things is also we need to solve the problem now. Would a policy fix it? Probably not. And the thing that I always want to stress is that it needs to be about support because, you know, like for example, North Clackamas did not need a new policy to, you know, try out. I think they're trying out pouches. Right. They just cited the policy of student mental health and bullying. That was the two policies that they were enforcing when going this route. You know, we don't need a new policy, but if it takes a policy to give our school support, then I'm 100% in, if that makes sense. So I think that's, that's kind of my position on that. One of the things that, you know, we have to be clear is that there's the benefits of a district wide policy is, you know, this is something that came out when I talked to Principal Wilson, if I can quote you, is that one of the fears that law schools have is if they're left out on their own to do this on their own. Right. Without district support. I don't know if any of you could help help me or just share your, share your ideas of what would work in terms of the district being able to make it work for our.

F: Okay. So Curtis Wilson, Jr. Principal at Benson Tech. So we have just implemented a new cell phone policy that started yesterday. And this was something that was brought to myself by my teachers. They're very adamant about making changes in our current cell phone policy that we've had for years but have never followed through on. It just got buried because we're just so busy. So I put together a committee of 11 adults and we met last part of June. Over the summer, we met with our student leaders and we decided that we were going to revamp our cell phone policy. And so our whole Focus is to just get the cell phones not out of the class, but not be a part of the class, because we know that that's a battle that's a little bit higher up on the pay grade for us right now. So we have a great policy that I feel is meeting the students halfway. No cell phones. Once class starts, they can use it before school, passing time, lunch and after school. But there's no cell phones in class. No cell phones are used at all for academic courses, period. If there's something that needs to be done where you need a cell phone, then we will have a meeting to talk about that. We, as a committee, decided that you can teach without the cell phones.

F: You just have to pivot and adapt to it. And so for us, I've been saturated with our parents. I send it to our students, our teachers. We spent a couple hours on it a few days ago during our pd and we have, this is going to be done tomorrow. So this is our cell phone posse that we met with the teachers and did. And this is the one that the teachers are going to present to our students tomorrow. And then our student leaders presented a PSA as well. I brought in the student body president. I brought in the senior class president. We walked them through it, and so they put together a skit that we're going to play tomorrow during sixth period for all of our students. And we felt that by moving back to the new Benson, that this was the time to make it happen, because that is a huge change for us. And we figured this is the time to strike down and make it happen.

F: They are fired up. And what I kept telling them, because they were really upset with me, was that I'm not going on an island by myself and doing this. I said, I will do this if I know that the district has my support in regards to yonder, because they wanted yonder. And I said, we're not going to yonder. A, I don't have the resources. I can't afford it. And B, it is so intense right now with our students that if the district doesn't support me, then it's me going against a thousand students and their families. And this way is much more proactive in that we're going to slowly work with the students. The ones that don't want to be a part of it, they don't want to participate in it. We're going to have conversations with them. I made it very clear to my team, no one will be disciplined in regards to a cell phone unless it comes through my office. We have so many layers that if it gets to me, then there's a serious issue. And we're going to try to support those kids who are adamant that they will not abide by these rules.

D: We at Roosevelt, we started last year with our site council and our climate team. We had teachers also saying we've got to get cell phones out of the classroom. We started with a policy that said that you could use cell phones for academic purposes. And in talking with other schools who had had that in their policy, we removed it before we rolled it out, because then it becomes this, well, what's academic and what isn't academic? And it becomes that conversation. So we went completely, almost word for word what Curtis said. So off and away during class time, we have. I have a pouch in my bag. I forgot to bring it up here. Little pouches that they're just little envelopes.

D: A kid can slide it in there. Because we talked a lot about this device is expensive and a lot of students, it's a really important thing that they own. And so we wanted to make sure to have it physically close to them if they did need a little more structure and support to not be on their device. We rolled it out today. I was in three, four classrooms. I think I saw one phone, which that was not what it was last year. So we've gone off and away. And I had this conversation with a bunch of high school students last night in my own home because one of them goes to Grant and has already figured out how to get into the yonder pouch. I've always said kids are smarter than us. So I think it's really about for me, I know our teachers really felt it was important for us as a school to have a policy so they could enforce the policy and not be the person creating and enforcing the policy. I think as a building leader, it's nice to have the district have a policy so I can be the person enforcing the policy that someone else has told me to enforce. So to me, I would appreciate a district policy because I think it allows us a little more leverage to work with kids as they figure out how to. How to move through the world not on a screen constantly.

A: So I think it's interesting that I feel like we're kind of gradating down this way. So. Elise Huggins, vice principal of Reconnection Services, closely tied to Alliance High School. We too, like Curtis, just moved into a beautiful new building. And the policy that Alliance High School is implementing this year is very much teacher discretion. So it's red card or green card, and teachers have to show a red card or green card in their room, and it's up to them. Our community is very divided over a cell phone yonder pouches or a cell phone ban.

A: And there is a commitment to wanting to teach students how to manage their cell phones, not just take them away from them, but help them build the skills that allows them to manage them in life and beyond. So that's what we're rolling out at Alliance High School. And I think there's a strong feeling of some staff that one size does not fit all. And I think this is a theme that will resonate when you have anyone from our alternative settings coming forward. Alternative means something different, and we need some, I think, flexibility to be able to design something that makes sense for those communities. So I think. Yep, I think that's the gist of it over the lines right now.

D: Thank you. Good evening. Kristin McCloskey, senior director of Schools. I just want to thank all of our district leaders and school leaders for being here tonight. And I think that what we heard from both tonight and from the last meeting that we had where we had Principal Vi Mignon and Principal McGee come to talk to the policy committee, is that there's a significant level of community engagement that has happened. And although each one of these schools has a different approach as to how they are approaching supporting teachers and students with devices, they are different approaches. And it did require a lot of engaging of the teachers and of the students and of the parents. And so I think the appreciation of supporting schools with what's going to work best for them, I think is going to be helpful because each one of them, I believe, is approaching it in the way that will work best for their communities.

start time: 1071:56:10.000

A: So I think some of the ambiguity that's been part of the discussion is what a district. There appears to be a district publisher policy coming but what is the flexibility within the policy? How uniform is it? How much discretion does it give to different schools and why? I think that's where I'm hearing the texture. So just in response, I think what I'd want to say is I think we should develop, as we do on several other things, a separate policy for alternative programs. It's just a different. I mean, they don't go often, different school hours. It's a whole different set of things. So I would just say, just generally, I don't know exactly what it is, but I think there's a different category that we should consider versus the high schools and principals. Do you have a point of view on that?

F: Well, yeah, I was going to say that we've had the off and away for years. Posters are all over the building, right? They're everywhere. It's in our Benson Tech Policy Compact handbook. And when we put together the cell phone committee, and I was very specific about who was going to be on that committee because I wanted to hear from all sorts of people. So we had sped teachers on there. We had true anti cell phone teachers on there. We had teachers that were like, we need to like, really work hard to support our kids because they need their phones. I wanted to hear those views as well. And so then we went back and forth and back and forth. But one of the things that we did land on is that we've always had a policy at Benson. We've just never enforced it. We just never enforced it. I mean, I dug it up, I looked at it, I compared that to what we're doing right now. And it's almost word for word. So we just kind of dusted it off. And what I needed my staff to know was that administration is going to support you now. We are. It's now at the top of what we're doing. Kind of like everything that's kind of happening, it kind of just lit that fire. But so many other things just pushes the cell phones down because we just allowed our teachers to figure it out themselves on their own class per class. So my staff feels good that they don't have to have a power struggle with students now. They're going to send them to us and we're going to come get them. And we, my office will now have those conversations. They can just keep teaching. So if we go with the district policy, for me, as the principal. It's about when I have that student or parent that's going to push back pretty hard and they're going to go above me in regards to the policy that I have the support as well because I have no problem dictating our policies. But our parents are very good about. Okay, well everyone has a boss and we now want to go to the next level. And if it's in writing then I can feel very good about what we're doing right now. We don't have it and so it usually just stops in my office.

A: So based on presentation I'm going to summarize and then also take from my visit to Franklin and Cleveland yesterday and this morning conversations. There is the commonality. And this is again putting the alternative programs with a different set of rules. But the commonality is off and away. Right. And so Cleveland has yonder pouches, Franklin has the wall, not pouches. I guess you have envelopes. You have.

Like what are the commonalities and then where is there divergent because of how schools operate. I'm a little bit surprised about maybe this goes into the next piece that no use for academics. And that kind of surprises me because that seems like sort of a given. So. Oh, given that like there would be instances in which teachers would say they should be able to use their phone for academics.

F: The Chromebooks came up a lot when we were having this conversation when people on the cell phone committee at Benson were pushing back about not having cell phones being used for academic purposes. So every argument that came up we were able to solve it with either laptops, Chromebooks. And in the end we felt good that they could still learn by using their Chromebooks or their laptop and not their cell phones.

F: And that was the great thing. Today is a lot of our students first day. Everyone's there now all night or nine through 12. And as they're trying to find their classes, because it's between classes, they all had their cell phones out and they're looking for their classes through a student view. We had no problem with that. Then once they got into their classrooms, they put their cell phones away.

start time: 1189:06:40.000
end time: 1231:33:50.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah, one, one quick thing that. Thanks for the input. That's really helpful because one of the things that I think is important is to make sure that the policy is open enough to allow for creative solutions. And what I mean by that is like, for example, and I'm not here, I'm not trying to promote yonder, but the thing about yonder, that is good, right. That we see. Right. Is that the problem? Right. We should be solving for problems. Right. So like, the problem is the burden of enforcement of cell phones off in a way has been on the teachers. And that just has shown to. I mean, we've been doing this for 10 years or more and it's just not working. It's a huge stressor. Right. And the problem it solved is that it moved the point of enforcement from the classroom to the front door. When they walk in, they put it in, they lock it up. And now the enforcement aspect is no longer in the class classroom. And I think that solves a problem. Now, is that the best way? Probably not. I mean, we're probably going to. I mean, we're humans, we come up with cool, creative ways and maybe two years from now there's going to be another like solution that's even better. Right. And so I think it's important that we have a policy that A, gives our school support so that the principals are not left alone to deal with this on their own, but B is open enough that when new solutions come about, it's easy to adopt. You know, whether that's in the ad or, or by school, by school. Right. But they, they do need support. And I think that's, that's where I think I want to kind of channel what Director Scott said in the last meeting. It's like, you know, make. Maybe the better way was to compartmentalize and solve for specific problems. Like, for example, alternate vet has. Has different issues that needs a different set of rules. Right. And our general ed high schools have a whole different, you know, it's a whole different ball game. Our middle schools is a different thing as well. So perhaps we just need to solve for things. And how, I think the discussion just needs to be on what kind of supports that people need and how, how to best solve that problem directly. Right. So I think in terms of this, I think this new policy here that we have, the redline version is completely different. Right. The question now is how is, what problems is this one solving for and is it the right way to go?

start time: 1231:42:50.000
end time: 1240:22:20.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Yes. Can I just ask one? Because I fear what's going to happen is we're going to go back and be asked to redraft and looking for their voices to help us bridge what you ask while they're here and you are talking to each other. When you say you want a policy, it would help you to have it in writing. What do you need that policy to say in terms of a district statement versus discretion at a school level versus not saying perhaps just to kind of get to follow up on what use in groups?

D: So I'll speak a little bit to the academic activities because I said something about that. So an example of a disagreement on what an academic activity is. So we have teachers who, especially after the pandemic, have given kids brain breaks. And so I'll be sitting in a classroom, they'll give a five or ten minute brain break and kids are completely silent, not talking to each other, all on their phones. I don't, mental health wise, I don't think that's the best thing. But I think that a teacher or a parent could argue that that 10 minute brain break is really important for their mental health. Right. So I think that when, as you're starting to look at what do we consider an academic activity? I mean, when I think of academic activity, you're doing a kahoot, you're, you're using the QR code, you're doing the, you know, you're checking for understanding by doing some sort of quiz.

D: Using their phone for. But they can do all of that on their Chromebook, which they should be bringing to class every day. So I think that when we get squishy, that's where it gets hard and up for interpretation. And so that was the feedback I got from my colleagues. I went to the middle schools who had already had cell phone policies in place and asked them what was in their policy. And they are the ones that said they took using the phone for academic activities out because that's where the rub came. Right. So if I'm struggling with enforcing the, I can say, oh, it's, this is for academic purposes. Right. As opposed to just a hard and fast. We just don't have phones on in class. We had the. We called it tech away. Tech. Ok. And it was a green sign and a red sign and those sat up with tech away on people's front boards and kids were on their phones. So I think like, what's the consistency? I think that's the part that for me, as a leader would be helpful.

And I have, my friend's husband says that it's going to be like smoking in 20 years. We're going to look back and be like, why in the world do we let these kids on their phones all day? So I think there's a lot of education and I think kids know it. But I think then there's also the students that do need some of these things to help them. We have a kid who's diabetic and he has to access his phone. Right. So like there are places where it makes sense to make exceptions. And that's what we do all day long. Right. We make exceptions.

A: Okay. So I'm just going to summarize what I've heard so far. That it would be helpful to at least have a high level district policy that supports schools and that we probably need to have something different for all alternative programs. And we would welcome thoughts on the alternative programs, what that might look like. It seems like the way that things are worded that the one thing that Safe B would be in conflict, for example, with what's happening at Benson is that during passing time, students can use. And lunchtime can use. No, I'm sorry, during passing time, which this says only before, after school and lunchtime. So that would be stricter than what you have.

start time: 1312:19:00.000

confidence: 0.94
A: Okay. And Cleveland is no lunchtime or anything because they have like yonder pouches that are not going of Open them all up at lunchtime. But similar to Franklin. So what I'm trying to do is I find where's the sort of the floor? Set the floor and then with the based on a theory of schools could set something stricter but that there's a floor that you all could operate under that like it's the same at this school as it is at that school. And the most basic floor is often away during class. During class time. I think we're at a separate time. I think we need to do maybe this is getting more insights from the academic side is a little bit deeper dive on the academic piece. And actually because we're not going to implement something right away we're going to be able to hear back from you about whether that actually works or like hey it turns out in art it's really useful because they don't have their Chromebooks out and sometimes the students might want to use it. So maybe we'll hear more from you on that academic piece. I want to keep going on these and I want to talk a little bit about 2C which is the videos originally and just for everybody's purposes while this is redlined and changed. It's not changed until the committee decides it's changed. Originally there was no videos shall be taken during school hours unless the direction of adult for educational purposes the policy now says or a recommendation from staff is no videos or photos of any kind on school grounds using personal cell phones or electronic devices. If such videos or photos are used to harass or bully another student or violates PPS student anti harassment teenager finals policy. And since we have some experts here do you have thoughts on these Because I can see some other examples where that we would want to add here if we went to a much narrower this is a very significant narrowing but I could see like you know some students don't want to be photographed and it video that doesn't take this into account here. It's just saying if you photograph them and then use it to harass them or bully them, you can't do it. But some people don't want for a variety of reasons their photo to be taken. So that'd be one thing and then maybe a question for staff. If somebody takes a video or photo of somebody and uses it to mock that student with other students but doesn't actually share it with them is that or maybe they don't even know about it is that say the individual doesn't even know that it's happening. Is it bullying if you don't know it's happening. Yes.

A: Yeah. Why don't we say they can't take photos, so maybe we can. I just want to remind us this is not the usual path to policy drafting that we. This started as an example. We brought examples to the committee and then we added it on top of the example document. That's why we tried to pull out the policy decisions. So I want. There's nothing here that's trying to usurp the policy making authority of the board. And it's been an unusual process. And Julie and I have had this conversation. We disagree about how the rule worked. I think it's made it harder.

F: That would be. Petey and I were just talking about it. So when school was out today, a lot of students were in the main hallway. They were excited about being at Benson. And they all gathered and they were all doing their thing and then someone said it there and then they're all doing their dance. And I just kind of know it was exciting and great. Same thing at lunch. They were with all their friends. They were all excited. They were all taking group photos. So to say that they couldn't take photos or videos would be. Especially if we're allowing them to use their cell phones before lunch and after school. It would be very difficult to enforce that because like example for us, when we had all 1000 kids come down for lunch, it was just like a concert. Right. And kids were everywhere. And that would be logistically impossible to enforce for us with the five people that were in the cafeteria with a thousand kids and they were all excited to see each other and phones were everywhere.

start time: 1405:32:40.000
end time: 1413:15:40.000
confidence: 0.96
B: And we don't need that addition. I mean, it's referencing another two other policies that we already have in place. We have in the past when people have created videos or taking photos to harass or bully, we have taken. The schools have taken action even without this specific language in place. It's just because those other policies talk directly about the action of bullying. Or harassing.

start time: 1413:26:40.000
end time: 1424:34:24.000
confidence: 0.94
C: So I get my question about that is also just, I mean, when the bare minimum be like not allowed to take any photos or video of any kind that's going to be posted on online or public forum. Because I just think of analogies. Like, for example, we already have rules that prevent random strangers coming to our schools and taking pictures for our students. Right. I mean, then, you know, it's a fuzzy line between students taking pictures and then posting it on Instagram. I mean, it's practically kind of the same thing. So I think the point is, like, where do we draw that line? That A is enforceable, but it's also, you know, still needs to follow our rules and protecting our students.

start time: 1424:35:52.000
end time: 1432:33:36.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Right. I think we're going to have to get some really specific guidance on how to enforce that. Because there could be people consenting to a picture and four in the back not knowing their being as though it was taken. That the administration would have the ability to investigate individual phones or personal social media sites. I mean, just to think realistically about how you would accept that and what the guidelines would be, we would need some input from people on the ground about what's achievable.

D: I'm just thinking about sporting events, right? Sporting events, theater events, these things that are happening. Because if you're talking about on school grounds, you know, kids at the basketball game taking pictures and that type of thing, I think this would be a really. Yeah. I mean, I know that we have definitely done discipline for students who have used things in a harassing or bullying way. So, Mary, I agree with you. This kind of references something else that we're already doing.

start time: 1439:44:08.000
end time: 1445:56:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: So I don't know. I don't know if this is needed. I wonder if it could be instead of a hard and fast rule, but to just state that not everybody wants their picture taken and distributed on social media. I mean, sometimes it's very culturally specific. So I'm wondering if instead of just saying no, doing it, but just making a statement of values.

start time: 1446:38:10.000
end time: 1451:57:14.000
confidence: 0.94
D: And I think that's where education comes in. Right? How are we teaching kids to be good stewards of technology and social media, and how are we teaching them to use it responsibly? Like that to me is kind of the other side of this coin. Right. We need a policy, but we also need to educate students on how do.

F: And when we do our investigations, it's pretty. We've been doing this a long time. It's pretty obvious to us what the intent was. In regards to whatever meme or language is attached to the picture. And if the language is in there about cyberbullying, harassment, etc, etc, we're in to tie those two together. As compared to. I took a selfie with my friends. They were in the background. They didn't want to be a part of it. They're now saying that they're being bullied. Okay, then we'll look into it and we'll see if we can incorporate that.

F: And we counted yesterday with our 330, 13 freshmen that showed up when we had them on the learning walk. We purposely were looking for cell phones because as freshmen it shouldn't even be an issue. And we only counted one. There was one student that we had a conversation with out of the 300 that were sitting up there that was on their cell phone in the morning when we were going over everything and taking our class pictures. So we were very happy about that. So the freshman got it.

A: How happy they can be without it, we might not have to talk about it so much. Okay, thank you so much. That'll be really cognizant of the time here. So just I'm going to summarize on this piece that I. What I heard is that these two policies may be enough. And if you had a policy of student being able to use before or after lunchtime, it'd be very difficult to enforce that. No photo and videography.

end time: 1526:31:30.000
confidence: 0.91
A: So you could just add. Or the student code conduct is your reference policies. Okay. So we have a number of other provisions that we didn't yet get to, although I think we got to some of the major ones maybe to expedite and also to not have super appreciate all the feedback here but I guess one of the things that might be useful is just to ask the schools what they're. How they would at least the high schools because I think that's where the focus should be right now whether this language, the revised language on if advice is found the thinking of the high schools and the workability because I know there's already a lot of conversations happening so it may be useful to hear. I hesitate to ask about specific language when the language came from just a discussion document of the policy decision of proposing hasn't been so this language is just. I want to make sure we're asking what you are contemplating not necessarily what happened with the LAUSD policy.

A: Yeah I was just wondering if staff could share with me all of like the PBS high school's phone policies. Looking at Chief Rank do you have policies for each high school as it relates to cell phones? So that would be useful. So I'm just looking at the other policy choices but like what to do if suits are found. Seems like less of a conversation with students but more a sort of administrator and staff discussion about how that would work. So I'm concerned about in a policy us saying how it might work. Do you think you need in the policy direction of what happens if a student violates the policy? Is that normally the policy if they violate it and they continue to use it this whole like confiscating the phone.

start time: 1550:06:10.000
end time: 1562:52:02.000
confidence: 0.96
D: I mean, I mean we have a way that we're dealing with it and we did put it in our policy just to be transparent. And part of the reason that we wanted to be really clear on how we're doing collecting cell phones or not collecting cell phones is so that we can track because we want them to enter In a stage 1 referral office referral so that we can track it and see if we're is Curtis on his phone every single period and every single teacher is taking it from him for the period. But we aren't. We're not seeing that across the day unless we track it centrally. And so our policy is you get a couple warnings. I mean it's clear how many warnings you get. And then the teacher takes it for the rest of the period. And if the student refuses then we take it at the office level for.

D: And then I think then we go into, you know, it's every day that this is happening we've got to have a different intervention. So I don't know that that needs to be in the policy because I think also It's. It's just like the student, you know, does. Can it. Can it refer back to the students Rights and Responsibilities handbook? Because that's where we go when we deal with discipline.

F: Yeah, we're in the same boat in that we have a lot of proactive measures so that we're trying to reteach the students how to utilize their cell phones. So same thing. First warning, we drop the pouch, put it in your phone. Put your phone in the pouch, you leave it next to you. Keep teaching, you pull your phone out. Second time, teacher gets it, gets the pouch to us, and they can. Each room in Benson has a locking file cabinet where they can store the phone. Sometime throughout the day, the phone comes to us. We call the student down, we have a conversation. The student gets the phone back at the end of the day, but we have the conversation. But we also are tracking it. Now we have a tracking system as well, spreadsheet. If it happens a second time, student comes down, we have the phone. And now we're calling the parents, because now the parents need to be involved with this, because now we're having the parents come get the phone. And we know a lot of parents do not want to come up to the school to pick up the phone. So we're hoping that that will be like a proactive way to curb this in regards to the phones. But at the same time, we're having these conversations with the students each time. Each time, I feel very good that the conversations will work with our students. I don't see going to a level where a student is going home over a cell phone. It's really just being proactive and having the discussions with the kids. And so it will fall under Insupport Nation, which is in the Student Rights and Responsibilities handbook. But we will also do a lot of practice measures before we get anywhere near there.

F: That's a great question. So I knew. This is Curtis Wilson from Bizatech. I knew that if I don't have my student leaders on board, then it's us against them mentality. So I brought them in in June. My incoming student body president, my incoming senior class president, and then some ASB leaders. And I explained to them what we were about to do and I wanted to get their input. And once I explained the why, we have a big why. Mental health, etcetera, etcetera. Etc. Data research. And they were like, we agree. I was like, okay, now we're going to need your help. So they were the ones that came in August, met with us, we rehashed everything again, and then they announced it to the seniors yesterday. When the seniors showed up, we didn't. As admin. We wanted the students to do it. So students did it. We were standing next to them, but our vice principal talked about it, our senior leaders talked about it, and. And now tomorrow, the entire school will see the video that was put in place by our student leaders about our new cell phone box. And it's just a skit, two minute skit about they're just acting what would happen and why we're doing this. And they're giving, which is important. They're giving the why. That's what we wanted to have happen.

So we went out to our Latino family nights, we went to our Pacific Islander nights, our African family nights. And there were some differences in what families felt they needed as far as access to their students during the day, which is why we decided not to go cell phone free all day long, that there are times like that kids do need access to their phone to communicate with family, to do the things that they need to do. So we wanted to make sure that there was a little flexibility while also keeping class time cell phone free. And students, like I said, they weren't psyched about it, but they also understood the why. Once we really talked about what it was and why we felt like we.

And so you had a policy at one campus and you didn't have a policy at another campus. And so we're, I think, maybe a year or whatever behind, folks, and just trying to lay a policy down and follow through with it with the green and red cards and bring the staff together and gather some data and some student input. So I think we're probably a few steps behind some of the comprehensive high schools and also just dealing with the work that comes with bringing two faculty.

A: So that's where we're at in terms of student input. JJ okay, I'm looking at the hour, so I'm going to say we've got the topic wrapped up for now. We're going to come back with another set of revisions. And I really appreciate you bringing your expertise and your insights from your schools. And I think given we have time. And just as a reminder, everybody, Dr. Adams is going to be working with student leaders in this committee on a student survey. So we'll have additional information. He's also going to do some focus groups with the schools that have enforcement mechanisms. So we'll have plenty of data. And that I think is targeted for October 15th thereabouts, to get that data back on the students. And we'll incorporate that in. I think we're going to actually have a better policy by going slow, to go fast without we gotta get a policy in place and then, you know, trying to figure out all the things that we need to change because we hadn't thought about it beforehand. So really appreciate you sharing at least your initial experiences. I think it will help us create a better, better policy. And jj, thanks for bringing student voice. And hopefully that will also be amplified as we move ahead. So with that, I'm going to turn. We have, I just want one other item. We have two policies out right now for a thank you very much. Let us know how. We want to know all about the learnings that you secure. It was a really rich conversation. Thanks for arranging that. So we have two policies out for first readings and I want to note that one of the policies that we had a first reading on field trips, foreign travel and other off campus activities. There was a discussion at the board, we had the first reading about this policy and there is a staff had a recommendation that was I'd say more restrictive than the first reading. And there is an interest by some individuals on the board who are not committee members of advancing an amendment that would incorporate the staff Recommendation which is a 5 day with a plus 2 days for travel that is extensive and that has been posted and I want to flag it in committee because generally our practice has been to not be amending policies on the day that we're approving them at the full board level. And so what I'd like to do is send out a version of the policy board, this specific amendment to the full board and at the next board meeting just flag that for the other board member so that we can hopefully have a discussion here in the committee but with more of the board members as part of that discussion. So the staff, right. I mean listening to the discussion the other night I heard and then afterwards a desire from some non committee members to amend it. And I generally, I think it's bad policy to have like the second reading and then have it amended. And then if we amended it, we then have another, we need to have another first reading. We should. And then another 21 days. So what I would like to do is ask to bring back to have a board discussion to just get a sense of the board. And so because I do feel like if there is a desire to change it, we should give people an opportunity to comment on the change. Hopefully we won't vote on it.

C: But I think the issue I have with that, I got two big issues, is that this has been worked on for months and months and months. So like, you know, when do we pull the plug and just say hey, you had your chance, right? And then the other thing is that you know, in terms of governance. So like the thing about management, right, and this is the biggest qualm I have is that the whole purpose of this policy was kind of fixing something that is endangering a program. You know, for example, I mean I'll just back up a little bit. So I, you know, there's oversimplifying but you know, two styles of management, right? One is like, you know, there's, there's a concern happening, right? You and these trips are happening. And so okay, well you know, you need 10 days. But let's, let's work on that and try to figure out, you know, you know, here's some problems we're working worried about students left behind. So let's solve that problem. And then, you know, we work with the groups to try to reduce their amount of days over. And then there's the other style of kind of management which is saying like, oh, here's a problem. You got five, you know, now it's five days cap. Work with it. And so that, you know, that's more of an authoritarian type of thing. And the problem with that style is that it doesn't take into account the effects that has on these programs, right? So, for example, it's not collaborative at all, right? And so if we're going to amend it and say, okay, let's go with staff recommendation, which is let's keep it at five days with two additional days for extended travel, it still is kind of like saying, this is the limit. You figure out how to work with it. And the thing is, the feedback we've been getting is threefold. One is that this makes it very difficult for this program to continue. I mean, let's just be straightforward and honest. This is a program that has been created and maintained by the Asian communities for over, you know, for multiple decades. And to have suddenly a AD come in and limit to five days, we are now threatening the continuation the existence of these programs. So I just want to be very clear because in order to keep these things going, these groups have very outright situation that the current limits they have right now is unsustainable and has been very clear. So I guess my point is that if we're going to start limiting days, right? Then I guess that's my beef right there is that these kind of things shouldn't be. Obviously we're working backwards, right? We're saying, oh, these are the days you have, and then go figure it out instead of the other way around, which is let's work with these groups and figure out what's the maximum or what's the minimum amount of days they need, and then let's work with them to try to figure out a calendar where they can, you know, reduce the amount of days they're gone, right? And then it's a collaborative thing. So I just. I guess that's my beef. It's like going with another. Further limiting it again is a wrong way to go about. The reason I push this policy to do 10 days is kind of because the ad wasn't changing, right? And then it also puts in wording that says these groups will work to try to minimize the days that they're gone. They don't. That doesn't mean they have to take 10 days of school days. Maybe there's some years they can reduce it to eight or seven. But it gives them that option instead of a hard fast rule where if they can't meet it, you know, then the program goes insolvent. So it I think my again, I'm not in this community anymore, so this is up to you. But that's my big beef with it. I would not prefer the amendment route.

A: As somebody who just spent six years on a policy or more, I feel your pain. I also would say that so there's a risk of like you've had your chance in that ultimately the policy could just be rejected by the board. And I guess then you have the existing policy and ad that exists and you. I feel very strongly that say if it comes to the full board and the amendment gets offered, which I expect it would is to me it's the substantive change and would require another 21 days. So it and I think that's important because I think actually if it would change from what the committee originally recommended to the new the staff recommendation that we'd want the community to be able to comment versus just voting for like we're going to amend it and now we're going to adopt the policy. So you. One of the things I'm trying to consolidate the timeline because if you don't, if you don't consolidate the timeline, then we wait till we're at the 21 days, we bring it to the board, somebody offers the amendment that we, you know, know that it's going to be offered and if it gets adopted then you have another 21 days. So it takes longer. So in some ways I'm trying to also respect the committee process but also. Which is where the majority of the work should happen. But also recognizing that the full board will vote on it and it could be amended. So you're suggesting accept the amendment that we have to put 21 days. I'm suggesting that at the next board meeting we have an agenda item, we get a sense of whether there's support for the amendment. If there is, I would say that we should adopt it in and post that for 21 days so the community members can share their point of view on the amendment. And if they're at the next meeting, if there's not a majority that wants to include the amendment, then we move ahead with the second reading. So right after the amendment was well, I don't think we're done with the 21 days by the next meeting.

C: Right. So option. That's option one. So option two would be we go forth as planned, and if someone proposes amendment and let's say it passes, then. Then because it's such a significant change, it would have to go back. Right. But if it doesn't pass, then the policy. We can vote on the policy right there. Right. So I guess my failing to see what the advantage is of.

A: Well, I guess I'm flagging that. I think I heard a majority of the board express some concern. So trying to, as we discussed, sort of condense the timeline. And the policy says that the. Whether it's a material change is to the discretion of the board gets to decide that. I mean, I would say it absolutely is a material change, but again, it's a sense of the. We could, as a committee, Patty and I could say we would also share that we think it's a material change. Like the committee would feel that that sort of change is a material change. It should go out for another first reading. And again, that is up to the rest of the board to whether they agree with that or not. There's only been one time in seven years that they just. It was a material change, and they just went ahead anyway and they said it wasn't a material change. We're just gonna adopt the policy. I'm thinking of the best trying to get it past the way it is, so. And that sounds kind of scary. Well, I think it's that, you know, making the case to the board. I mean, we were all present for the discussion. There were a number of questions raised, so. So if somebody brings up the amendment, we have to vote on whether it's the amendment. Yep. And then assuming the board agrees that it's a substantial adjustment, then we'd have put it out for another 21 days of comment.

C: I guess my question is, what's the advantage of doing the way the first way you proposed, besides just getting a read of the board?

A: Sometimes it's good to know where the chess pieces are, I guess. And we can't. Since somebody has requested an amendment, we can't ignore that. Well, I mean, every board member has a right to offer an amendment.

C: I guess the concern I have about that is the potential delay it could cause because school's starting. School in Taiwan has started in Japan, and they need time to figure out when they're doing their residencies and if we're delaying it for months, that could be devastating. I'm just saying that I think in terms of timeline, I think we need to figure out what is fair to these programs and our teachers.

A: We generally have a 21 day comment period. Say if it's amended, I do think it's a possibility. You could ask for the waiving of a 21 day comment period and have a 10 day comment period. Since we've already had a 21 day, there's no flexibility. But this is why we need to have our first and second readings at all meetings. Just because it slows the process down if we don't do it. I mean, obviously if there's no, if there's no, the amendment's not accepted, you have a second reading and then it's done. But if it's a, if it's amended, then you, unless you don't want to have an additional public comment period.

C: But you know, if the amendment votes down, then we go up with a straight vote. If it votes up, then we would have to go back to first, second meeting.

A: Also, I guess the other value of having this discussion and having it posted is it's not going to be a surprise to the community. And, and I would suggest that I would ask that we have a posting of the amendment if it's going to be offered along with the meeting materials. Because otherwise we're sitting at the dais and people are wondering what the amendment is if it hasn't been posted with the materials. It also gives people an opportunity prepared to comment that night. People can sign up to, people could sign up to comment on the amendment.

start time: 1973:50:26.000

C: So are you asking me to ask the person who might be proposing an amendment to post?

start time: 1975:38:50.000
end time: 1979:12:50.000
confidence: 0.97
A: I think if they're going to offer it, if it's going to be offered, it's good practice to post it and also it allows people to come comment on it. That's what I meant.

start time: 1979:54:30.000
end time: 1981:10:06.000

C: Okay. Do you know who's going to be offering an amendment?

start time: 1981:11:58.000
end time: 1989:57:40.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Well, that amendment came from Director Hollins. Okay. And again, I just think it's not great practice for, for us to be talking about an amendment sometimes if we haven't posted it. So if we know it in advance, again, trying to speed up the timeline and also give people an opportunity to comment on it if they want to because anything the board votes on we have I think three public comments, three comment slots. Okay. In addition to the underlying second reading if we get there.

start time: 1990:22:40.000
end time: 1990:34:22.000

C: Okay.

A: So we had some really good comments from a staff perspective. Is there anything on that topic?

start time: 1994:42:50.000

confidence: 0.83
C: Yeah, if I.

A: Well I think you talked through the examples in the policy and policies lists the examples I do think there's if the board just if the amendment works adopted by a majority of the board there's an option for the board to vote it in that night if their timing is concerned. So it is listed in the policy. But generally when there's a substantive event it starts another 21 day period. But the board has discretion to do that. Thank you. So make sure to when we get that posted for the second reading. I'll check with Director Hollands about whether he wants he intends to offer it because I think best practices we should just is it the same one that's been in these materials. So the last item and we're not going to go deep on it but I just want to flag it for future reference is a potential change to our the way that we elect board members. Currently we elect board members. You are you have to run from one of the seven zones and then you're elected by city wide or school district wide. And we have the option to do it by just by zone. So to elect them just by zone which as other jurisdictions across the city are moving towards more like district representation. Partly also to make it manageable from a running for office standpoint that looking at doing potentially switching to that. So that'll be on future agendas as we move ahead. And I think we'll have some clear we have to get the elections office would also need to work with us in order to implement it. So we'll have more information on implementation and what the elections office could do if we were to if we wanted to move ahead. Anything else Director Burn Rivers. I'm sorry, I didn't hear whether we were adjourned or not. Okay, thank you.
