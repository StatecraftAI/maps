A: All right, all right, all right. Let's get him a big old hand. Yeah. All right. I wanted to say this public, I'm reading off of a script. So for those of you that don't know, I don't like to read from scripts, but I'm gonna make sure that I get this right. So we have a script to keep us in line. With that being said, this public meeting of the board of education for January 9, 2024 is called to order. All items being considered for this evening are posted on the PPS website under the boarding meetings tabs. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will rep will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check your district website for replay times again. Good evening and welcome everyone. For those of you who might be tuning in, we, fortunately for you, for us anyway, have been fortunate to enjoy the performance by the Franklin Jazz Quartet. Can we give it up for them one more time? Being a lover of jazz, hearing them back there, I was like, okay, okay, okay. Somebody been out there doing they thing. And my guy in the back, he was, I'm feeling you, bro. I'm feeling you. So thank you, thank you, thank you. Let's see. We will have another opportunity to enjoy one more number, but before then, I just want to share a few reminders. In order to ensure the safety, please keep the walkways and the aisles clear. We also ask that you please be considerate to those around you and keep any signs below chin level. With that being said, superintendent, would you please introduce our guest this evening? Well, I think you named it Director Green. We're so fortunate to have tonight here the Franklin Jazz quarter. I want to give kudos to their instructor, Mr. Jason Owens. He's not able to join us here this evening, but I would love to invite up our district leader for visual and performing arts, Kristen Brayson, if she's here to say a couple words and introduce a next number that we're going to have the fortune to hear. Thank you so much, Superintendent Guerrero. Members of the board, I'm excited to present the Franklin Jazz Quartet tonight. Unfortunately, I'm standing in for their band director who is double booked, if that's any, you know, evidence of our band director's commitment to what they're doing out there in the world. And so the best people to represent tonight are the students. So we're gonna have a student representative step forward and talk about what they're going to play. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. Before introducing the combo. I have a short thing to read here. Every last one of us. The goal of the Portland Public Schools Master Arts Education Plan is to increase equitable access to high quality arts education for all students. Every last one of us. The heart of Portland is in the arts. And we, the dancers, actors and visual artists, carry that heartbeat. As we share art with you, we are developing our unique voices and perspectives. Thank you for your attention for continuing to support high quality arts education for all of us. Every last one of us. With that, I'd like to introduce our combo. On drums is Alejandro Mikame Gonzalez. On bass, we have Athan Searcy. On guitar is Aviv Ross. And my name is Paul Zoupon. Thank you for having us. We have one more song for you tonight. Please enjoy Indian Lady. All right. That was absolutely amazing. Thank you. One more time to that amazing Franklin Jazz Quartet. I feel like we should start all our meetings like this because that was. That's how you start a meeting right there. Okay, let's get going. I appreciate y'all so much. In May of 2021, the board adopted a process by which board members could be considered for board leadership positions. The resolution states that in order to be considered for a leadership position, board members must notify the board manager in writing by December 1st if it is their plan to run for board leadership in the January election. At the last meeting in December, both Chair Hollins and myself indicated that we would like to continue our roles as the chair and vice chair, respectively. There were no other submissions with that time. With that being said, I'd like to have a resolution to consider the election of Director Gary Hollins as the board chairperson. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt resolution 6824, election of the board chairperson. So moved. Seconded. All right, I need to write that down. Director DePass moves and Director Brent Edwards second. Is there any board discussion? Okay. Hearing? None. Let's see. Ms. Bradshaw, is there any public comment? No. The board will now vote on 6824, election of a board chairperson. If this resolution passes, then what that means is Director Hollins will remain the board chair until the new chairperson is elected in July. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. Opposed? Let's see. Student Director Silverstein, please indicate your vote. Yes. Are there any abstentions? No. Resolution 6824 is approved by a vote of 7 0, with Student Director Silverstein unofficially voting yes. Excellent. Thank you. I believe we actually have Director Hollins here with us. Would you like to say something to the people? No, I appreciate that. Next, we have a resolution to consider the election of myself, Director Herman Green, as the board vice chair. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt resolution 6825, election of the board vice chairperson. So moved. Second, Brim, Edwards, and Scott, is there any board discussion? Ms. Bradshaw, is there any public comment? No. The board will now vote on 6825, election of a board vice president, vice chairperson. If this resolution passes, then I will remain the board vice chair until the new vice chairperson is elected in July. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All opposed, say no. Student Director Silverstein, please indicate your vote. Yes. Excellent. Are there any abstentions? No, there's not, because everybody voted already. Resolution 6825 is approved by a vote of 7 to 0, with Student Director Silverstein unofficially voting yes. Excellent. I'd like to say thank you all. I will continue to do the best that I can, and I continue to give everybody the permission to tell me when I'm off and when I need to, how I need to do better. So, again, thank you. Let's see now we will have the student report. Student Director Silverstein, would you like to present your report? Thank you. So a little less scripted than usual, but, you know, we're getting into the heart of winter, and I've been discussing with a lot of my peers, and one thing that I've been hearing a lot about is how people are struggling with mental health. So I just wanted to take the time to talk a little bit about that and say that I see you and I definitely empathize with your struggles. It's something that I've also had to work on, and I wanted to offer a couple of resources and remind people that there are always people there for them and that they're not alone. Safe, Oregon is a great tip line if you're concerned about someone else. And then there's also youth line, which you can text teen to teen to the number 839863. And that will give you someone, usually a teen, to talk to. So I also want to say thank you to the school psychologists and everyone else who are helping to make school supportive places. And then also a big thank you to the students who are doing the work to discuss these topics and destigmatize mental health issues. That is very, very important. And we see your work. And then, of course, as always, there is a lot going on in the district, but I wanted to acknowledge a couple of issues that students have been communicating to me about because I get a lot of emails and I apologize I'm not able to respond to most of them. But I have been seeing the emails about the dual language immersion residency lengths and then also the discussions about the standardization of English curriculum and the impacts this will have on choice English classes. So thank you for using your voices. This is exactly what we should be doing and I know that's a heavy burden to bear, but it's amazing that you all are doing that and I can't wait to see where your voices bring you in the future. And I also want to say that I've been bringing these issues to the district student council and we are discussing them and figuring out the best way to move forward. So finally, I want to continue something I've been doing some past times highlighting student initiatives and art performances. Jefferson Winter Dance Recital is happening on January 18th at 7pm and then Franklin's winter dance performance is happening January 19th and 20th at 7pm so please attend if you can. Student arts performances are really, really important and we need your support to continue them. Thank you. Student Director Silverstein continues to amaze me and remind me that she's so much smarter than I am. Thank you so much for everything that you're doing. Next up, we're going to have student comment. Ms. Bradshaw, do we have any students signed up? We do. Okay. Julia Vogel, Chloe Gilmore, Sarah Fike, Frankie Castle as they're making their way to the front, let's give them a big hand as they're making their way up. I want to review our guidelines for public comment. First, the board would like to thank you for taking the time to attend this meeting and providing your comments. Public input informs and improves our work and we look forward to hearing your thoughts and your reflections. Our board office may want to follow up on board related issues raised during the public testimony, and we request that any complaints about individual employees be directed to the Superintendent's office as a personnel matter. If you have additional materials or items you would like to provide to the board or the Superintendent, we ask that you email them to public comment all1wordps.net that's public commentps.net and please make sure that when you begin your comments that you clearly state your name and spell your last name. You will have three minutes to speak. You will hear a sound after three minutes, which means you will have 30 seconds to wrap up your comments. And I want to say this because I don't know that I'm going to say it again There's a lot on the plate tonight. I'm not talking to y'all because I generally let kids do a little bit more than I let adults do because y'all look better than they do. Y'all smarter than we are. So I let y'all go longer, a little bit, not too much. But I want us to keep in mind that we got a long night ahead of us. So it's going to be 3 minutes and 30 seconds. The buzzer will go off at 3 minutes and then at 30 seconds. Please hear my heart. I am not being rude to you when I actually start talking into the mic saying, okay, your time is up. It's time to move on. That is not me being rude. That is being as nice as I possibly can to say, time is up. Let's move on to the next one. Okay, we're all good. Thank you. And with that being said, let's get it. Do you have to press the button to speak? Yeah, if the button. If it's not green, it's not on. Oh, okay. It's. I think it's on. My name is Sarah Fike, last name F A I K. Okay. So Chloe and I are a part of a movement called the Green New Deal for Public Schools. And it is a movement, part of the Sunrise national movement, which is an environmental justice organization. I just want to start off talking about what the Green New Deal for Schools is and kind of give some brief overview of it. So it is a federal bill that was reintroduced to Congress this past fall by Representative Jamal Bowman and Senator Ed Markey. And this bill is going to invest $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years to provide healthy green upgrades to Every K through 12 public school in the nation, while comprehensively addressing environmental and racial inequity. This legislation would also create 1.3 million good paying jobs annually and reduce carbon emissions by 78 million metric tons each year. That's as much as taking 17 million gas powered cars off the road. So that is the federal bill side of it. This is also a resolution that is passed at local districts around the school. And they're also working on developing a state bill so that each state can pass it. The point in having resolutions passed at the district is to kind of create momentum for the federal Congress to be able to pass such a bill because it is such a big ask with a lot of funding. So if we kind of show our government that we have a lot of districts around the country that are in support of this, it gives the green light for the Federal legislators. So again, this is an interconnected network of thousands of students. There's over 100 hubs around the country doing the same thing that we are it's champions for climate crisis solutions. And we know that in Portland and specifically for PBS we've had the ccrp. But as Chloe and I have done like some research and talked with those who have written it, we know that like a lot of it still hasn't been implemented yet. So this is kind of a new initiative to help with the implementation of that and bring in some new aspects. So the five main demands of the Green New Deal for schools are to have safe and clean buildings, which kind of aligns with the PAT demands which, which just had a contract that just passed. The next thing is to have free and healthy lunches for all public school students. Some examples of schools that do this are the Chicago Public School District. And then the next demand is to have pathways to green jobs. So to have schools offer opportunities to connect students with meaningful and good paying union jobs combating the climate crisis. We know college is not the direction for everybody. The next one is climate curriculum. So for students to be taught a comprehensive climate justice curriculum in schools. And then the last demand is climate disaster plans when those disasters strike. That is all. Thank you. Hello. Thank you so much for this opportunity. My name is Chloe Gilmore. My last name is spelled G I L M O R E. I am a senior at Lincoln High School along with Sarah. And I'm here to talk a little bit more about the Green New Deal for Schools resolution and our campaign here in Portland along with what we hope to accomplish. But I'd like to start off by mainly focusing on one of the demands that I care most about, which is climate justice curriculum. So I don't think that the climate justice curriculum side of the CCRP is comprehensive enough. And I also don't think it's been implemented in the ways we want it to. I would like to see comprehensive climate justice curriculum incorporated throughout all PPS high schools, not just one unit in science class. And I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to take the environmental justice elective class at Lincoln taught by Tim Swinehart. And this was really, really influential to me. And I take what I've learned in that class and that has completely changed the way that I view the world. So this class is only, this is one of only a few climate justice classes taught throughout the district. And I think it needs to start at younger ages as well. And not only should climate justice classes be available, but we need more teachers to incorporate social and racial justice topics into the classroom. Many students who I talk to have little knowledge about how their lives are impacted directly by climate change and pollution, what they can do to take action, and how interconnected environmental issues are with systemic racism, from heat waves to wildfires and unpredictable weather patterns such as snowstorms. Students are affected too, and I think that they need to know about the ways that they can take action. So we appreciate the steps that the school board has taken in regards to the ccrp, but we have yet to see a lot of the components implemented and we hope that you listen to what us students have to say in the coming months as we will continue to give testimony and we will send our finalized resolution to the school board in March. So this is just the beginning and you have the opportunity to pave the way for other school districts across the country to pass a Green New Deal for schools. So I hope you take this opportunity. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Frankie Castle. K A S S E L L Konban watashi no mae wa mori hiran kidesu I am an 8th grader at Mount Tabor Middle School in the Japanese Dual Language Immersion Program. I have been studying Japanese for nearly 10 years. My mother is half Japanese and connecting to my family and culture is very meaningful to me. I am grateful to participate in a program that is preparing me to become an informed global citizen. Planning for the Japan Research Residency has been part of our daily curriculum since September. We are expected to conduct the majority of planning and I am both currently part of the Itinerary Ministry which is responsible for understanding both itineraries, creating a slide presentation for parents, and facilitating the Q and A. I have actually been preparing for this year since kindergarten, watching my older brothers become bilingual, conduct research in another country and return to present their findings. I attended their Omiyage Banashis or Souvenir Stories, the capstone event where students research is presented, and was inspired as a young student to work hard towards this moment. I am confused and disheartened by the district's refusal to support this important part of our education. The letter dated 122223 says that field trips must be scheduled to not miss more than five instructional days. This is not a field trip, but an international academic experience tied to the course curriculum. The Research residency is core curriculum and we are not missing instructional days. We are attending classes, navigating, interviewing, collecting data, utilizing advanced writing and math skills, and all in Japanese. Upon our return, we present our research to the community. The JRR not only develops fluency, but develops leadership, global awareness and is aligned with the PPS graduate portrait. This feels essential as I head to high school in the fall. The parent group leaders and trip directors for the Asian DLI programs have reached out to the PPS administration multiple times in the last seven months. Our communities are frustrated at the lack of communication and engagement. I ask that you advocate for us and urge the administration to approve the research residencies as they have existed annually since 1997. Please don't let us lose this critical part of our education. Thank you for your time in allowing our teachers to present this evening. Thank you so much for your comments. Are there any other. Is there any other student comment? Miss, Is Julia Vogel here? Okay, then. No, that's everybody. Okay again, thank you. Thank you, thank you. I told y'all they were smarter than us. All right. In 2019, following a complaint brought on by a parent which raised concerns about the impacts to students in a school in a school community, when a large cohort of students leaves for several days, the school board made a change to the to one of the policies. 6.5 0.010 P field trips and foreign travel and other off campus activities. The policy language was revised to require that plans for student travel be communicated to the school community and implemented to minimize disruption in the curriculum or programming for students remaining on campus. The criteria for approval are in an administrative directive for principals and their supervisors to review and approve on request for trips. Our role as a board as board members is to review the trips that come to the board for approval based on the policy and the administrative directive that is in place. With that being said, Superintendent Gorilla, would you like to add anything that I missed out in my notes? Thank you. Vice Chair Green, it might be important to talk about a few details, particularly because this is a topic there was a lot of extensive conversation about in years past and many of the board members seated here were part of that discussion and appreciate the advocacy coming from our DLI school communities. And so it is an important topic and we fully recognize the important value that these residency trips play as a capstone. So for background, the Board did have extensive conversation on these issues related to the DLI residency trip starting in March 2019 was the last time there was really a robust conversation and seems to come up annually sometimes. This resulted in an update to the policy which you mentioned. There were a number of key concerns, but the concerns and issues that were raised by board members in particular in the past was a worry about a continuity of instruction back on campus for non participating students, particularly when instructors and administrators in most cases are participating in these residency trips. So there was a concern about the length of the absence and and the continuity or the disruption on campus and a desire to try to keep those within five school days or to try to schedule those or calendar those when school is not in session. We understand that also on the other side, their calendar may not always agree with that. That was one of the concerns. It was to try to minimize that adverse impact to make sure that the school community had a plan for how to address lessons, for example. So again, the issue was not the educational value of the trip or the trip length per se, but when these trips were being scheduled and the impact on students when that travel is occurring. Last year, schools in some cases were granted an exception and provided another year's notice regarding this past practice that it should try to shift to be mindful of the academic calendar as captured in the policy and the related ads when making their travel plans. So I understand some of our teachers are here this evening to share with you their perspective on the value of this experience for students. I've heard those presentations. They're wonderful. And as I've mentioned, there's no disagreement on the merit of the trips. As I've said before, I would only hope that all of our students have a capstone experience in their 8th grade year. I'll pause there because there'll likely be questions and we do have numerous staff who are prepared to get into some of the details if the board would like to do so. Okay, is Matt here? Matt, would you like to come up and share your presentation? We have five people we're used to standing up. I think we're up there. It Good evening. And I want to start by thanking the board and Superintendent Guerrero for having us here this evening. I have to say after hearing the intro from the superintendent and also from Vice Chair Green that I'm not quite sure we prepared in the way that to answer, I think to respond to I think the concerns that came out in 2019 and I didn't tell my colleagues here that who are sharing this mic with tonight that I might shift. But I want to I guess I'll do some of what we were going to do and I do want to, if there's an opportunity at the end to come back to respond to some of the concerns that were brought up in 2019 and how we've addressed those in the last year and continue intend to continue to address those this year. So bear with me a little bit. We are here as Frankie so eloquently put out there. We're here to ask for you to grant approval for these research residencies, these Asian DLI research residencies. And I would like to put out there that this is an ask for the future, that we have this conversation repeatedly. As somebody who has done these research residencies for 20 years, it's hard to keep coming back and feeling like you're having to fight for something that we feel like has a been well established as something that is deeply powerful, that is deeply connected to the graduate portrait. We have worked hard to be inclusive, to be a part of that equity plan in this district. And I think that it's hard for me personally to stand up here or sit up here again and have to make the same argument again that I made in 2018. I can't quite remember when it was to address that parent's concerns. Yeah, as Frankie said, this isn't a trip. We are not tourists and this is school. And as I tell my students, this is school on steroids. It is school from the moment you get up. And I'm equating school with this thing called learning because school is not within the four walls, in particular with the context in which we teach, with the subject matter that we teach. You can't walk out of the school and find that context. So this is enormously valuable. And in a program that is K12 having this kind of moment where a culminating experience that pulls, that brings great rigor, great relevance, great realness. My colleagues, I brought a couple of. Well, all of us are not going to speak, but I'm going to turn it over to one of our students. 2006 participant in the Japan Research residency. He his name is Yuki Sakai, but he now goes by Sakai Sensei at Mount Tabor Middle School. Good evening board and thank you again for the opportunity to address you directly. These are three photos of me. The first on the left is when I was in 8th grade in Japan meeting my host family and I would like to start there. Chairman Hollins, last meeting you asked one of my former students what he who went on the research residency, what he thought the benefit was and if it's alright, I'd like to also answer that from the perspective of having done it 18 years ago. So again, to echo school on steroids, Never in my 12 years in PPS did I feel that rigor was so closely tied to meaning as when I wanted to look cool for my host brothers when they fed me. I wanted to speak Japanese like I've never wanted to before. But I also wanted to share you an anecdote from around the same time that that photo was taken. My grandmother in Japan called me and she asked me if I was ashamed of being Japanese. And I had no idea what she was talking about. Let me repeat that. I had no idea that being biracial was a stigma because I was in this context of my schools where they taught me my culture, my language, they put me in the context, they pushed me in my language. And so to this day, even as an adult where that feels different, I always have that foundation from my youth. Later on, going back to the rigor, this second photo is of me graduating from University of Hawaii. But what you don't see in this photo is that I did not take Japanese during high school. So the, oh, Mr. Bacon, Brennus is probably behind this camera somewhere in the same room. So the point being that his class was the last class that I took in Japanese in school, but I was able to test into, walk onto campus and test into 300 level advanced conversational Japanese. So that's not for nothing. There's some real world benefit. And that's. That's credits. That's college credits. And then last is me on the right here. This was taken last year on our research residency. This is Kansei Gakuin, an international school in Osaka, where it's come full circle. I'm helping one of my students, former students, perform one of her 50 surveys to collect data. And so I hope that answers some of the questions, not just zooming in, but zooming out 18 years later, what this can look like. And with that, I'd also like to pass the microphone to my colleague, Kojo Hakam Laoshi. I'm Kojo Hakam. I've been teaching in the Mandarin immersion program since I arrived in Portland in 2007 and been leading the research residencies since 2007, 2008 year. So it is my baby. Before I get into what's on the slide with data, I want to talk a bit about the reasons. The reason why schools from around the country and immersion programs from around the country have come to Portland over the years to learn from us on how we've developed these research residencies. The reason why students in their 12th grade, both in Japanese and Chinese immersion programs, when they reflect back on their 12 years of immersion, always come back to the research residencies as the single most impactful event in their 12 years in PPS. And that is because these experiences are transformational. Let me repeat, these experiences are Transformational. If you look at the data, this was our very first year with our residency to China, and we decided to do a pre and post assessment language assessment on our students. And prior to departing our students, we did not have any student reach benchmarks on that assessment, and we only had a handful reach benchmarks in writing. After just two weeks, we had 60% of those students reach benchmarks and surpass and 60% over 60% in writing. And this is phenomenal because normally students cannot. You cannot reach that significant of a change in one year in a language classroom. It's very difficult to do. But looking at data by itself does not tell a whole story. So I want to add a story behind this. And this is about Ben Di Valley, one of our. It was our first year student. Sorry, a student on our first research residency. He came in to middle school as a struggling student because his father had unexpectedly passed away. He struggled in the classroom, he struggled with his peers. But when eighth grade came around, he decided to focus because he knew there was this opportunity to go to China. And by the time the trip came around, he was not only flying high, but he was selected to be the interpreter for Principal Kevin Bacon. Some of you may know him. And he came back a changed person. He left a boy, he came back a young man. And by 12th grade, he decided to continue with his Chinese. And he applied for and got into the U of O Chinese flagship program and ended up four years later, getting in to even a more prestigious the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Nanjing, where he was rubbing shoulders with future diplomats and leaders from around the world. Now, this is just one story because literally every student who went through the program has their own story to tell. And this is why the research residency is not a trip. Thank you. Do you want us to speak or. No, we're. Okay. I was just. I didn't want to cut anyone off. No, we're there. Okay. I. I think we can all agree, I believe we all agree that this. This experience is more. Is more than just a trip. I think that. I don't believe that's in question. What is in question is the amount of time that it's going to take to. That it's going to take to do this, the impact that that is going to have, and possibly when would be the best time to actually do that so that we can lessen the time. The administrative directive that is in place is there. And I believe that the. For now, at least for this trip, that administrative directive is in place where we change it At I believe is going to is probably in the student Success Committee. It could be sent to the student Success committee or it could be sent to policy or. But it's not gonna. I don't believe that it's here. And so I believe what we need to do is unless I'm hearing something different, we need to pass this to the for future, for future experiences. We need to pass this to the student Success Committee to stay on top of so that we can figure out a space and a time. There are a lot of other places. There's Memorial Day weekend, there's April, there's three day weekends. There's a lot of different places where we could look to try to find something. And I believe the path forward is going to be to look to see what we can do for future trips. Chair Green please. You're not now, you're chair today. So I think it's a good idea to send it to the Student Success committee. And having been on the board when the policy was changed and also when the original complaint was filed, I would ask that the committee really take a deeper look. And I think as been noted already tonight, there's not a any sort of I think question about the value of the trip to students. In fact, based on some of these discussions, the board also created an equity fund so that other students had whose school communities wouldn't have, who don't have the resources to travel or don't have the parent fundraising that there would be opportunities for other students to travel. Knowing how important as was mentioned tonight, that the sort of experiential learning away from the classroom or outside the classroom, how important that is, that other students haven't had an opportunity to do that. But I would ask in the committee to really focus on two issues. One, that the complaint really was not focused on the trip. The complaint was around the students who remained at the school and the either lack of instruction or the holding instruction until the other students came back, teachers, the principal being out of the building. So I would ask to take a look at that because I think that was at the root of the issue not whether this was an important trip. And then the second issue that I think is worth looking at is I did think that staff said that they would approve the trip if it were coincided, if it met the requirements of not more than five days out. And so I think as we're looking at it, we since the board approves any trip over 150 miles or any sort of travel and I think it's important that we're not getting to like whether it's a field trip or travel. It's like the board approves things over 150 miles. It doesn't matter what it's characterized. It could be a sports tournament, it could be a band competition, but board approves it. We approve a lot of travel that happens during spring break. And so the. We already have that occurring. And so I think it's worth for the committee exploring sort of what are the barriers to that happening, whether it's cost. So I know one of the issues that's been raised has been the cost of traveling during spring break. We currently have lots of other student groups doing that. So is it because they plan for an advance? But we look at some of these other like in a problem solving mode and looking at what the issue, the reason why the policy went into place and how we can problem solve through it. It's not. And again, I think looking at the students who were left behind and what the basis of that complaint was and I think that is a committee is a great forum to do it versus in the board meeting where we don't really have dialogue back and back and forth. Thank you. I appreciate your comments and I appreciate the advocacy on behalf of the community that's come out. We've heard, we've gotten letters from lots of different school communities. And I agree that this conversation needs to happen in a committee setting. We should question whether the original complaint still stands. Are we still solving for the kids that are left behind? And if we are then, or if we are then how do we do this? Aligning the timing of the trip. And also that my hope that we would do this in consultation with DLI communities. I know that's already assumed, but we would want to hear from or we wouldn't want to have input from the building leaders and community members that are that are impacted by this. I'm a big fan of experiential learning myself. I went, I graduated from MLC and I know that this is a very important trip and want to make sure that we address all the equity issues that we're present in that original complaint. Can I add something? Yeah, I was going to. Is that okay? Yeah. If you could answer some of those questions I know you had. Yeah. I think I have grave concern about the way that policy was developed in 2019. For one, I. We weren't ever in the Our nor parents nor teachers were invited into that conversation. It was based on my understanding one complaint. I don't know what the data was. There was no Data presented to us as to the impact. I don't know any of those details. In response to that, regardless of whether it's true or not, we don't want to have that impact, that negative impact on those students that don't go. We have done extensive work to make sure that curriculum does continue, that it continues for all students. I talked to my colleagues, several of which said, yeah, actually, it was an incredible opportunity to focus in on students, a much smaller group, and impact their learning positively. So I'm not quite sure how that policy was developed when there wasn't any invitation that I know of to us, to the parent groups. And so to have that be the basis for this decision really feels, for lack of a better word, wrong. I think the other thing that I find troubling, and I mean this with all due respect, I know you. You all do an amazing amount of work for our district, unpaid. We were not invited. Despite asking to be at the table with the PPS leadership. We were not invited. We were not. Multiple times we were ignored. I had an email out multiple times to a particular assistant superintendent who didn't respond for three months. And it only. I only got a response after we, in red shirts collectively came to the door knocking. And that may have been. I don't know. I don't even know how it happened. But only then did we get the conversation. And how is it that we had that last year? A real poor process, a really poor process. It was absolutely not inclusive. And then we're here again, and you're making a decision to pass it on. And with all due respect, you're making a decision. What I'm hearing is generating is a decision to pass this on to the student Success committee. I have no idea what that group is. And we still have not been invited to the table. This was not hard. We actually had a meeting scheduled. You can tell I'm passionate about this. We had. We had. We had. We had a meeting scheduled, Chairperson Green, in June, at the end of June, last second, canceled by administrators. We asked again in August, multiple times. That would have been the appropriate time for a conversation. That would have been an opportunity to dig in here. I so appreciate that you see the value in this. We know it deeply. Our community knows it deeply. And to then say, oh, we're just going to push this off to a committee feels makes me angry. It makes me angry. And I don't know where to go with this, but I absolutely feel like it was a failure on the part of administrators in this district to not have this conversation until we came to you at the board meeting, we couldn't get a meeting. I got the in between the go betweens who came and met with me, met with Kojo, met with Yuki. But we never once got a meeting with the people who actually made the decision and wrote the letter to this community to say no, we're keeping it to five days. We gave endless explanations about why this doesn't work, why it is we do more than five days. I think it's best to go back to Kyomi. She spoke to you all in December. You gotta go slow on these things. You can't just do it in five days. It has to sink in. I have a question, but I know our student representative also did, so I want to let her go first. I didn't have a question. I just wanted to add a little perspective. So I went to Mount Tabor, but I was never in the immersion program. So I was one of those students like at the school when my peers went away. And I think from my perspective that instruction continued. And obviously that might not be the same across the district. But I do think there was an effort to do that. And for me, it never felt like I was losing anything by my peers gaining something. I think I just felt really happy. Yeah. I guess just the thought that remains in my mind from that many years ago is just that I was really happy for them. And at least at Mount Tabor, there was a really big effort to make sure we were still getting high quality instruction during that time. Thank you. Yeah, I'll be quick and I'll start with what my colleagues have said. The value of this trip is not in question for me. I think anyone who has done a study abroad program, anyone who's seen that transformative impact. My own kids didn't do a DLI research residency, but they had went to a program that did field studies for five days. Those were transformational. I can only imagine what a 10 day trip is. I want to see you get a 10 day trip. I will, since you. I know we want to move on. I will say though, I think what I am confused about is that I know we have other programs that schedule 10 day trips and only miss five days of school. And I think what I haven't gotten in the hundreds of emails in the. And thank you everyone for sending them. They're very helpful. About the value of the trip. What I haven't heard is why this trip can't be scheduled similar to others, so that we can still have 10 days but only miss 5 days of school. I would love it if you could answer that. Chair, Chair Green. I would just suggest that since we're going to try and move this committee. Director Wong is the committee chair and he's already indicated that he's open to having the meeting. And believe me, you will. The community will be invited to that meeting. I also want to just state that in 2019 there was very active engagement with the superintendent and the Yanukai and the other parents groups around. So it wasn't that it happened in a vacuum. So how the policy works is those are all public meetings. I know the superintendent met. Now the administrative directive is written by staff following the policy. But there was a lot of engagement at the time around the policy. So I just want to make sure the people in the room is like it wasn't done without engagement with the community. And we do have a formal complaint process that's open to everyone and in the community. And when we have a complaint we follow our process. And this policy came out of a response to a complaint. But there was active engagement. So that was news to me. Before, before we get into the back and forth of the response and because I said it, I'm going to allow you to have a final response. But before we do that, I also see that Chair Hollins hand is up. I also want to say one more thing really quick. I'm really sorry about the late notification about putting the committee. That was actually literally something we discussed last night. So the idea is that I lead the student success committee. Just full disclosure, my kids in the microphone MIP program. I'm Taiwanese American. So you are going into some place that's chaired by a very biased person. Just so you know. So the idea is that we do have these problems. There's. There's problems that the district is having with, with these trips and then there's problems. I. I want to acknowledge that there's problems scheduling over spring break because you don't ever get a spring break or prices are higher or maybe the programs abroad are not. The calendars don't coincide. So we acknowledge a lot of these problems that you're facing. So the idea is that this kind of format is not really good to problem solve. It's just really horrible situation. So putting in a student success committee means that you and anybody you want to bring and we'll also have the district leaders there who are part of. Who are the ones who write the letter, who are the ones who have to manage these things. Also they're in the same room that we can work together to actually problem solve and come with a solution so we don't have to keep doing this over and over again every year. So that was kind of the thinking behind that. And I was hoping to also talk to you about that and see if that's something that could work out for you. Can I have that last word? Not yet. Chair Hollins, he's virtual. I just wanted to get the answer to Director Scott's question. Fantastic. Then that gives my guy Matt the final word. Okay, let's go. Well, not the final. Because I'm gonna say something afterwards because I want to make sure that we're all crystal clear on the aspects of right now. But go. The question was about timing. Right. Why not five days? I think. Why not ten days with only missing five days of school? Correct. I think we're saying the same thing. I probably misspoke. I apologize. Mr. Wang referenced. If you start putting it into a spring break or a summer break. Spring break doesn't work specifically for the Japanese program because that's when their school year ends. So there is no school. We don't go to school, so we can't tie it into spring break. There is issues around making this financially accessible. Prices do go up. It is also a professional thing. If you start asking your teachers to go every year. And this is an academic program, it's deeply embedded in our curriculum. That's not sustainable. You can't be giving up a spring break every single year. It is not a special one time off trip to Europe for the band or whatever. This is something that happens every year. It's a part of what we do. The summer doesn't work. And the reason is because part of what I think is a powerful design of the research residency is it doesn't just happen for two weeks. It happens long prior to departure. As Frankie spoke, she's on the itinerary committee or ministry and is a part of designing the plan, the itinerary, etc. Etc. If you. And then the. The culminating piece is actually coming back and asking students to digest, to analyze their results of this, their research in country, and present that bilingually to their audience and to talk about their transformations. We call it omiyage banashi. It's souvenir stories. You can't do that if you do it in the summer. It's just, all right, see ya. I don't know if you would get the transformations if you didn't have that processing piece in it. And it is absolutely one of the most powerful things to be a part of as a parent, as a teacher, as a student. When those students stand up and put a connected story together about their experiences and share about their findings. So the argument is both, that's an argument for length as well as not doing it during a spring break. I'm sorry, I need to say one more thing. You sound like a preacher. This is your fifth close. Okay. So I guess my concern is that if you pass this on to the Student Success Committee that what you are doing, and I may have this wrong, but what I think I'm here understanding is you're thinking about not this year, but next year. You're not wrong. What? You're not wrong. I'm not wrong. You're not. So here's what we're looking at. And this is the unfortunate part about sitting at this table at this time, sitting behind this desk right now and being the one in this seat to have to deliver the news that I'm going to have to deliver and that is this last year, for whatever the reasons as to why it didn't come together, why the meetings didn't happen and that didn't happen, I wasn't there. And so I don't know what your communication look like or who was. What I do know is that we have an administrative directive in place that says five days. And I know that what you're asking right now is to go beyond that five days. The reason that I suggested kicking it to the Student Success Committee was not to simply kick a can down the road because that's not what I'm. What I'm looking to do. I understand that by kicking it to the Student Success Committee that I have Director Wong over there who is as much interested in figuring out a solution to this as you are and that he, like a hound with a bone, is going to figure out a way, solution based for us to come up with something that works for everybody involved. But you're right. You're absolutely right. That is futuristic talk. As of right now, what I would suggest is that you look to figure out how you can get your tickets for the next, for the, for the five day trip so that we can get them as soon as possible at the cheapest price possible so that you can bring it back to the board. Because right now at the current policy, the way that things are, the board, what we will get to do is to approve your trip once it comes to us, under five days or five days and under. And then we can approve that and then we can, we can get it going and then from, from the fury of this and the outrage and the mad cries, then you go, you go in, y'all will come up solution based and not just simply saying, I want what I want, I want what I want, I want what I want. Because that's not going to get us anywhere. So we'll figure out what we can do, working together collectively to come up with something that works for everybody involved so that we can get 10 days, find out where they're at. Then Director Wong can get a motion from his committee to send it back to the board for board approval and then we can look at something. But that, the long and short of it, I mean, that's the hard brass tax. Nobody wants to hear it, Nobody really wants to say it, but that is what it is at this point. The trip as it stands, were you to take it would need to be. Would be five days, what you did last year. And I don't want to get into this back and forth because I got a lot of things on the agenda that I have to get through tonight. But what we said last year was we were making an exception to the rule and that you would need to work together to come up with something because we would not be making an exception to the rule the following year. We said that last year. We said it as plain as day. And now we're back and what you're asking is to say make another exception. Well, I said we did that last year. And I'm telling you that you're going to get, as of right now, you can make the five days. Thank you. And now I need to move on to the next agenda item. Unless somebody else has something to say. Thank you. But you're not even at the. The dais, so thank you. Thank you all so very much. Thank you. Thank you again. Thank you all again. All right, thank you all. Thank you all. And now I need to move on. All right, we need to move on to the resolution 6812. Superintendent. Superintendent. Girl, can you please introduce this next item? Always do. Year, for years we've been asking, been asking to have this conversation. You're on the wrong path. You're all on the wrong path. Do the math. Superintendent, can we please introduce the. The next it. I'd like to bring up our Deputy Superintendent myung Lee and Mr. Dan Miley from Talbot, Harvala and Warwick, who are going to speak about our annual comprehensive financial report. Thank you, Superintendent. Good evening. Terry, can you please turn up the mic so that I can make sure that we can hear in the midst of all the hustle and bustle. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Chair Green. Good evening Directors Myung Lee, Interim Deputy Superintendent of Policy, excuse me, of Business and Operations. And I'm going to turn the mic over in a moment to Mr. Dan Miley from TKW to present a summary of the year end financial closing process or the acfir. And just to share for all of the directors, this topic was discussed at some length at the December 19th meeting of the Audit Committee. So thank you members of the of that committee who engaged in that discussion. There are a number of materials that are posted on board book and with that I'll turn it over to Mr. Miley to present his and his firm's work. Good evening. I'm Dan Miley, a partner with Talbot Cola and Warwick, also known as tkw. A little bit easier to say. We are the District's independent external auditor. Today, as was mentioned, I'll be presenting this at a fairly high level. But as we went over in depth with the audit committee, you've now had some time with the materials, the reports, our letter. If you have any questions that aren't addressed, please feel free to ask. But other than that, I'll keep it at a fairly high summary. To kick off, I'm happy to report the District got a clean unmodified opinion on its financial statements. So that's a testament to the to the accounting and finance staff of the District. During the year the District did implement one new accounting standard that involved subscription based information technology arrangements. Simply put, it took the your IT agreements underneath the scope of the of the new standard and put a subscription asset, an intangible right to use. It's now included in capital assets and a subscription liability. That's pretty much the major difference other than just the normal annual activity in the financial statements this year. I'm also happy to report that the District had no Oregon Minimum Standards findings. So we test certain things that the state asked us to do and we had no compliance findings there. We did identify one internal control deficiency during our audit. It was a material weakness involving revenue recognition. I do like to clarify that this did not involve cash missing or anything else like that. It was simply how the transaction was recorded. Some contributing factors was the complexity of the transactions because there's two of them that we identified that the District did correct. And then also accounting staff turnover. Some of these transactions were started by one accounting staff. They left the district and another one came in. So there was something missed there. And then also a lack of communication between departments within the district led to some confusion. Confusion. But I'm also happy to. To notify you that the district's management. And it's in front of you, I think in the board packet tonight, has put together a corrective action plan, a plan of action on how to address this finding. For the single audit over the district's federal expenditures. There were four major programs this year. So four federal award award program programs were audited with. And we had a clean opinion, an unmodified opinion on the district's compliance with. With those four programs. So no audit findings there. So overall a pretty good audit there was. Other than the control deficiency which the district's management appears to have in the process of addressing. I do want to thank Tracy and the rest of the accounting and finance staff. These are not small documents. As you can see. It takes a lot of work. And then to have a number of auditors come and ask you questions and ask for hundreds of documents over the course of months pulls on their time. So we do appreciate that and we want to say thank you. While we do work for. For you, the board, we have to work closely with management, and they help us complete the audit by providing us all the information we asked for. So I do want to thank them. And then if you have any questions. Is there any questions from the board? So I just wanted to raise one issue. Well, first of all, I want to state the district finances have been much discussed this year. So it's good to have, I think, the audit on the book. So with a lot of transparency, people can see what our finances look like and have been independently reviewed by independent auditors. So I think that's important note, and I'm appreciative of that. There were. There was one finding that addressed two issues, and we had an explanatory note from staff regarding the finding. And I thought it was really well written and explained finding. And then what corrective action has been taken. And I would just ask that it be paired with the audit in the materials that are posted this evening and be inserted in just the record of the board meeting, because I think it does a good job explaining the two different pieces that were raised relating to revenue transactions. And there's perfectly good explanation for what happened. And the. The district staff has addressed it. So I would just ask that that be. We have one whole package that addresses that together. Excellent. Actually, I did that out of order, so I apologize. Can I get a motion and a second to adopt resolution 6813, acceptance of the annual comprehensive financial report? The Reports to management and report on requirements for federal rewards. 6813 is what's on my mind. I think the script is in air. It's one, two. So moved. Second. All right. So moved by Scott and seconded by Brim Edwards. Now, is there any other board discussion? I would just like to ask for the background information around the findings that staff provided be included as part of the record and posted online so that everybody has the benefit of seeing staff's response to the finding. And I would echo all of Director Brim Edwards comments. Okay, quickly, Ms. Bradshaw, are there. Are there any public comments on this? No. Okay. The board will. Let's see. Board will now vote on resolution 6, 81 2, acceptance of the annual comprehensive financial Report, reports to management and the report on requirements for federal awards. By voting yes, we are acknowledging we have heard and received the results of the annual comprehensive financial report. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. All opposed, indicate by saying no. And Student Director Silverstein, please indicate your vote. Yes. Excellent. Resolution 6812 is approved by a vote of 7, 20 with student representative, Student Director Silverstein unofficially voting yes. All right, thank you so much. You said. I thought we were done. You got something? If I. If I can just comment really, really briefly. Vice Chair Green first to Director Brim Edwards. Question and request about posting that explanatory memo. It appears that is now posted. So thank you, Kara or Roseanne, whoever got that done. Thank you so much for doing that in real time here. And I want to give credit for the drafting of that memo. Largely goes to Tracy Pinder, who could not be here tonight, but we thank her for leading this effort as she does each year. And we're sending her very good thoughts. And we have online Claire Hertz, who everybody knows, and Kristen Johnson. They both played a big role, as well as Ms. Hertz's business associate, Angie Peterman, who was extremely helpful in this whole undertaking. We want to thank the, the accounting team, the general ledger team, the grants team, Many, many staff who really did a lot of work as Mr. Miley mentioned, like the Grammy Awards. We want to thank everybody. Give honor to God. Play the music. I'll stop talking. Play the music. Just wanted to say thanks to all. We all got it ahead of time. Look at it. Thank you. Thank you. Next, we will consider the resolution to approve the first amendment to the fiscal year budget. Now, because we had a staff presentation and discussion at the last meeting, I believe that interim Deputy Superintendent Ley is going to briefly share a few highlights on the proposed budget. Before we get a motion on the table, let's see. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt resolution? This one is 6813. Resolution 6813, amendment number one to the fiscal year 2324 budget for school district number one, J, Multnomah County, Oregon. So moved. Second. Second. So Brent Edwards and Scott have motioned and Brim Edwards motion. Second was by Scott. Ms. Bradshaw, wait. Is there any board discussion hearing? None. Ms. Bradshaw, is there any public comment? No. Excellent. The board will now vote on 6813amendment number one to the fiscal year 2324 budget for school district number one, J, Multnomah county of Oregon. If you vote yes, then you are making changes to the previously adopted budget for this year. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All opposed? Student director Silverstein, please indicate your vote. Yes. Excellent. Resolution 6813 is approved by a vote of 7 to 0 with Student Director Silverstein unofficially voting yes. Excellent. Thank you so much. All right, next we're voting on two. Well, now we're into the policy revision, so thank you. I told you we can get through this. I got faith in y'all. Don't tell me. Don't talk too much. Don't talk too much. You'll mess me all up and I'll start preaching. Yeah, wait, I get to go next. See, that's why I was trying to make up time early. Next, we're voting on two revised policies. One new policy and one policy rescission. Director Brim Edwards, chair of the policy committee, provided us with background information when the board did a first reading. And I'd like her like to ask her now if there's any other information that she would like to share before we move forward with voting yes. This is when you go yes. Okay. And I'll try and go quickly. So I also want to be clear because I just know that sometimes our policy process isn't always clear. So we've. Our first reading is when something gets introduced. Our second reading is actually when we adopt it. The first policy we're having. Rescinding a policy. It's the strategic plan policy. It's essentially a plan that was from 2005. We have a new strategic plan. A strategic plan shouldn't be in the policy anyway. So the result of tonight's action would be we would be rescinding that from our policies. The second we've had the introduction, we had a 21 day comment period. No comment. And so this is primarily a housekeeping measure we're taking. The second is a modification of the district performance auditing policy. The amendment formalizes the participation of two community members on the audit committee. Committee. For more than two decades, we've had community members who generally have auditing experience or other professional experience relevant to the audit committee serving on that committee. At some point, the language dropped out of the policy, so we're adding it back in. So this is just a modification. Those community members will be ex officio members of the committee. This also. This policy had a 21 day comment period. There were no comments received. And so we should be prepared to move ahead with the one rescinding one policy and the other would be adopting the modifications. Excellent. So then. Thank you so much. Then let's start with the rescission of 0.01010 P. Actually, Chair, can we take all these in combination? I would make a motion to do so if there's no objection. That would be great. Are there any objections to taking all these policies at one time? Two of them. Two of them. These two. Right. Who wants the second Andrew? Motions. All right, let's go back to you. Is there anything else we need to say? Not on the. Not on those ones. We have later on. First readings, but that's later on. Okay. Is there any public comment, Ms. Bradshaw? No. Excellent. Just to be clear, are we doing all. Did you. All four of them, Director Edwards, or just the. There's just two. The other ones are first readings, which is a whole. We don't adopt first readings. We have first readings. So they have a Student Enrollment and Transfer and Adoption of Religious and Cultural Observances. They're listed under second reading, so. But you're right, I think they are first readings. You're right. They're listed as first readings, but. Well, no, they're listed as second readings. Sorry, I don't mean to confuse things. Yeah, we have four second readings. Those were four. I was thinking. But you're right, you didn't go through all. Yeah. Okay. So I'm gonna just really quick on the other two. We also had revisions to the student enrollment and transfer policy, and these were revisions that came recommended that came out of the audit. And we're hoping to get. Get them approved so that for the upcoming enrollment and transfer cycle that we have these changes in place. And then the second. The other second reading we're having, again, this would be an adoption of the policy is Religious and Cultural observances policies. And this is a new policy. We didn't have any comment during the 21 day comment period. Period. But we did. We have had lots of comment over the years when the district scheduled over and held school activities on days that were either religious or cultural, culturally significant for families in our district. So what we're trying to do with this policy is really set, sort of set out our values that we are going to try and avoid scheduling school related activities on days that have been designated religious and culturally significant. And I think tonight when we get to our calendar, we'll see sort of the other pairing, how that plays out in that we designate them now. So hopefully this will address something that's been raised for at least. I know two decades within our school community that we didn't have before, formal policy about how we observed religious and culturally significant days. So I'll make a motion to approve resolution 6814 through 6817. And as a. As a block. As a block. Second. Bye. Bye. Second. Okay, so 684, 6814 through 6817. Do I have to read off when I do this? So I have to read the numbers or can I just say that? Fantastic. The board will now vote on. The board will now vote on 681, resolution 6814 through 6817. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All in favor or not, say no. Student Director Silverstein. Yes. Fantastic. And there are no extensions. Everybody voted. So Resolution 6814 through 6817 is approved by a vote of 7 to 1 with Student Director Silverstein unofficially voting yes. Excellent. Thank you. All right, we're doing good. So now let me figure out where I'm at. This is why. Now we're back at the next section of public comment for the regular public comment. Now we're going to have General Public comment. Ms. Bradshaw, do we have anyone signed up for public comment? We do. Fantastic. Yasmin Correa, Jennifer Evans, Dean Williams and Kelly George. Excellent. While they are coming, I'm going to go over the guidelines again for public comment as I stated earlier. But I want to remind essentially. Don't be rude. I want to remind PPS staff that they may not provide testimony about students or that could violate confidentiality protections under ferpa. This includes testimony using information that could identify students, especially in their school community, by the use of direct or indirect linkages such as school grades, special education or other statuses. Now, before you get ready to go, please make sure that you begin your comment that you clearly state your name and spell spell your last name. You'll have three minutes to speak and then you'll hear a sound after three minutes, which means that you essentially have 30 seconds to to wrap things up. If I start talking that it's not me trying to be rude, it simply means I'm just watching a clock and I'll glow. I'll like start slow and then ramp up and get louder so at least we have some level of warning that I'm talking again. All right. So I can start. Go. All right. Hi. Thank you Board of Directors for letting me speak tonight. My name is Yasmin Correa, Last name C O R R E A. I am a para educator over at Boise Elliot Humboldt and I'm in the K2 communication behavior classroom. I'm a proud PFSP member and stand in solidarity with Pat, sciu, DCU and at you. Please note that I'm not speaking to any individual child when I know for a fact this is happening. Most of these situations are happening across to all of my PPS colleagues. There's definitely not enough time for me to say what I want to say, but I'll start off with saying that I'm primarily here for my students as their advocate. Like every other paraeducator across this district, however, I'm in absolute disbelief that this school board sitting in front of me along with special education department administrators and district leadership falsely advertises to the greater public about a student centered education that uses equity, inclusion, restorative justice and trauma informed education when reality this is not happening in our sped focused programs in schools? If equity is about being fair and making sure that others are included and supported, then how is it that neither equity nor inclusion truly exist in our schools when we have a district who willingly push our students of high needs aside and will wrongfully place children into neighborhood schools and expect them to succeed while also placing staff into unsafe situations without any legitimate training. You are directly failing these children by not having true equity in the Special education department and not holding spend administrators accountable for doing their jobs and fully supporting our students. Since stepping into a focus classroom is scary for a lot of people, I don't know how my team is supposed to be doing academic work when there's five kids who need one on one support along with eight kids present with other eight kids present who need small groups or individual support for academics, all while my team is short staffed as is. We have kids in gen ed majority of the time who are in need of dire support and yet we can't serve them because of the high amounts of needs in our classroom. Imagine also having to deal with this with the sped teacher out long term, absent long term, even with a sub present. The pressure on paras is beyond me. I have been bitten to the point where it's broken skin, had scratches, bruises from students. I've been spat in my face, including today multiple times. And none of these students get any repercussions for their behavior and it continuously happens without any restorative justice practices. And I wish I would get training in that. But I guess it's okay since a lot of people would see paraeducators and educational assistants like me in PPS's glorified Be Babysitters in a punching bag and expect us to return the next day. I also don't have an actual living wage or legitimate training that is actually helpful other than legally restraining a child. If PPS refuses to bargain with PFSP in good faith, this district will lose more support staff and the people that the district claims to be the backbones of pps. And I hope this is this public comment is a testament to how truly hardworking our PFSP staff are and how much we care about the work we do for our students every day. Thank you. Thank you so very much. Speaking is not easy. You know, a lot of people think that you just go come up there and it's just go rattle off and it gets a little nerve wracking at times. So I just want to pause and just say thank you so much for having the courage to come up and say something in the midst of all of that. So thank you. Yeah, I was kind of. I was a little scared there. Yeah, it's more of. I feel like all of my colleagues are really suffering and I know I'm one of them as well. But yeah, a lot. I feel like I've been able to, with the union, get to know more of my colleagues and it's very much of a universal experience at this point. But yeah, thank you for coming. Thank you so much. Yes, my name is Dean Williams W I L L I A M S I'm the parent of a fourth grader in the Portland public school system, and I'm here to speak on behalf of the Portland Federation of School Professionals, the pfsp. UN My intended audience is PPS parents and all other folks who support our public schools, a couple of hundred of whom unfortunately have just recently left. But the PFSP is a labor union composed of para educators, sign language interpreters, physical and Occupational therapists, library assistants, administrative assistants, and many others. Altogether, over 50 job titles fall under the PFSP. These folks are the glue that hold our schools together, who enable our teachers to effectively do their jobs. An example, a special education teacher's assistant for K through second grade students. Their job involves assisting the teacher with an array of tasks, including the obvious help with writing, math, reading. But there's also diaper changes, behavior management, eating and cleaning, hygiene, learning social skills, and communication skills. Any teacher will tell you, any student will too. These folks are critical in our kids classrooms. This paraeducator starts out at $19.20 an hour, $40,000 a year. And that's not inadequate. Unsafe staffing levels are not okay. Not for what we ask of them, not for the responsibilities that they carry. PFSP is currently in contract negotiation with Portland Public Schools, who believes it has an extra advantage against these workers. When you pay your workers so little, going out on strike hurts them even more. Most of these folks are living paycheck to paycheck, working second and third jobs. But the PFSP union has so far rejected two unacceptable, tentative agreements, with record breaking numbers of their members voting, and if PPS remains intractable, they will strike. A quote from John McDuffie, PFSP president, after the most recent rejection of an unacceptable tentative agreement, quote, our members are frustrated and exhausted. They want a living wage, safe working conditions, and a higher quality of life. These are the same workers who were there on the front lines during the pandemic, showing up every day to support students both in the classroom and behind the scenes, even when staffing shortages put them in harm's way, unquote. If PFSP goes on strike, possibly in March, they ask for our support. We parents, we proponents of public school education. They ask that we show our solidarity with their cause by calling, texting, emailing, the Portland public school administrators, and also these board members. They also ask that if they go on strike, that our kids do not cross their picket lines, that we keep our kids out of school during a strike. That's a big ask, I know, especially in light of recent missed days. But we live in troubled times, to use the cliche. And solidarity with our public school workers, with workers in general, with unions, is just the first step in making a livable world. Thank you. Thank you so much for your comments, Ms. Bradshaw. Is there any other public comment? Would you like me to call the two people who didn't come up? Yes, please. Jennifer Evans. Kelly George. Okay, well, I want to thank everyone that did come up and share their comments. Again, like I said, I know that coming up to the dais is not. It's not always an easy thing to do, but it is imperative that you do so so that you can truly share your voices and so that it can go on record and you can be heard. All right. With that being said, I want to move us to our board and committee conference reports. And so this would be a space and time where we could get an update on what's happening in some of the committees and also get an update on these Superintendent search. So, board members, is there anything that you would like us to like to share about your committee committee that you got going on right now? You. You can. Don't have to say something. You can say pass. You can say pass. We can. You. I don't want you to feel pressure. There's no pressure. No pressure. So I have something that's not related to the policy committee, but I have something related to the committee that was action that was paused from last year. So there was a local option levy committee. And we paused action because we made the decision not to refer the ballot measure at the last election and instead we're going to wait for the May. This. This May election. So just wanting to note both for the board and the community that in February we. We likely will have a renewal come before the board. We would have to take action at the no later than the second meeting in February. In order to qualify for the May. For the May ballot, we have to have something to the elections office by March 1st. So I just want to flag that as sort of upcoming activity. And by having it on the May ballot, then we also would have an opportunity then in addition to, as we've talked about quite extensively, look to the November ballot for the next bond. Thank you. Anyone else? Yeah, just really quick. Student success committee talked about equitable grading practices and then proficiency based grading as well, which I'm hoping to get more student voices on it. This is something that's been shown to be best practices. I think we're a little bit behind in implementing it, but hopefully we're exploring more ways we can support teachers too, because it just makes life easier for everyone. Thank you. Thank you. All right, thank you, everyone. At this point, I guess we will move on to the implementation of our math curriculum. Superintendent Guerrero, would you please introduce this item? Excuse me. Hello? Yeah, you out there? Yes, I'm still here. Let me just give a quick update on the superintendent search piece. So we've already put out there that we have hired the interim superintendent Dr. Sandy Husk, who will be coming on board I believe February 12th to make that transition with our superintendent Guerrero. It was a. A lot of work that was done, especially over the holiday season. So I just definitely wanted to make sure I gave kudos to director Berm Edworth and director Scott for putting that time in to not only just identify an interim, but also with the due diligence process, negotiation process and the whole nine yards. So that's the update on the interim superintendent. We also moving forward, we have received eight proposals for the superintendent search services firms. And so what will happen next is we will have a subcommittee to review, score and recommend three firms to the full board. Then the full board will select the firms that will help us find our next superintendent. And that's update on that. Thank you. Thank you sir. We, we appreciate it all. I apologize. I couldn't. I didn't see your hand and I should have known you was gonna say something. I should have known. No worries. No worries. I know you. I know we trying to get done. So I made it quick and brief and I appreciate it. I appreciate it. All right now, soup, you can. You can jump in on the math curriculum. Awesome. Always happy to talk about teaching and learning related topics. So the board has asked for an update on where we are with our math curriculum implementation. The next few agenda items. You'll notice we have a greater than usual showing of our district staff here. So a number of them are going to come up and talk about where we are with our investment and our implementation of mathematics standards based curriculum. Providing an update will be our Chief of Schools, Dr. John Franco, Christina Howard, our interim CAO, Dr. Emily Glasgow, Senior Director, Pre K5 Core Academics, Joanna Tobin, Senior director, Middle grades core academics and Dr. Philippe Priestic, our Senior Director for high school core academics. So together they work. Share with you a snapshot of where we are with our math curriculum implementation. Thank you, superintendent. Good evening board directors. My name is Christina Howard and I am the interim Chief Academic officer. I am pleased to share the facilitation tonight with several others as Superintendent mentioned. Dr. John Franco, our Chief of Schools, Dr. Emily Glasgow, Senior director of pre K core academics, Joanna Tobin, senior Director of middle grades and Dr. Philippe Hari Stich, our Senior Director of high school core academics. We know there is a lot of excitement and curiosity about the early literacy grant and we are excited to share this Update during the January 23rd board work session. For tonight's purposes, we are here to share about our K12 math curriculum implementation. And for our agenda tonight, we are going to start with our why and our approach to advancing towards educational equity. Next, the Office of School Performance is going to share about math curriculum implementation, monitoring and follow up at the school level and each of our grade band senior directors will share high level information about each of the curriculum being used, initial implementation data and student outcome data. It is important to note that we are still in our early implementation stages. K5 is in year three and 612 is in year two. During our early implementation years, we want to see teachers using the adopted curriculum materials and working with their colleagues and professional learning communities to understand the new approaches to teaching and learning. I'm going to reiterate this quite a bit throughout the presentation. When we are looking at early implementation in the classroom, we are looking for materials in students and teachers hands and teachers pacing. As we move to deeper levels of implementation. In later years, we are looking at the fidelity of implementation. As teachers become more and more familiar with the materials and learning together, the fidelity of implementation should increase. The implementation data we will share tonight really focuses on the earlier stages of CREAT curriculum implementation and the usage of the curriculum. At the end of tonight's presentation, I will share the next steps we are implementing. January to June which begins to look at the fidelity of implementation and allow for any questions you may have. Next slide please. I would like to ground us in our why and our roadmap to educational equity. We often put up this slide throughout our district and we ground ourselves in this across the instruction and school communities division. We believe our adult actions should prioritize the three instructional priorities, instructional framework, high quality instructional materials and teacher professional learning. We believe by prioritizing and narrowing our focus and actions to the three instructional priorities we will shift our student outcomes and we will advance towards educational equity. Next slide please. Good evening directors. I am again John Franco, Chief of Schools. Happy to talk to you about curriculum implementation more so how we what we look for when we go into classrooms and into schools. We also have. As you can see we have a large group here. These are our senior directors of schools. They wanted to be here. I think it's really important and they truly are at the front lines and working with our building leaders in our schools. So the first piece just want to go through these. Then of course at the very end be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Sorry my. I gotta lean over a little more. My back is hurting me here. So first we have school Continuous improvement plans. These are updated. Every school has one. We have tracked these. They are noted for all to see and a Google sheet. Also, our senior directors are consistently providing feedback on this plans using a consistent template, which is very important. And on that feedback, we are specifically noting our instructional priorities, which center around teacher professional learning, curriculum implementation, which is what we're talking about, and our instructional framework. Principals do meet with senior directors at least once per week as a group, in cohort, and individually at least once every two weeks, depending on school performance. Consistent visit template. We do use a consistent visit template highlighting instructional priorities and observing classrooms together. So that is a big piece. That is a change that we have instituted this year because we want to develop a regular cadence of when we are visiting schools. We are making sure that we're having consistent conversations so that the principal experience and the expectation is consistent across the board. So, for example, during these visits, an expectation is that the senior director will walk classrooms. And when they walk into classrooms, the first question that we are asking is, is the curriculum behavior implemented? And we should see that from the beginning. By the end of this year, the expectation is now. We had a little thing that happened in November, so our timing was potentially off. But one of the things that we're excited about and expecting is that every teacher, regardless if you are on formal cycle, will be visited at least three to five times per year. And that's regardless again of whether or not you are on evaluation cycle or not. And that's very important again, as we establish a regular cadence about getting into classrooms and making sure we establish that culture. So there. So during those informal observations, if you will, there are specific things that we are looking for. And we have a consistent informal observation tool. And that also. And that is grounded in our evaluation framework, and that is through Charlotte Danielson. And so we use that and principals are incorporating that because what we found earlier on previously is that principals were just doing some things different. They were getting into classrooms, but it wasn't necessarily using a common tool. This informal observation piece is helping with that and then also provides an avenue for more calibration and collaboration with senior directors and principals. And a piece specifically around the eighth grade, since we're talking or not eighth grade, since we're talking about math curriculum. So if I were to use the informal observation template, for example, Standards 3B is Engage students in learning instructional materials and resources. Instructional materials and resources are suitable to the instructional purposes. So that's the proficiency level right there. So that is in the informal observation template. I would also highlight in that template it 1D, which is teacher displays solid knowledge of the standards and important concepts in the subject matter. So when we're talking about, again, math curriculum, since this is the topic, there are specific points that we expect to note documentation on within that informal observation tool. Also, we do quarterly reviews with senior directors, instructional coaches, and ilts, which are the instructional leadership coach teams within each school. And the purpose of the quarterly reviews is for senior directors to ask questions, to be thorough with their questioning in terms of how it's going in regards to the skip in regards to instructional priorities. So it's not just with the principal. Now we get to have those conversations with the IoTs. Instructional rounds, extremely important. The instructional rounds was actually when you talk to principals, professional development wise was probably what they would say is the best PD that they've had. And so a big piece of instructional round is identifying a problem of practice. Our problem of practice centers around grade level standards, aligned instruction and curriculum implementation. And so it's a center point. And so when we're consistent going around into rounds into schools, knowing that that's the consistent marker, it just helps again from a collaboration calibration perspective. And we do use a consistent tool, which was developed this year to help collect that data. Right. And then we will also do. And they'll share some data in terms of a survey that we just conducted with building leaders, where they will self report. We'll do that again, you know, at the end of the year. So we'll have again a percentage. Our goal this year was around, was 80%, I believe was the goal. Next year it'll be 100%. But we have to have those numbers and that helps, obviously, with implementation. I talked a lot. Sorry, Director Green. I know you want to be fast. No, thank you, Dr. Franco. I think I'm up next. I'm Emily Glasgow. I'm the senior director of pre K5 core academics. We were hoping now to sort of dig into each grade band and give you a little bit of a clearer picture of what early implementation of our curricular resources looks like in each grade band and what some of our early outcomes are. So I'll start with K5 and then I'll pass to my secondary colleagues for 6.8 and 9:12 for K5 mathematics. We are currently in our third year of iReady math implementation. In all of our K5 classrooms, students now have 75 minutes of core math instruction daily. This breaks down to 60 minutes with the core I ready lesson and an additional 15 minutes of either math talks or math practice on the Digital MyPath program. During the core math block, students are engaged with grade level standards aligned math tasks. They use the Try, Discuss, Connect routine to grapple with problems and then share their strategies and approaches with classmates and then connect new learning to novel problems. Math discourse and use of tools and strategies are critical to the math learning that's happening happening in our classrooms. All K5 students take the iReady diagnostic assessment three times per year, which places them at their appropriate practice level on the digital MyPath tool. It's recommended that students spend up to 45 minutes per week practicing just right skills on this digital program. Students who then need additional intervention in math in addition to everything else I've mentioned receive this below grade level support during the what I Need or Win block that's scheduled daily we began training teachers in the IREADY curriculum in summer of 2021. That summer we provided initial training to 96% of K5 educators each year. Following, we've continued to offer 101 training to new educators or educators who change grades and we've also offered continued deeper level training for continuing education. Our 2022-23 learning walks found that 81% of K5 mathematics classrooms visited were using the IREADY resources on a teacher survey administered by an external evaluator in the 2022-23 school year, teachers self reported a similar outcome. 83% said that they had fully transitioned over to the IREADY curriculum district wide. As we look at student outcome data, we've risen 3% in our rates of student proficiency on the OSAS assessment, rising from 43% meet or exceed to 46% meet or exceed overall when disaggregated. This equated to a 1% gain for Black students, a 1% gain for Latino students, and a 3% decline for Native students. Sixteen of our elementary schools made 5% or greater gains in proficiency on OSAS last split Markham, Lent, Lee, Woodlawn, Astor, Arlita, Boise, Elliott, Bridemyle, Buckman, Laurelhurst, Lewis, Richmond, Rigler, Rose, City Park, Siton, and Whitman. You heard earlier in the year about the terrific implementation and leadership work happening at Sitton Elementary. While Sitton is not the only elementary school that has seen marked improvements in math outcomes, their disaggregated data is a positive proof point that when implemented with high integrity and support, the IREADY curriculum can support all of our students and most specifically our focus priority students in accelerated mathematics outcomes. And you can see those outcomes highlighted on this slide disaggregated by race for our priority populations of students. I'm going to pass to Joanna Tobin for six through eight. Great. Thank you Emily. Good evening board student representative and superintendent. It's a joy to support grade 6 through 8. Then share with you some of our progress in math tonight. As Christina Howard opened with in grades six through eight, we are in our second year of implementation of mid school math in grade six eight for comprehensive middle schools also. That includes our K8s of course that have our sixth through eighth grade students there as well. This program emphasizes conceptual understanding, really emphasizes a growth mindset and using real world application to solve problems. You may have heard this once or twice in your parenting or board career. Middle grade student asking when on earth will I use this math again? Right? Does that sound familiar? And this curriculum really addresses that question with taking a real world problem and a learning target and then framing that in a way that students need to grapple with that productive struggle together cooperatively in the classroom. And so that's really where we see that meaning making happen and where we are very pleased with the med school math curriculum as far as implementation goes. As Dr. Franco mentioned earlier this winter, our principals did a self report on the use of the curriculum and this is one data point where we really find that 91% of our teachers approximately really are using the curriculum. We also have trained 100% of our teachers. We continue to do so. As Emily shared through our professional learning approach. Any new teachers we ensure are trained on the curriculum as well. And we find that close to 90% or 87.5% of teachers are on pace. Our middle grades team has been working very hard on piecing guides also throughout this unique year, really ensuring that support happens for our teachers so they know just where to be when they're on pace. Those PLCs, as you've heard so much about those professional learning communities, those conversations are that much richer when our teachers are on pace together with their implementation of the curriculum. And so I really thank my team for that dedication and hard work this year around that in support of our teachers. We really look forward to being in classrooms over the next couple months continuing with that monitoring. As Christina Howard mentioned, as we move into the spring when we talk about student outcomes, this is where I'd like to highlight a few of our schools. Aster this past year saw a 9.7% gain. Beaumont Middle School, who you recently heard from in a board meeting, experienced a 10.9% change. Change in the positive direction. Gray Middle School also had a notable 8.9% change. Selwood Middle School with a 9.5% change. What you also don't see on the slide here is also worth mentioning, of course is Mount Tabor, Jackson and Laurel Hurst all saw over a 5% gain in their OSAS scores in math. So certainly credit to the dedication of our teachers really implementing the curriculum. And we're digging into that to really learn from those promising practices and digging into that data to understand the why and you know, why we are seeing some of these positive trends. Also, as Emily also referenced in her previous slide, really looking at our student populations disaggregated by race, we see that all of our students from the 2022-23 school year on the OSAs saw a gain from 39% to to 43%. You can see our black student population was 7% maintained the 7%. Our Latino population saw an increase from 17% to 20% and our native population went from 14% to 12%. So we really are looking at the why around that, looking at how we can continue to support all of our learners and look forward with the implementation of progress to come this spring. And with that, I will pass it over to my colleague for high school. Good evening. Can you hear me? Okay? So this is the second year of the math curriculum implementation at the high school level. We're using Illustrative Mathematics. This curriculum is aligned with Common Core Standards, with Oregon Math Standards and is highly rated by ED Reports as well. The curriculum helps students develop a deep understanding of mathematical concepts, build procedural fluency, and allow students to solve mathematical problems that they encounter in their personal lives. The preliminary data indicates that we're well on our way to making sure that the curriculum is used in our classrooms. You can see that 96% of our teachers have been trained thus far. 80% of our school leaders indicated that teachers are using the curriculum and are on pace. We don't have reliable OSAS data because about 50% of our high schoolers did not take the test last year. But we do have course passage rates which are above 75% across the three core math classes for algebra, geometry and algebra 2. The big exception here are the course passage rates for our native students when it comes to geometry and algebra 2 or algebra algebra 34 as we've referred to. The really exciting news is that we continue to see a growing number of students taking advanced math courses. These are typically courses that our juniors and seniors take. We're seeing increases of 10 to 25% across our racial groups over the last three years, including our black, Hispanic and multiracial students. Seven hundred and fifty students, high schoolers right now are taking Dual credit courses. These are courses that have been approved by Portland Community College for college credit. And these kiddos collectively have the potential of earning $375,000 in worth of college credits this year just in math. So that's really exciting to see. Yes, free money. I mean, not free money, but money well earned. And that's really the hope. And the theory of action is that if we have a strong foundation of an adopted curriculum in early grades, more of our students will be accessing college level coursework before they even finish high school. So thank okay, here we go. As I just close this out, I shared at the beginning of the presentation, we're really shifting our focus to looking at the fidelity of implementation of the math curriculum starting this month. And so again, earlier usage is looking at teachers having it in their hands, students having the materials, becoming familiar with with all of the curriculum. Now we're looking at fidelity. So are they using all the scaffolds and supports that are built into the curriculum? Are they working in their PLCs to understand and deeply look at the student work and analyze that and make adjustments? Are they looking at their data and using that to drive their decision making? And so when I'm saying fidelity of implementation, that is what we're shifting to now. Content administrators who are experts in the curriculum will be participating participating in implementation walks across all schools focusing on observing that fidelity of implementation starting this month. They actually go out into schools on Tuesdays and Fridays and we'll continue that throughout the course of the year, getting to every school by the end of the year. Cross office team, in collaboration with research, assessment and accountability will be developing more systems around curriculum based assessments. Cross office central office administrators will be participating in learning walks in January and April. Today we had members of cross office teams in collaboration with the principal and the instructional coach, walk multiple sites because we're in our January learning walk session now and so that is taking place again, looking at the fidelity of the curriculum implementation, the Office of School Performance will be conducting instructional rounds across all schools in collaboration with central office administrators, building leaders and coaches. The 68 math team will be working with stakeholders to discuss math sequencing and alignment. And because the professional learning days are now student days, the teacher, professional learning and content administrators are working with schools to provide school based professional learning to support curriculum implementation through PLCs using the data. So we want to use the data that we're collecting to deploy on site supports because we know we don't have those learning days anymore. So how are we wrapping around schools and deploying our staff to schools to be able to support those teams, to deeply look at their curriculum and understand that, to get to the next level. So this concludes our presentation for tonight, and I just want to thank you all. I wanna. I'm sure there's gonna be some comments from the board. I know I've got one. So let's start this way and see if student director Silverstein would like to say anything first from a student perspective. And then we'll work our way around the room. And I see, Gary, I see your hand is up. So I'll make sure that I don't forget this time. Thank you for all of your work. I guess I'm interested to see what the data looks like in a couple of years, just because from students, I've heard very varied opinions about the way the curriculum was implemented and how the curriculum is working for them. Yeah. I'm just curious, as a former primary teacher, do you think this new curriculum is that much better than what we've had before, or is it just new? Yeah, I mean, what I would say specifically about the K5 curriculum is we are now working with a K5 curriculum that is grade level standards aligned and is putting grade level standards aligned tasks in front of every student every day. And I could not say that about our previous math curriculum. So from that standpoint, you know, no curriculum is a silver bullet. No curriculum has everything. But that puts. Puts us at a really, really solid floor. And when used really well, this curriculum really engages young students in some of what Joanna was talking about, that really meaty, rigorous discourse and strategy, sharing and thinking about mathematics in a way that our previous curriculum didn't demand. Because I'm looking at 75 minutes for kindergarten and math. Obviously it's a lot of games and not sitting there doing math problems. It just seemed like a lot. Absolutely. What I would say is this curriculum goes deep, not wide, which is what the common core State standards ask of us. So often during a math lesson. Kids are really like, debating and engaging and they have manipulatives and things out that they're kind of showing different models of how you solve something. Right. On one problem. Problem deep as a class for a while. Right. And then, you know, because it's kindergarten, we stretch and we move and we do the things we do to make it appropriate for kindergarten. But, you know, they're not sitting there like filling out worksheets. No, they better not be. It's engaging in that way and appropriate for students. Right. And so you talked about using the data how do you collect it, who collects it, how do you use it? So again, I can talk about that for K5 and then maybe pass on. I mean there I talked a little bit about the iReady diagnostic assessment that we take three times a year in K5. That's a digital assessment. And so that data is immediately available to teachers and also places students on this digital tool that you know, at their individualized level. And then there are several other curriculum embedded assessments across the curriculum, across each unit that teachers collect the data on and then use in their PLCs when they're sitting down to talk with their colleagues about so what next? Sure, I can add to that. For mid school math there are a few components included within the curriculum. There's one that I want to mention that's unique within this curriculum because it really calibrates based off of the student's ability. And so they actually get to do some just in time practice that is still working within grade level. And so that that is unique and helpful. In addition to that, we do the MAP assessment twice a year. We review that data with that third option in the spring being optional. That has been helpful just to see progress over time. And we do have a third tier of support with iReady for our Tier 3 support for students needing, as Emily often says, an extra scoop. Multiple extra scoops of that math support. We also look forward to bringing forward more of our work of really looking at six, eight deeply and how we best meet our students needs. Really emphasizing the use of mid school math. So that's more information for another day. But we definitely have more work that we're doing beyond what we're sharing with you tonight. Really emphasizing our needs within 6, 8 for math. I mean at the high school level it's about course passage rates and ensuring that our students are on track to graduate at one level. But as I mentioned in my presentation, it's also about students accessing higher level math, going above and beyond what the core graduation requirements are, using the opportunity to earn college level credit while still in high school. And so that's also data that we're looking at not just how many students are meeting the basic expectations, but also how many students are accessing higher level coursework and then having support for those that aren't making it. Absolutely. And intervening as soon as possible. So at the high school level we're fortunate to have every other week what are called flex periods or flex times. And teacher teams do a really effective job of using those opportunities to really support students who are experiencing some deficiencies. So rather than waiting until the end of the year, our schools, our teachers, use those times to support students around specific learning targets. Thank you. Great. Thank you for the presentation. Two quick questions. You talked a little bit about high school students and advanced math. Does the curriculum allow for accelerated Math at the K8 level? I know that's been a topic in past years. Okay, we'll go in reverse order this time. Love the question. We have done a lot of work around this. We need to make sure that our students access grade level standards aligned. Right. So, so sixth grade, seventh grade, eighth grade. We do have some current pieces within our system that do accelerate a bit prematurely. And so we're really looking at how we best address that and also maintain an advanced pathway that's very important. We have some system wide pieces that accelerate some a little too soon. And so what we're aiming to do is maintain an advanced pathway for sure and also make sure that our criteria for getting into those advanced courses are not doing so in a way that foregoes the importance of mastering 6th, 7th and 8th. So that's been a lot of our work recently. And I would say within the K5 classrooms with the IREADY curriculum, it's really built for differentiation up and down and across, in between. Right. And so over the course of a week, week, an introduction of a new concept might start. Whole group. And then there would be think pair shares and small group and kids kind of accessing where they can. And then over the course of the week, there'd be time for small groups where the teacher can differentiate exactly how different groups of kids are getting supported through the curriculum. And then the iReady MyPath tool, the digital tool is a personalized pathway for every student where they get to practice exactly where their diagnostic places them. So those are all opportunities for different differentiation and acceleration. Okay, thanks. My second question, similar to Director Sullivan's, is sort of about the data. And I'm curious how. I really appreciate it in terms of your next steps. You know, that sort of fidelity and implementation of the curriculum seems really important. And I'm curious, given all this data we're collecting and seeing some of these successes at certain schools, what we're doing to share those best practices across the district. And I saw some of that actually at the beginning of the year with the superintendent at the, you know, for our principals and our building leaders. Right. Sharing some of those success stories and what those principals are doing. And I guess I'm specifically wondering, do we have anything in place for some of our educators who are showing real success that we're seeing the results of. They've, you know, their students have moved up 10 points, 15 points for them to share with some of their peers within the district some of their best practices and what they're doing with the curriculum that seems to be working. I love that. I'll grab that for middle grades, as we've mentioned, we're going on implementation walks here over the next few months and we have this idea in infancy stage of really from there identifying some classrooms to spotlight. And then we have the question of how could we create a little bit of a collaboration to go in and see some of those spotlight classrooms or should our educators be willing to have us film, you know, how can we really capture these lovely practices that are happening and great teaching and learning opportunities to really do some peer to peer learning in our district? Okay, either end of the spectrum. Thanks for sharing the implementations. Exciting to see it roll out and to see some of the preliminary data. Just to build on director Scott's question, I'm going to ask about sort of the higher levels of math at the high school level. What's the highest level of math you could take like the end of the sequence, off the top of my head, I would say Calculus bc. So second year of calculus. Second year of calculus. So if you were in middle school and you stayed in the 6th, 7th and 8th grade math classes and sequences without acceleration, would you be able to by your senior year in high school take that highest level of math or would you have had to take that some acceleration in the middle school? Getting to Calculus BC would be very difficult at that point. That said, there are opportunities to accelerate in high school and many students do take two classes a year. So students who come in at algebra take algebra their freshman year, which is a perfectly appropriate place to be as a 9th grader. So students can take geometry and algebra 3, 4 the following school year, then take pre calc their junior year and then take calc their senior year. So they just have a lot of math that second year. Yeah, and that's the hope is that our kiddos come into high school with a solid foundation of not just procedural fluency, but conceptual understanding as well and application. But it's not, not that you wouldn't be able to accelerate within high school. It's not like you'd correct. It's inconsistent. And the other thing to point out, as you all know, high school students need 24 credits to graduate. They have room for 32. And so there's plenty of space in their schedule. Yes. Can I just say one more thing? Sorry to interrupt. There is also a concern that students should do take algebra 1 in 8th grade sometimes don't take 3 years of high school level math. And that's something that we want to avoid. Right. Yeah. Just before we leave this point because it's actually I wanted to clarify the reason I asked my question about that was actually to get to this exact point. And I think what's. I'm assuming that this curriculum is based in evidence in practice. And I think one of the important, important conversations to have with our community is exactly what we're having here. And it's hard because particularly if you, if you have a child who is gifted in math as a parent, you often want to see them go into accelerated math. And I think if there is data and evidence that shows that a solid foundation. 6, 7, 8. And then my own child didn't. But, but she has friends who have taken, you know, two math classes in one year. You know, that there is that opportunity to your point I think is really important. And, and I'm assuming the evidence shows that those kids might actually even be better off as a result. And I think the more we can have that conversation with our community, the more they'll understand that this is not a punishment, this is actually based in practice and it actually is intended to have a better outcome in the end. Yeah. Just to follow on that point. I know there's been a lot of conversation about who has access to acceleration and I think we would really benefit by having clarity of when that's appropriate. And then also the benefits of staying in the curriculum because you still can finish that highest level math if you desire. So that was on one end. I wanted to ask then a question about some of the. The middle school data. And you know, it was really disappointing and sad to see the 7 to 12% proficiency rates for black and native students. And I noticed there was an overall of 30 went from 39 to 43. I'm wondering what was. Didn't have a breakout for white students. Students. What I'm assuming if you have say 39% proficiency of all that that includes all and so the average would be lower. Do you have the data for. We can grab that. I think your quick math is really right on and my apologies for leaving that out on there because their numbers would likely be higher and so like the gap would be even greater. And so I'm going to then just sort of focus in on this. The comments about the material being aligned with grade level standards, what are we doing that is allowing a student who didn't master, wasn't proficient in the grade level standards, who now is in the next grade level, is now getting the curriculum in the next grade level standard to not only master the one they hadn't mastered, but then also the next level or grade of proficiency. I think it would be best to hear from each of the grade bands for this one and share about the built in supports that are within the curriculum and how they actually are intentionally built to do that. Yeah, that's a great question. It's sort of the age old question of how we, how we do our work in differentiated classrooms. The research is exceedingly clear that every student needs grade level standards aligned core instruction. Right. We can expect students to get here if we're only teaching them here. Right. We've got to be raising everyone to the bar. So that's the expectation is every student is getting that every day during core block. Core block can be supported in different ways for different kids in elementary schools. Some of our elementary schools, we have interventionists, learning acceleration specialists, sometimes special education teachers, different teachers who sometimes push in to the core block and help scaffold and support access for all kids during that block. Then there are parts of the week, parts of the day that are differentiated where students might actually be working on different skills based on where they are. And then in our elementary schools, again, we have that win block every day in first through fifth grade. That's specifically the part of the day for those extra scoops that Joanna mentioned, where on top of your core instruction, on top of your personalized practice, you're getting that direct intervention if you need it. So that way you're getting, getting this, and you're getting this at the same time daily. So every day, if you had a student who wasn't proficient or you were a student who wasn't proficient at grade level, you would be getting an extra block every day. You'd be getting your regular standard based instruction, and then you'd be getting an extra block every day. In an elementary school school teams, based on data, each grade level team makes decisions about how to use that daily win block because it's for language arts and math. And so if a student needed intervention in all content areas, the team would need to work out how to differentiate that time across the week and how much, you know, how many minutes in each area a student gets. If you only needed it in math, you might get that every day. Do you think based on that model, we're going to see a significant closing of the gap. All research and data would suggest so. Right. That's the long game that research is very clear on. Again, that model of every student gets that core high standards instruction with scaffolds and supports and then as needed, students also get intervention on top. We know to Christina's like very early points in this presentation, all of this is learning for adults. Right. How you do this strategically, how you use that data well, how you plan your intervention. So we're trying to give very thoughtful guidance and clarity to our educators around the resources they should use in those situations. And adults are learning and win is new within the last couple years in PPs. Right. So everybody's learning their way into it and really trying to use the resources they have as effectively as possible. So I think when it all comes together, as it all comes together in a school like Siton, where we're seeing it all come together, we're seeing the results. So the difference between the past, when we had kids less than 10% proficient in a subgroup and now would be that they're the reason we're going to see something different and hopefully not in a really long game is that they have a standards aligned curriculum that the teachers have professional development in that is being implemented with fidelity. And for those students who need extra, they're getting extra. Yes, that's our theory of action. Thank you. Okay, stated. Well then the last question I just have is about pace. I know on the middle school it had a 87.5% on pace with what the instruction for the year. And I'm just curious about the time off in November and what impact we think that's going to have on being able to like. Will teachers by the end of the year have an opportunity to have gotten all the way through the curriculum? Yes, we've done some reprioritizing and compacting, if you will, of some of the lessons to make sure that we can get back on pace. So our team worked very hard on that and communicated that back out to our teachers. As far as the program pieces, did you want me to touch on the first question for the grade band piece or was that the. That's okay. I think, I think I've got the, the recipe that we're counting. Michelle's gonna. Well after Gary because Gary's hand was up and in order of the seats, Gary would be speaking right here. And then after Gary we will have Michelle. Director DePass. Excuse me. And then after Director DePass, we will have Director Wong. And then I will close us out with the discussions and get us back on time. Thank you. I think guys, for the presentation and I have some, some questions and I kind of did it as you guys were talking. So I kind of go. This is kind of started from the K5, a couple questions there. A couple questions. Middle school, couple questions during the high school segment. So when students aren't making gains, how are principals supported or held accountable? You got them moving seats now, Gary. You got them moving seats like whoa. Thanks, Director Holland. So I think the question was if schools aren't showing gains, how are principals held accountable? Is that accurate or supported? Or supported. I like that. Thank you. And so there are really two pieces to this. And yes, we go into this with our work with principals or building leaders. And we know that catalysts were student achievement. First are teachers, but then our building leaders are number two. So we really go into what, what does that support look like from a coaching perspective? And as you can see here, we do have our senior directors. And, and so I think the first piece is to make sure that our principals feel absolutely prepared from a curriculum implementation perspective that they absolutely know what is happening. And so I think that's extremely important. The second piece is, and which I mentioned or alluded to earlier, is our principals have to be in classrooms. Not only do they have to have the training which they have and are getting there in terms of curriculum implementation, but the standard about them being in every teacher's classroom consistently is extremely, extremely important. Because what we're trying to establish and need to establish is that culture of this isn't a gotcha, but I'm in your classroom and you are going to get feedback and sometimes it's going to be amazing feedback. Sometimes it's going to be, you know what, you're just not aren't doing what you need to be doing. And I'm going to follow up on the second day and I better see something like that. And so there's a coaching perspective that happens with the principal from that vantage point. And that's why our work with our senior directors are so important. And that's why I mentioned those pieces around the weekly visits and definitely at the least the bimonthly worth our principals with the standardized template with consistent questions and consistent protocols in regards to walk in classrooms. I would also say too, our data is very transparent in terms of what our principals share within cohorts and with senior leadership. And we do that during academic showcases. We do that during SKIP presentations where they are sharing three times a year progress on their SKIP goals. And so that from not only expectation perspective, but of course, that's built in accountability as well. And then so. And we're in. Our skip plans are extremely adaptable and adjustable. So we definitely look at it from a coaching perspective and support. I've been really pleased with our building leaders. They've been through so much. Absolutely. Without a doubt. And so from a support piece, we want to make sure. But at the same time, you know, we're not afraid or shy away from the hard conversations about holding our folks accountable and keeping the data at the forefront. And we're setting up systems and have set up systems to be able to do that. Okay. Another question is with the middle grades, how confident are we that educators know the difference between productive struggle and gaps in skills? And are principals leading trainings for their teachers? I love that question. And I think mathematics Learning in the 6, 8 classroom really does need to be about the productive struggle. And so I would say one of the big growth areas that this curriculum and the training around the curriculum has brought to our classrooms has been how does the teacher really change their instructional approach to being the one delivering the content, to being now being the one who's posing the problems. Right. And then helping students. Students match that learning target to that problem and have that productive struggle really work through things. And so we are seeing a shift over time, and our further implementation will support this as well of really changing what it looks and feels like within the math classroom. To your question around. I'm sorry, can I. Can you repeat it? Was it around the accountability of that happening? What I asked was, how confident are we that educators know the difference between the two and our principals leading the training for the teachers? I think that is the training. I mean, that is what's happening right now. That is the continued work. And so as Dr. Franco mentioned, the examples of feedback. An example of feedback would be if the teacher is talking the majority of the time, would we need to coach that teacher on releasing that and really getting comfortable with students doing the majority of the work and holding the majority of the conversation and reporting back in crosstalk an example of a professional learning that we did this week with our leaders that our assistant director of math and science led really was looking at a video. We actually watched a video with our leaders, an example of a classroom and dialogue in the classroom, and then had meaningful conversation about did the teacher hit the mark on this? It wasn't a PPS teacher, it was another teacher, but using our curriculum. And so how can. How are they meeting the mark? Not Meeting the mark, what needs to be improved? How do they pause their content conversation and know what types of questions to ask? How do we sort of track the conversation of it not just being from the teacher to the student, back to the teacher, back to the student? Right. We want to see it go from the student, build to another student and build upon that knowledge in the classroom. So that's an example. I think a quick answer is that is the work and that's the work that we're on the journey of improving. Just real quick, I'd just like to add, Director Hollins, is that the infusion of the instructional coach and added emphasis on instructional learning teams working hand in hand with the building leader? Because we do expect our building leaders to be instructional leaders. Absolutely, without a doubt. But we know that in order to have movement as a system and as a school, that efficacy has to take place amongst the building. And so the infusion of an instructional coach to assist with that, but then also an instructional learning team, you know, comprised of members of the staff to help lead professional development with staff has been extremely important. As a first of the high school. Are passing classes the same as meeting standards on the OSAs? We would, I would expect our students who do well in our core math courses to also do well on the OSAs. Oh, is that a yes or no? I don't. I guess my question is like a yes or no question. It wasn't an expectation of what we think our kids should do or not do. I mean, here's what I would say. I would say broadly speaking, there should be correlation between student performance in our core academic classes and OSAs. At the same time, OSAS as a test is a very different experience than what our students typically experience in their, in their classrooms. So it's quite possible that some students will not perform well in that particular setting on that particular test to experience success in their math classes. We all maybe were one of those people who don't test well or have experiences difficulties in a standardized testing environment. But generally speaking, because now we have a core math curriculum that is grade level standards aligned, we have a higher degree of confidence that our students will perform well on OSAs as well. As an example, if someone got a D in math class, so they passed in math class, you understand that same student should be able to meet the standards on the OSATs. I mean, D for me is not. D for me is below proficient. So I think that's the definition of D. So I don't think that any one of us, anybody here is Satisfied with students getting a D. Our goal is to ensure that our students meet proficiency, that they demonstrate adequate level of mastery and they ought to be prepared to do well in the OSAS as well. So I can just go on. From your explanation, I can assume that is a no to the question. Yes, that's a no. Okay. The other question I had is, and this is for the middle school, how confident are you that I ready will predict success on the OSAs for our students identified by our board goals, we use IREADY as a tier three additional support the. The map we do see. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. Can you, can you explain tier three for those that don't know what that is? Yeah. So tier one would be our first line of defense. That's our daily instruction using our adopted curriculum. Tier 2 is when we need a reteach of that Tier 1, simply stated, sometimes that's a little bit more. And then tier three is when we're really more significantly below grade level two to three years and beyond. And so we do have iReady, which is a program that does align with our element program, but also is not our core curriculum. This is really reserved for that additional learning beyond the day to day lessons. And so that is availed as an option as far as our interim assessments or our checkpoints beyond the core curriculum. The MAP growth assessment, we do see correlation to the OSAs. We see pretty strong correlation. And so it is a good checkpoint for us to watch and see how our students are responding to the instruction throughout the year. Okay, so you are confident that IREADY can predict success for the OSAs for our board goals, the things our students identify by our board goals? Yeah, I think the use of the assessment, the fall and the winter assessment with a MAP growth is a good indicator for us to watch and then see the summative assessment of the OSAS in the spring. Okay, last question. I think that's just for elementary too. And this goes back to my question around, you know, when students are making gains, given the specific. Can you give a specific example of a school struggle and how they intervene? And this is so for as a board member to know what we need to do to help support our principals as well. Can you say a little bit more about your question? So I was. This was actually an add on to my other question that I said earlier for the elementary when we talked about if a student is not making gains, how principal supported or held accountable. I just wonder was a. If you can give us a specific example every school that struggled and how we intervened and. And also what can we do as a board to help support Prince, our principal? He's asking for an example. Give us an example of how you did it. I think the office of school performances, because I always hear. Always hear sitting. And, and when I look at the raw data for sitting, and especially when we talk about the. The percentage growth for African Americans, we're talking about a small number of students I believe is almost under 10. So when we talk about sitting, which on the overall, they did well. But when it comes to our kids of color, it was such a small sample of kids that, you know, for instance, I want to say it was less than 10 kids. Well, yeah, one and a half or two moves. It makes a big jump. So I don't. I want to make sure that we're comparing apples to apples. So. Yeah, thanks. Appreciate the question. I am again, I. I want some of our senior directors get a little bit of FaceTime. So I'm going to call. Call up Ratty Lurie and he could talk a little bit about addressing some of Director Holland's questions around. Specifically around a school that you have worked with that maybe have struggled in the past. Sorry, I'm just reiterating the question. Hello, Chair Hollins. How are you? Hello. How's it going, Ratty? Good. I didn't bring any big soft chewy nerds for you. Oh, sucky ducky, man. So a little inside joke from mediation. So when I was hired as senior directors of schools, I was fortunate enough to be asked to support which at the time were seven K5 and K8 CSI TSI schools. Part of our work took us to work with the University of Virginia Professional Learning and Education. Throughout that process, the seven school cohorts worked to transform within their schools the things that they do. And part of that work was also working with the district core change team to set conditions at the district office to allow schools to succeed. Siton specifically, and I think, you know, you heard from principal Becky Barry and Assistant Principal Martinez earlier in the fall, first and foremost, the instructional leadership there was no nonsense. It is about students. It is about what we deliver for students. And it was interventions with educators and supporting them through observation and through evidence, supporting educator growth to support students with within the context of what is expected of the implemented curriculum. The other piece that we haven't really talked too much about that sit and did really well is their use of professional learning communities in that experience. Every Friday, as an example, both principal and assistant principal meant with K2 and 35 grade level teams and I attended several of those. And in every instance they talked about students by name. They talked about students and their proficiency, whether it was on a common piece of work that had happened that week or around a common assessment that happened. They asked the question about what do we want students to learn? How are we asking them to show it? Which students are proficient, which students are not, not yet proficient, and why are the students who are not yet proficient not yet proficient? In other words, where is the gap in the learning? And in that discussion they talked about what the next steps were going to happen that day, that week prior to the next professional learning community. That was, it was just no nonsense and you just did it. And that was their approach. And I think you heard from them. And the PLC aspect as well was really powerful in supporting direct change in the classroom. Yeah, and I get that I heard this stuff from sin, from sitting, you know, with the principal and stuff. Oh, okay. Well, sorry. Similarly. But when we talk about like our kids of color at sitting, when I look at the data, it was only two kids that actually passed, so. And they also had the UVA funding as well. So I guess I'm talking about more of a school that didn't have that additional support and funding. That didn't have that additional support and funding. Correct. Well, the last two years I'm with a new set of schools, so the last two years I worked with schools that all had the opportunity to go to uva. And I think I can point to Lent and Rigler as well with similar approaches to sort of no non stop sense expectations in the classroom and the use of professional learning communities. I know at Rigler, on a number of occasions throughout the year, the last couple of years, Principal Silvis used opportunities to have teachers go do some observations in each other's classrooms and then offer each other feedback for growth. And then they built their stamina and process that way to support our students. But the last two years the schools that I supported all have and had the extra pieces that come to the school from being identified, title being identified CSI or tsi. And then we also were all seven schools that I was with the last couple of years we also had the opportunity to work with the professional development through uva. So they were all similar in that sense. I don't know if that's helpful or if that answers your question, but definitely the schools definitely had extra pieces to support learning for sure that not all schools have. Right, right. And that's the one. That's why I'm Kind of guess what? I'm really looking at those schools that don't have that additional funding piece. But we can move forward. We can move. We can move ahead. Excellent. Thank you all my questions, Chair DePass. Thank you. So, just in the interest of time, I'll keep it short. Director Brim Edwards and Director Hollins asked the questions that I was interested in, and that was that really, what are we doing for the students that aren't making the gains? I know that we're in year two or three of the implementation, but it seems like an urgent issue that only 7% of our black students are proficient and the 93% are not. And then what levers do we have to. I don't know if I've heard what the levers are that the educators have to move the dial for those kids in an urgent way with a sense of urgency. This might be a good moment to talk about learning acceleration specialists, which I know we've spoken to you about before. Dana Narenberg's here. If we need more detail, I can give it a first go. But one of the very specific targeted strategies specifically for black students who are performing below grade level, is the infusion of the learning acceleration specialists into their classrooms. And the job of those folks, right, is to go into the core classroom during the core math block and support and scaffold black students whose data says that they're underperforming in that area to be able to access during the lesson that grade level standards align instruction. And so that's been really like that sort of a. That's more than an extra scoop, right? Like that's somebody right in there making sure that the lesson is sticking. Because it's one thing to teach the lesson, it's another thing to make sure that everybody's able to grab on and access it. So that's been an investment the district has made specifically in real time to try to bridge that acceleration gap. You're talking about. About. And this is a little. It's a weird question, but is there any data that shows, I mean, you know, sitting in a math class doesn't work for all students. Are there other, like, innovative approaches that you've seen in your, you know, looking around the nation that actually make math engaging? It's my favorite subject, so I love math, but, you know, that make it engaging and interesting, you know, can I call a resident expert, Director Hollins, to bring up the statistics about what we're actually measuring, Measuring apples to apples. But is there any, you know, hip hop math or something that Makes math relatable. If it's okay, I'd love to bring up our K5 Director of Math and Science, Patrice woods, who is currently embarking on A mathematics education PhD. You're the next contestant on the Price is Right. Come on down. I just, I really want to hear, you know, when you have a great math teacher that's excited about the subject that sees you, it makes a huge difference. So I can only speak from the K5 perspective, but it really just goes back to some of the professional learning that the teachers have had. So there's nothing like you mentioned a hip hop math or anything like that. So there's not like a thing that they're bringing in, but the professional learning that they're getting around, improving instructional practice and so really just making it so that kids are actually engaging in the discourse. They do have a plethora of resources available within the platform. Some of them are math games and some of them are like interactive tutorials. And so they, you will then interact with the games and the tutorials and there's like little characters in there so that the kids can actually, you know, have something fun to do. And so that's part of it, but there's nothing additional. But I do hear what you're saying and you're talking about something that might be more along the project basis lines. Thank you, I appreciate that. But I mean, I've actually helped out in my stepmother's 2 years old to 5 year old class, little kids with manipulables. And so I know even, you know, with statistics, there's manipulables. And I was just wondering also, you know, the percentage of our teachers of color that are teaching math that are, you know, engaging and interested and, you know, look like the students. So I'm just wondering if those, you know, what are we doing innovatively? And I don't know that any of those things work. But I think the other thing that we're doing is using our instructional framework that has the various parts so we have the grade level standards aligned. That's really what we're talking a lot about tonight and about how the curriculum uplifts that. But there's other pieces like deeply engaging and culturally affirming where we're teaching teachers how to take the lessons, study the lessons, unpack the lessons, and how are they bringing themselves into the lesson and bring their students into that. And so that's the next layer too, and we're talking about fidelity of implementation. How are we adapting the lesson without changing the grade level standard to Bring in these other pieces that include student and teacher voice. Right. These are all this is layers. First, we want to get them familiar. We want to get them practicing. It's similar to thinking about cooking, and you're like learning a new recipe. It takes a lot of time and a lot of at bats. Then we want to be able to bring in. How do we bring in these other pieces that really add this teacher element to it. Right. Can I ask then, how does that actually look on the ground? How does a culturally affirming math lesson. What does that look like? I don't know that I've ever experienced it myself. So one of the things, and I really appreciate that question because one of the things that we really try to reiterate is like, cultural affirming is not a checklist of things that happen that say, oh, yes, this is a culturally affirming lesson. And so one of the. So there's a lot of training that has to occur on our part as well as our leaders and our educators. And that's a question they're consistently asked. And I've been here five years, so consistently asking. And so one of the things is ways to engage with the kids. So one thing that does fit that mold, if you will, is getting to know your students. So bringing in things, like you mentioned hip hop. So bringing in question. I keep saying that because that's what stuck in my mind. I'm sorry, but bringing in things that are relevant to them, things that are important to them. So getting to know them, whether it's like a survey of, well, what kind of things make you, you know, buzz, if you will. And so those actually, within the iready lessons, the very early parts of it, there's inventories that they're asking educators to get this information from their students so that they can then use those to infuse in applications and whatnot, so that kids are like, oh, wait, we talking about cooking again, you know, those kinds of. Because those are things that kids enjoy. So that's only one small aspect of it. But like I said, I will tell you transparently, we don't have it nailed. But one of the things that we know is happening is that we are continuing to make sure that we have the learning behind that and that we're providing professional learning for our educators and our coaches, because they're asking all the time as well about that, because it can't just be this buzzword thing that we keep hearing culturally affirming or, you know, culturally engaging, culturally relevant, but it has to be Something that. Oh yeah, I've seen that before but it's not a thing, it's not a checklist. It's something that you live and breathe. I appreciate that, thank you. My turn yet? Yeah, my last name starts with W. I'm used to going last. Ollie, you kind of asked again. Part of benefit going last is everyone else has to ask my question. So yeah, I like that question about cultural affirming because it's a methodology, it's not a checklist. I mean it's like things like getting rid of deficit thinking or knowing your students relationships and it can be learned too, which is awesome. So I guess there's a lot of like higher order thinking or answers and stuff like that. And I kind of like to get into, into the nitty gritty, kind of see what it looks like day to day. So I'm going to ask kind of a day to day questions. When you're doing one of your, what's that called Observational walks and learning walks, what are some of your look fors and maybe if you can give some specific examples because I also have some look fors too. I'm curious about how you know what you know and how is that data being used. Right, sure. We can go grade band by grade band. For this one we actually have a very specific tool of lookfor as Christina just pulled it up for me so I can look right at it. In a K5 math lesson, we're first looking to see that they're on pace that they're within two weeks of our scope and sequence that we've put out so that we know they're where they should be. Then we're looking to make sure that the objective of the lesson is clear to the students. And then in the case of an iready lesson, we're looking for that try, discuss, connect routine in every lesson. So we're looking to see that the teacher is presenting that problem, that the students are first having a chance to dig into it and try it themselves and do that productive struggle that we talked about first. That should come before the teacher showing students how to do something. Students should be having connections with each other and in discourse with each other. We should see the tools and manipulatives that you were talking about, Director DEPass being used, whiteboards, resources that come with the curriculum. We should be. I mean one of the big look fors across everything is that the students are carrying the majority of the cognitive load. Right. The students are doing more work than the teacher. That should be happening in any lesson. And so we're looking at the way discourse flows in a classroom. Our students not only answering questions, but then are they building on each other's answers and asking each other questions, not just teacher to student. And we're looking for kind of scaffolds within a lesson. So for all the students you've been talking about, who you're worried may not independently be able to access it, our scaffolds built in is the teacher structuring ways that every student can access the task. There's more, and probably we could actually share with you our list of look fors at some point, if you're interested, but I'll pass to Joanna for middle school. Similarly, we're looking for use of the curriculum. We're looking for pacing, and we're looking for the instructional practices that support the implementation of the curriculum. As I mentioned before, one of the big components of med school math is that interaction and productive struggle. And so we really want, simply put, when you walk into a room, we don't want to hear the teacher voice exclusively. We want to hear discussion of math. We want to hear students challenging one another. And the conversation should largely be among the students. It's very similar at the high school level. I guess another way to say it is a look to see whether the learning targets are consistent with our adopted scope and sequence. So we have a. We've identified the learning targets that we want each content area to cover for each quarter. And so when I'm in a classroom and I'm observing what's happening in that particular lesson, I'm looking to see, is this consistent with what scope and sequence of those learning targets is I'm looking at? I'm interested in what the teacher is doing, but I'm much more interested in what the students are doing. So I'm assuming the teacher is the expert. I really want to know what are the kids actually doing? Are they talking to each other? Are they talking about their thinking? Are they asking questions? Are they engaging in mathematical routines and practices? And then I'm also really interested in assessments. So what do we want students to learn? How are we teaching them? And how are we assessing, broadly speaking, kind of the buckets of questions that I, that we think about when we're observing classrooms? And then we. When you use that app, whatever that I can't see right now. Well, the look for ones. Right. How do you use that data? I think you mentioned a little bit before, but I just want to. I don't know if you can give a specific example yeah. So I can give an example of how we're currently in the middle of a learning walk right now. And so what will happen after our learning walk is we're going to debrief as a team of a cross office team. So we have members of the, the school team, we have members of otl, we have members of Jay's team in student support services. And we, at the school site, we debrief with the building leader and the coach and we determine some specific action steps that's going to happen and how we can support centrally with that. At the central office site we're looking for. How are we changing our systems and structures? Right. How are we deploying professional learning support structure to schools? How are we working and wrapping around our senior directors of schools to support them in the building with that principal and that coach? Right. How are we changing our instructional coach professional learning that we have every other week based on the trends that we're seeing? How are we differentiating the supports based on the schools and the data that we're seeing? And so that's an example of how we're using that. We did have a work stoppage. Right. And so we're picking this model back up now. And so that's why it was really important that I shared our next steps because we're doing a lot of things now and we're being really intentional and being very data driven using this aligned tool that we spent a lot of time together centrally understanding and deeply calibrating. Even this week, yesterday we had calibration sessions where both the principal and the coach of the schools we were visiting as well as the central office leaders, they came and they learned how to use this tool, tool and deeply understand that. And we're going to practice that throughout the year because again, we need practice. We don't. It's not just one time. We're going to go in and use the tool and be able to say, hey, we're going to look at this consistently across the board. We need practice and support in doing that as well. Thank you. That's very good. Director Hollins, I saw your hand go up and down. Were you trying to get my attention or. Oh, don't. I don't think I did anything. Sorry. Okay. All right, well, we've had a lot of questions tonight. I'm just gonna throw a couple more. Seeing that this is the largest part of what we do, I, I do think we should probably move to move data up. I like having these kind of conversations, but I'm gonna be. I'M gonna be brief. Don't answer them right away because I'm gonna give you, like, three or four questions and then you can talk, and then we'll move on to the next thing. So you ready? Go. Here we go. We've been using, and I'm going based off of what I. What I heard each one of you saying that we've been doing this through K5 for three years, and we've been using it in six through eight for two years. And yet when I see the data that we just got, if we've been using this for three years, why does our data still suck? Our children are not. Are not doing it. We're far beyond the marks. So if we've been using this for three years, and I think you said 91% of the teachers are using it, then how does this support the data that Dr. Adams gave us? So that's one of my questions. The other question is, what? And I've tried to put it all down. You said 96% of the teachers are trained, but only 80% are using it regularly. And then you said that 83% of them are either on pace or mostly. Mostly on pace. So if they're trained, then why aren't we using it? And if they're not using it, then how are we holding them accountable for not doing what you're supposed to be. You're supposed to be doing? If we said that this is not an option and this is what. This is, what we need are the assessments that we're, that we're using, are they summative, are they formative, ongoing assessments? So the assessments that we have, are they summative? Just are they formative, ongoing? And then what do we have in place? And this will be my last one. What do we have in place as a. Because you said we're using iReady and that, you know, I ready is working well, we've also been using iReady for three years, and our data still sucks. So how are we. How are we pivoting? How are we doing something different? Because if this is working, then why are our kids still failing everything that we're talking about, that it feels like we're having an adult conversation. We're talking about adults. I'm concerned about the kids that can't read. I'm concerned about the kids that can't do math, and how long do those kids have to suffer? Or how many kids are we going to lose in the process while we're figuring out an implementation process that people can feel Good about. And I should say, miss my last question. Are we letting our parents know? Are we using in all our tools, are we letting our parents know that your child is failing, that your child can't read, and that your child can't do math? We're going to pass them to the fourth grade. But they're dumb. They can't read. So do they know that? Because I'm concerned about. We had all these people here tonight, and I want them to come out. I want people to come out. I feel like if people really knew the impact of their child is not learning and that they're going to graduate and be illiterate, that we would have a lot. We should have a lot more people in here more concerned about the data that we're seeing than we are whether or not they get an experience to Japan. Not that say, that one ain't good, but I am rating one over the other. I feel like literacy and being able to read and do math, we need to be telling our parents that and we need to be honest with them and we need to be up front, and it just is what it is. And then we have to hold people accountable to make sure that if you can't teach these kids how to read, then you don't need to be here. If you don't want to teach these kids how to read, then you don't need to be here because your job is to teach these kids how to read and do math. Period. And so those. The last one was a statement. Doesn't need a response. The other four were questions. And they do. Yep. I'll start us off. And I mean, thank you. First of all, we're all here because we believe the same thing you do about student achievement and where we want all our kids to be. And we know we're not there. Right. Like that. Nobody. We're all. We're all on the same page on that. So I don't want to make excuses for our data. I don't think that's helpful in any way. One thing I do want to say about elementary data in particular, that I just want people to keep in mind is that when we look at OSAS data, we're looking at the end of third grade, the end of fourth grade, the end of fifth grade. We don't test in standardized ways like that in kindergarten, first and second grade. Oh, I'm glad you said that. So at some point is there going to be. Because we wait, right? We're waiting for them to fail before we say, oh, so how do we have data that speaks to where they're at in first grade, where they're at in second grade, and then how we're monitoring that. And so now. Absolutely. So that's kind of where I was going. So a few things. This year's third graders are the first group of third graders that have actually had I ready since kindergarten. So just remembering that, that you can't just start a curriculum in third grade and all of a sudden be there if you didn't have the kindergarten, first and second grade baseline to get you there. So it'll be interesting. Right. This is our first group that's had it all the way through that they've been in elementary school. We do have our iready diagnostic data that we do give kindergarten through fifth grade three times a year, and that is that data. And Patrice could speak to this, like, off the top of her head. I know. But that data does show us three, three times a year that students are making growth in every grade level from fall to winter to spring. And that data is something that we could at some point share. If you're interested in kindergarten, first and second grade as a benchmark of where are our younger learners on the trajectory to getting to that third grade proficiency and then ultimately to the fifth grade board goal. Right. But I think it's really important to remember that in elementary school. I'll touch on a couple other points, and then I'm going to pass on. I'm going to leave accountability aside because that's not our role, but we're here to support everybody. I think one thing that Christina talked about earlier, we've all talked about is that number 96% trained. That's like 101 training. That's like, you know, what's in the box, you know, what a lesson is supposed to look like. Like, you know, how to find all the pieces. That's not everything a teacher needs to be able to teach with fidelity. The way Christina's been talking about that takes three to five years of professional learning and coaching and practice to really understand the art of how to use the curriculum to its fullest. Right. And we're just starting to hit that cusp in elementary school of being in a third year in terms of assessments, summative and formative. So built into our curriculum, there are summative assessments, like an end of unit assessment. There are also formative assessments that are checkpoints daily and throughout a unit to give teachers those immediate pieces of feedback about what did I teach today? Did they get it? And what do I need to do tomorrow. So there's kind of a full suite across the curriculum of all those pieces. And we hope and expect and have built into our scope and sequence that teachers are using all of those pieces and then bringing them back to their PLCs and data meetings for that reflection and planning. And in terms of how are we letting parents know? That's kind of the other question I heard in there. That's in my wheelhouse. We do our map assessments as everyone's talked about in third, fourth and fifth grade in elementary school. And those reporters do go home to families. And then we just revised our K5 report card and it just went out this first quarter as a first go with a lot of teacher input to ensure that that report card is really standards aligned. And we've also now provided teachers with really clear guidance on this is what you teach. These are the assessments in your curriculum, These are the standards on the report card. These are how you connect those dots so you make sure you're giving really accurate, data informed information to families on the report card. That's new this year. All right. For grade six, eight. We have talked a lot tonight about mid school math. I've shared with you our core curriculum that we have adopted and that is central in our instructional framework. And we also have presently a system that does allow for students to sort of skip over our grade level standards. And so this is a project, year long project. We're working on a proposal. We've been engaging with leaders, teachers, parents. We look forward to bringing forward this information to you as well. It's about a 45 minute in and of itself, diving into what we're doing, which is really answering this question. We do have students. About 48% of our students last spring were in an accelerated program, fewer this year. And so we're really looking at how does that serve our students, how does it not serve our students? How do we maintain an accelerated pathway while also really emphasizing that access to mid school math? And so part of the answer to your question is first and foremost we need to get our students accessing grade level standards aligned before we accelerate them. And really looking at the measures of readiness to then accelerate. The high school math curriculum includes both formative and summative assessments. Formative assessments being the quickly check ins to see how students are progressing. Summative being more kind of definitive assessments or student mastery. Teachers use parent view canvas as platforms or teacher view and canvas as platforms where they communicate to students and families where they are in terms of their progress and achievement. We're hoping to build on the work that our K5 colleagues have done with standards based report cards where we can become even more clear about not just what is the grade, but what are the specific learning targets that students have mastered or haven't mastered and need some additional support in so that the question that our students are asking is not what is my grade or what assignment is missing, but what is the learning target that I need to improve on? I think maybe the last thing that I'll just say is that in my mind this is about sustaining. This is about not just launching, it's about sustaining and deepening. We have a strong foundation of a shared understanding about what needs to be taught. We're providing meaningful resources for how to teach it. We have common assessments to assess and we have professional development to make sure that the support is there. When we say this is the second year of the implementation would mean last year was year one, we're in year two. Right? This, this is just the beginning. And the questions that you're asking about student achievement are absolutely appropriate and are absolutely the things that we need to keep focusing on. But these building blocks are the right building blocks. And so the support that we need is your ongoing reiteration that the core curriculum is the non negotiable is one of the non negotiables in the school district. Because we believe that every student in every classroom in every school deserves exposure to high quality instructional materials without exception. That's a foundational building block of the overall effort. I would say we need a longer court. So the one thing I'll add, because I just to reiterate, and because you talked a little bit, Director Greener, about accountability, and I do want to emphasize too that there's a reason that, you know, we rolled out an instructional framework which by the way is only in its second year, and where instructional priorities also center on teacher professional learning along with curriculum. Because curriculum by itself doesn't do it right. It's in conjunction with these other things. When you're talking about instruction, it is about assessment. It is about appropriate levels of formative assessment. It is about culturally affirming and having the relationships with kids. Right? That's what makes content relevant. We could roll out our curriculum, which is absolutely what we need in terms of grade level, standards, aligned curriculum. But we have to have these other things in place. And the fact that we're in our second year of an instructional framework, a tier one, everybody's getting this, really emphasizing that, centering PD around those pieces, I'm absolutely Confident and excited about what the results we're going to be having from accountability. And I like to say it from an expectation and a support piece and a coaching piece. I would say this too, right? We're talking about changing culture and system in a big system. And I think the, you know, we, there are going to be folks, they're going to do things because we tell them to do it. But if we want things to be sustainable, we have to set up a system where they believe and they want to do it. See, and that's the difference and that's what we're trying to do. I would say just like with it, you look at the PBIS triangle, you're going to get 80 to 85% of the folks are going to be there. It's that last 10 to 15% that we're really going to have to work with. And from an accountability perspective, we can go through it a number of ways. I would say very few, few are absolutely. We're not doing, especially from a math curriculum perspective, I would say that they're consistently trying. There may be on some continuums, you know, the ones that are absolutes. No, we're not doing it. That's a, that's easy accountability. That's a discipline type of piece. It's really getting folks to do things because they believe it and they believe this is the right thing for kids. And that's where the PD comes into to play. And I believe and as you can see from the survey pieces and where our goal was around 80% implementing this year and we're 100% next year, we are on track from that vantage point. I'm so glad that the board wanted to do a dive. You can substitute the content area because the theory of action is the same. So listening to the team tonight, all former principals, by the way, you know, it affirms my belief that there's a strong team in place to continue this work because it's nascent. It isn't just about unloading a packet of new material in the hallway. It's about learning to how it conveys and gives access to diverse learners to standards based teaching and learning opportunities. And that takes a lot of dialogue and opportunities for support and coaching of the educators as well as the school leaders. And now with the new feature of an instructional coach to take into account adult development and this work, I think to the essence of the question is how do we know that students are learning. The fact that we have elected to implement curriculums that have these diagnostics and embedded formatives in there give us a good sense of, you know, where growth needs to occur or where we're hitting the mark or where there's mastery in the performance tasks that students are being asked to work through. So the instructional framework is the right reference point to keep coming back to. I think they all mentioned it. That has served as a really clear anchor for us. You have all the senior directors are sitting over here. They supervise our principals. It's every measure of accountability requires that unit of support. And so working side by side with them, you heard the different mechanisms and the formats for being in our schools, Whether it's an instructional round or a learning walk or a visit to another school, or noticing across the school portfolio where growth is being accelerated for the students. We're most concerned about, you know, what's happening there, how do we keep replicating those best practices? So, you know, this is the work of school and district improvement that we're talking about here. You can substitute any content area you want. You should hear the same elements at play. Our challenge is how do we keep doing that with, you know, a concentrated group of district leaders and staff that are in the field supporting school schools every day so that they can get better at doing this work. And we do serve a diverse student body, and our educators don't reflect or represent that. So we have to work diligently in understanding not just the material, but what are those practices that are going to create engagement and access for our students. So we welcome the conversation today. We talk about it all the time. If directors, I heard you mention a couple times, you know, what does that look for? You know, what does that look like when you go to a school? What are you looking for? You know, we have to be calibrated and what it is that we're looking for. It shouldn't matter which senior director is your supervisor. They should all be asking you similar questions, just like when I visit a school. So I know maybe many of you have taken up the open invitation to join any one of us on school visits. We invite you to do that or join an instructional round or any one of the other format ways that we, you know, work with our school leaders to talk about these topics, because we're all growing in our understanding and ability to do it well. So thank you. Thank you, and thank all of you for coming out tonight and answering our questions. I appreciate you all so much. And let's. Let's keep working. Let's keep working. All right, with that being said, we are now going to move on to the Integrated grant agreement. On January 23rd, we're going to have a vote on the integrated grant application. And tonight we're going to get the opportunity to preview it before we vote on it in two weeks. With that being said, Superintendent, I would turn it over to you. Sure. You're going to learn about how the grant agreements align with the PPS Integrated Grant Plan that the board heard and approved this past March. It does include a couple key updates. Thank you, team. So presenting tonight, to walk you through some of those key features are Dr. Adams and our research and evaluation. Oh, making a special appearance, folks. Everybody, Leslie Odell is here with us this evening and is going to join this conversation. Thank you. Can I just. I just want to stop us for a second, just from a process standpoint. So we spent about an hour and 20 minutes on the math curriculum. Obviously it's very important and the board had a lot of interest. So we are. We were 40 minutes ahead. We're now significantly behind. I just noticed we have 10 minutes for this agenda item and 14 slides. And I don't mean to shortchange your work at all, but I also, my understanding is this is just agreeing to the agreements to the plan that we already passed in March of 2023. Am I is that accurate? There are a couple of elements that weren't presented in March that we're going to present here tonight, and most of them are with Dr. Adams. So I will expedite my part. So may I maybe just focus on what's different than what we already approved? Correct. Then we can move on to the rest of our very lengthy agenda that we still have tonight. That sounds great. So I'm Leslie Odell. I'm the Senior Director of Funded Programs. I'm glad to be here tonight. Again, we have the six integrated grants that were over a year ago ODE released. And you'll hear me refer to it as Integrated Grant, or ig. Tonight it is really getting a preview of the student Investment account agreement and so really highlighted reference grant allocations and really focusing on the new state evaluation framework. And so I won't read all of the grants, but there are six in the grant. I think you're familiar with all six grants included in the integrated grants. I'll move to the next slide which shows the key differences in what the final allocations were in March. We budgeted based upon preliminaries. We got final. And the increase, the roughly 5.6 million helped offset the decreases in high school success and a little bit offset in CTE and EIIs and they're high level. Keep up, you're going fast. Well, I said I was told let's go. So how are we going to go? So you know you're very well informed on the ongoing budget conversations that this integrated plan invests in focal student groups and schools based on need with an emphasis on improving culturally responsive site based learning experiences and our investments on align with key priorities identified in our needs assessment and priorities that were also expressed by our community. And while the strategies and outcomes for the plan will remain the same, the level of grant investments in specific activities will continue to shift in alignment with the district's budget amendment and the full plan is found on our website. And with that I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Adams to review the longitudinal performance growth targets that are required by ode. Sure. One of the reasons we're before you tonight is to review the evaluation and monitoring requirements of the Integrated Grant Agreement. For the first time since the COVID 19 pandemic, Ode has required districts to co develop longitudinal performance growth targets with them. These targets are statutory requirement based on what ODE calls the five cards common metrics. Those are on the screen before you third grade reading, ninth grade on track, regular attendance rates, four year graduation and five year completion rates. While they have similarities to our board goals, they are distinct differences which I will touch upon on this slide. There are notable differences between the required targets by ODE and our board goals for our students. The ODE required targets are come out of the Student Success act and they were co developed with ode. They focused on a supergroup of students called Combined Focal which includes, if I'm remembering, probably 15 different groups of students where we focus on specific students that are struggling based on race and ethnicity and the ODE targets are part of a statewide standardized evaluation framework. In contrast, our board goals are rigorous targets that have been set with board direction. They help us focus our efforts for student success on the racial groups most in need of academic support because we're trying to close those unacceptable and persistent gaps and they're actually aligned to our strategic plan. For each target there are three for each of the ODE required targets there are three different growth levels. The image on the right is a visual example of those targets. These are not PPS data and are for illustrative purposes only. There's the baseline target which is the minimal level of realistic growth that is expected of all students. There's a stretch target which is a more ambitious rate of growth, yes, still realistic for all students. And finally there's a gap closing target which focuses on reduction of academic disparities for a supergroup of students called the Combined Focal Student Group. This group includes and combines all students of color, students with disabilities, students experiencing poverty, students experiencing homelessness, migrant students, English learners, and more. While we appreciate the ODE creating the super group of students students, we're concerned that combining all these students will obscure and hide the achievement disparities among groups of students. Therefore, we will continue to disaggregate student performance in a way that highlights performance along the lines of race, ability and English proficiency. Staff did ask ODE the question, what happens when a district doesn't meet the longitudinal growth targets? And ODE responded to such performance will lead to conversations between districts and the state. That said, it's our hope that by focusing on our board goals and raising achievement for all students and our targeted students that are not achieving our Black and Native and Brown students, we will meet the target set forth in the longitudinal Performance Growth Targets. Those growth targets can be found on page 23 of the Grant agreement that was uploaded into the board book that's also in board and finally, if you're curious just about the five common metrics, the ODE Dashboard is a helpful statewide visualization tool. ODE does not include the required performance targets for each district on the dashboard, but it does report on the five common metrics for each district. The Oregon Schools Dashboard allows you to look at data for any school district in Oregon. The dashboard includes nine focus areas and those these include student and federal program demographics, English language arts and math, state assessment scores, employment projections, and the five common metrics. Within the charts you can hover over a bar to view the actual percentage represented by that bar and official state reports are linked in the footer of each page. You can also hover above the map of Oregon to the the right to view the data in presentation mode. And that link in the presentation is live if anyone is curious about that. And so these are the performance targets that we needed to share with you. And now Ms. Odell will close us out. Yep. And here you'll find the actual grant agreement not only on the board book, but also here in the presentation. You can link on it and look at the full package. And again we'll be back on the 23rd for approval. That was super helpful for real. It really was. Thank you. Thank you very much. Excellent. And thank you so much for all your work and coming out. All right, next we will move to the 2425 school calendar. We'll preview the 2425 school school school year before adopting the final calendar on February 6th. Superintendent, would you like to introduce this item? Sure. This is an annual exercise we bring before the board. So you have this memo from staff. It always tries to integrate a few features. There's a couple things that we have to refine each year. But Dr. Franco and Ms. Calvert can give you a quick listing of what some of those highlights are that are different in the proposed calendar. Can I just ask another logistical question? We got the memo, which I thought was very helpful in explaining all the criteria and what happened. And I would just ask the board if we're comfortable just asking any questions that we have after reviewing that memo. I'm definitely good with that. I have none. Great. I thought it was a great. It was a great. Oh, you haven't read the memo? No, I have read the memo and I have no questions. We get all the information very much ahead of time. We've all had plenty of time to read over all the documentation that is in board book about tonight's meeting. And I am absolutely sure that if my colleagues had questions, they are ready to go with those. So with that being said, are there any questions for them while they are here? None. I don't have a question like somebody on district student council just wanted me to bring up something. There are some people working at their school and they're looking into. Into implementing or advocating for a district wide SEL day, but they just wanted me to bring that up in regards to this conversation. I would still say I appreciated the memo that you're still doing outreach, given some of the just scheduling issues and working through. And I just really hope we continue. I know it's a compressed time frame to get this, but sounded like we've started that and are still doing that outreach to our staff and educators and communities. So. Yes. And we were going to use this as kind of a. Obviously getting some feedback if you had some, and then really amplify that level of outreach. Excellent. So I think there was some. The sel. If we could think about that. I don't know where they would fit or how it would fit, but that was a comment. All right, thank you. Wait. All right, go ahead. I've seen the calendar, so thank you for the materials. I'm glad to see we're following some of the best practices from previous years that are really student centered. Two questions, and I don't need to have them answered tonight, but it would be great to have them integrated into whatever we get when we finally approve it. The first is there's the one day ramp up for 6th, 9th and 12th graders. And I'm wondering if you. If you can just give us the grid based on this calendar, the high school instructional hours for each of the grades. And then the other thing that I would be interested in, just based on Director Scott's comment where he noted that you're still doing outreach with Pat and administrators and district departments. I guess if there's a material change based on that outreach, it would be great to know and have it called out when we get the board materials well in advance. Excellent. Thank you. Any other questions? Excellent. Thank you so much. And please get back to Director Brim Edwards as quickly as possible with your responses. Moving right along, we are going to now move to a update on the Southeast enrollment. So thank you. Next we'll have an update on the Southeast enrollment and program balancing implementation. Superintendent Guerrero, would you please introduce this item? Sure. And maybe Dr. Franco doesn't even need to come up because the board also has a multi page detailed update. So if there's any questions. I was just going to reiterate that unless there's something significantly different based on what we've had, and if there's board discussion that you would like to ask based on the information that we received, I want to open that up to the floor because I haven't. And so I want to. I want to. You know, the two Southeast people are gonna. For sure. Yeah, we could talk for hours on this. So what do you want to do? Because maybe we need a commitment. So then maybe I wasn't talking to y'all then. All right. No, not a separate meeting meeting, but go ahead. I don't have that many yet. Yeah, I mean, I just. I mean being part of the Southeast guy colony and this is. I mean, I just want to kind of focus on lessons in terms of like patterns I've seen in the Southeast Guiding Coalition. One of the things that I kind of wish for is because, you know, especially after the strike and we discussions about classroom sizes and that, and one of the patterns you really notice is that the over enrolled and under enrolled schools have very big problems with class sizes. And balancing is one of the few tools that we have, especially when we're looking at $10 million in cuts this year and another potential 30 plus million dollars in cuts next year, that one of the few tools we have for actually keeping class sizes manageable is proper rebalancing. And one of my wishes for the Southeast Guiding Coalition. And again, there's many things, factors going in and stuff like that that I don't blame anyone For. But I kind of wish it was a little bit more bold in the fact that I'll give you a real example. The schools that I hear a lot about, complaints about classroom sizes are like the ones that had the most resistance to change. Like, for example, like Kellogg, Dunaway, Llewellyn. Right. I'm talking about the Southeast and I'm kind of skipping ahead here, trying to respect time a little bit. One of the things is that I guess what I'm saying is like when we're trying to do a rebalancing, this kind of falls a little bit on us as a board is that we have to be kind of gutsy and really know. And keep in mind that this is about our kids. Right. It's not serving our kids any good when they're in an underground school. So like, one of the comments I want to make really quick is like, I don't know, I wasn't sure exactly why some of the schools were not included in Southeast Guyana Coalition, but right now we have issues with, for example, like when we don't include some of the most over enrolled schools, what happens is we just end up reshuffling a little bit of the slightly over enrolled schools and lower enrolled schools. And it doesn't. Instead of kicking the problem down 10, 20 years, we're kicking the problem down five years. We're going to probably have to look at rebalancing again pretty soon because I mean, Woodstock, for example, we're talking about no single strands. The kindergarten is a single strand now. And we're talking about Lewis, where you have overcrowded class sizes there kind of in the middle, things like that. Again, this is a lot of it has to do with COVID And again, I don't blame anyone for that. There's a lot of unforeseen circumstances that happened and we had to do this during COVID which was like probably the biggest hurdle. So I guess that's kind of what I'm saying is that when this comes up again, you know, make sure we keep our lessons learned and so that we can. And we also. I really, really want to reiterate that message that when, when we have people who are resistant to change, I know change is scary because you know what's worked for your kids and you don't want to lose that. But I hear over and over again the parents who, whenever there's consolidations or shading changes, parents who were really scared of change after enrollment balancing, usually come back and be like, oh yeah, we love our new community because you just joined a bigger, more thriving community. And I guess where I'm going with that is that we need to make sure we be very clear. Classroom sizes, I mean, classroom sizes are important and rebalancing is part of that. So I think, I guess my only feedback is that, you know, I hope that we have the guts to be more bold next time and do what's right and not be afraid to take on something a little bit bigger. Anyways, it's kind of weird. I kind of called it because I was expecting a presentation for first for me to kind of bounce off of. But. So I'm really sorry if I cut you. I made some of the points that you might have been making. But yeah, thank you. Thank you. Great. Thank you. And I just want to note this was an agenda item for November and that got deferred because the meeting ran late. And I think it's unfortunate for the southeast kids community because there were lots of school communities impacted. And I'm not going to make the board go through the whole presentation, but I do think it's important for the communities that. For them to know that the district is still focused on effective implementation and successful implementation. So it's unfortunate that we're late at night and rushed again. I will ask. I see in November, in anticipation of the meeting at that time, I sent a long list of questions about transportation, childcare, just enrollment and trends and whether we'd hit the marks or not. And I got a lot of lengthy responses and informative responses from staff. And I would ask, since we're not going to have conversation, that they'd be posted with the other materials. I thought that were very helpful and I really appreciate staff taking the time to answer them. I did have just wanted a couple things. I just want to make sure that in the discussion about transportation, there's guaranteed transitional bus service and there's transitional bus service and one is long term and the other is, I think, a five year. And I just want to make sure that I'm understanding the responses correctly, that the Lent neighborhood students who are now going to Marysville, who in some cases would have to cross 102nd, 92nd and 82nd, that theirs is not just a five year, but it's a busing pattern. Yeah. Thank you for that question. I'm Lisa Wheeler. I'm the transportation routing manager. You are correct. You've been waiting for my question all night. All night, literally. I've been here hours just waiting for this one. Hopefully you learn something about math that is a permanent change. And the entirety of the Lent attendance boundary is eligible for transportation. They are not expected to cross any of those roads. Great, thank you. And I had just a couple longer terms. Again, effective implementation. I think this really to Director Wong's point that sometimes people adjust to change. A lot of times effective implementation really helps that one of the issues I'm noticing just on the cost of daycare, which was a big issue for a lot of the school communities who are moving from a place that had daycare or didn't have daycare, is there's still some really high rates. Like I think one was $700 a month. And in school communities that that's not affordable and just as something to continue because like we can say it's offered, but if it actually isn't affordable, then it's not really available. And because we're moving sometimes people kids out of their neighborhoods, that's a really important thing to have and have it be affordable. I don't have any more transportation questions. So you're. So that would be a child care question. And then on their. The question around child care is around affordability. Yeah, just the trending. Because I say we can say. Because I noticed one of the questions I asked was about wait lists and there doesn't appear to be any wait lists. And it's also very expensive. And at school communities, communities that I know by those zip codes, that's not generally affordable. And I know there was some attempt to connect families with some subsidies. But I just. I want to keep that on our radar that that's an issue, an ongoing issue for parents in those communities. And then I also had a question about some of the sizing. So we looks like we added students and certainly opened Harrison park, which was the thing. So yay. That's great. However, some of the. Some of the schools are still. If you look at Harrison Park's numbers versus Kellogg's, there's still a pretty. Because the decisions were made some pretty wide divergencies. So there'd be another place that I would ask district staff to continue to look at because we want to set up Harrison park for success. And to do that, as noted, that you need to have healthy populations enrollments in order for that to happen. And the last issue I wanted to raise is also just a flag about Bridger Creative Science. So it's currently at K8, at 5, at 5, 16 students. And that's with some of the students in the modulars that were added I think six or seven years ago. And there's a new 124 units of housing being affordable housing being put in at 77th and division at 63 family units which is in the Bridger catchment. So I'm concerned that we've already got got an overstuffed school and then we're going to be adding in into that enrollment. We want more enrollment of students. But just to this issue of some schools way too crowded and this has been an issue with Bridger where the kindergartners had to move off site and then we had to add the modules. I'm just giving a advance warning that we're headed maybe in that direction as well. And then the last item just on effective implementation is I am wondering if staff is monitoring the like school climate surveys to see whether some schools have some very minor changes, but other ones had some very large changes. And we're looking at and just monitoring the school climate survey to see where we have places where bigger challenges or things that we might want to address in different ways. So that would just be my last thing. But again, just to not lose sight of, we still have school communities in transition in a pretty big way. And in response to your question, we have been monitoring the school climate surveys. We are aware of some elementary schools where it's been a little bit of a challenge, but it's been improving. As a matter of fact, I was at some of the schools today and we keep in touch with Bridger Creative Science as well because that's an area where we anticipated some of the school climate challenges, but there hasn't been any issues there. We're working avidly and quickly to try to resolve the facilities challenge that we have at Bridger right now with the space. Thank you. Just real quick, just want to express just immense appreciation to the board and then to of course the team. Obviously this started before I got here, but then to see the team, Dr. O. Claire Hertz, you know, obviously starting this immense process and then to see the folks we had, we had representatives here who now are very astute with math curriculum but they from transportation, from childcare, from facilities enrollment and transfer, they're all ready to talk and answer any questions and so just want to publicly just express thanks. I do see Dan and team back there. So if there are any questions. Yeah, I happen to go to Bridger Creative Science and helped in the cafeteria that time and they were really complaining about space like for their psychologists, social workers and it looked like the building is really old and having problems. So I suppose that's true all over the district, but how is that being addressed? So we did a lot of walkthroughs. We conducted a lot of walkthroughs and worked with construction contractors. They had a timeline for completion, but part of that timeline was delayed because the windows were back ordered so they had to wait. And then between that time also then there was an issue with the doors as well. But they have guaranteed that they will get the work done as quickly as possible. And Natasha is here to add the pieces to the information as well. Hi. Oh, I don't know which one of these is. Hi. Natasha Garcia, project manager, the office of, of operations and Safe Ross, school manager. Your question is about Bridger or. Excuse me. Well, the old Bridger site and Clark, there was a. There's currently locker room conversion space under the way, so we're converting those into office spaces. But as Esther said, there is a delay in construction. Yeah. There. I've sensed quite a bit of anger there. Yeah. Oh, well, yeah, I'm sure there is. Yeah. I just also want to mention, you know, there's, you know, obviously with redistricting, there's been a lot of positives that's also been coming out of this. I don't want to forget about those. You know, like the Harrison Park. I hear a lot of great things about what's going on there. A lot of things. So I don't want to forget that as well. Well, I do want to ask a couple questions. One is, is there any exploration about like other districts that maybe it's more normal to redistrict more often? Right. Like it's, it's more routine to kind of learn some lessons from, from other districts. And my second question is that now that, that we're well into the, the. The school year, would it be possible for maybe in the student success committee to get a list of all the, the middle schools and all the course and elective offerings to just kind of check to make sure that all the. I'm getting a thumbs up over there. So this is great. Just. Yeah, just make sure that, you know, we kind of have equitable access for all our kids. Of course, there'll be a few factors that weigh in there, especially our shift of 5 to 7. The addition of a number of elective specialist teachers as well. So that'll continue to fluctuate as well as well as the enrollment numbers at the schools also because we do know that Harrison park hasn't quite reached the target that we had for middle schools, but they will eventually get there. And you mentioned earlier, I think I remember that you're expecting Harrison park to continue to grow. Yes. Because of the. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you all so much. Thank you for your patience and, and for sticking it out with us. We appreciate all the work that you are doing. At this point. I'm going to move us in the agenda to our next item which is two policies. The first reading for two policies. And with that I will turn this portion over to Director Bredwards and allow her to introduce these two. The first is a first reading or an introduction of a new policy. In 2018 we adopted a policy relating to nepotism and we are going to. We were planning on adopting, creating and adopting a complementary ethics policy and we have have done that this year. So the, at the last committee meeting we unanimously recommended that the board we introduce this. Essentially it is a policy that translates statutory language relating to ethics into user friendly guidance for district staff and board members. It covers gifts, conflicts of interest, retaliation prohibitions and annual training. So that's the first policy it's been posted and if people want to comment, it'll be out for a 21 day comment period. The second policy that we're bringing to the board tonight and having an introduction or their first reading is a modification of our Public Contracting rules which is contained in Board policy. There were legislative changes made to the Public contracting code in 2023 and these policy changes align with the legislative changes. It's a 190 page policy. I know you read it all. Every bit of it. Every bit of it. So the changes fall into these broad categories so you don't have to read it. I can just tell you what they are then. They're recommended recommendations that come from the procurement team, updates to procurement thresholds, updates to align with the Attorney General's model rules, updates to reflect changes in pricing and buying power, removal of administratively burdensome mandates, and new and revised direct negotiation and special class procurement rules. Ideally, we will approve these after the 21 day public contract comment period. So we'll be aligned with current law at the first of the year. Not only aligned with current law, but also the AG Model Rules. The committee reviewed these changes and are recommending them out. There are also some other changes that were not necessarily ones aligned with that needed to be aligned with the new legislation or the HE's new model rules. And the Committee is going to look at those later this spring. So that will be coming back. But right now we wanted to get these on their way to being first read and hopefully adopted so that we will be aligned with current law. Excellent. Thank you so much. Director Brim Edwards. The policies proposed to be revised or rescinded will be posted on the board website and the public comment period is a minimum of 21 days. Please contact the contact information for public. Public comment will be posted along with the policy. The board expects to hold a second reading of these revised policies, which is a vote to approve them on February 6th. Thank you so much. And with that, I will move us on to the next next agenda item, which is our consent agenda. The board will now vote on consent agenda. On the consent agenda, the board members, if you have any items that you like to pull for discussion, we'll set those aside for the the next meeting. And I understand that Director Brim Edwards, you have one that you would like to flag before we, before we vote? Actually, I don't believe so. I think that's a L leftover. Fantastic. Let's move right along. But I do, but I do have a comment. Well, that's not at that point yet. Ms. Bradshaw. It was a mistake. Ms. Bradshaw, is there any changes to the consent agenda? No. Board members, are there any items you would like to pull? I don't have something I want to pull. I do want to just flag a future. I think we get the motion and then we. You asked me if there was anything. No, no, no, no. It was a mistake. You said it was a mistake. You said it was from the last day. So you. I said pull. So now do I have a motion and a second to adoption? Second. All right, with that, now let's open the floor for board discussion. Let's get it. This isn't discussion, but this week we have like six contracts that are on call and they're all not to exceed $3 million. And when we approve these, and sometimes some of them are certified businesses, we never know actually how two of them are, but we never know actually how much we at least it comes back to the board about how much is utilized off of that. So we could be proving like feeling good about like, hey, we have two certified businesses, but we don't ever see whether we actually what actually gets charged or what the on call usage is. And so just going forward and I don't know what form that is, but I would like to have some sort of look back so that we know when we approve these types of like groups of on call contractors who actually ends up getting the work. I can you. I can just say tonight this is the second time your comments are. I think that's great because we added that column. So now we know if there's a certified firm. And the next step would be to know what percentage of either the dollars we're spending are actually going to be spent in those communities. And it could be a matter of. I'm looking at Dan. It could be when we approve these contracts that we have. I'm sorry, it would be a look back, it would be an idea of what the percentage of total budget is that is spent in the minority and women owned communities. There's some smart people in the room to get paid a lot of money to figure out where it's supposed to go at. So would the board be looking for something semiannual at the end of each year? Quarterly. But some kind of a look back Quarterly. And a quick clarifying question, is that just for the on call contracts or is that for other contracts? Well, most rest of them it seems like the contract would be utilized. But the on call it the way it works it's like you know who's available, who might have the specialized equipment, who has the labor at that time. So that seems the place where it's most like it could be 100,000 or it could be 3 million. But they're all like written to be up to 3 million. But I'm sure we're not going to spend 18 million on whatever the services were that were on call. Yeah, I also have. So when there is a list of on call contractors, I don't know if PPS has a mechanism in which whereby they cycle through the list or if it's just simply based on availability who gets the contract. Because it's one thing to be on a list and it's another thing to actually be utilized when you're on the list. So before you kick it off, Director Hollins, I see your hand is up. I'd like to get all of it in and then you can answer one time and we can be good. Yes, I agree with director and director to pass. I think this is one of the reasons why the equity and contracting task force could have looked at this or can look at this exact question. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. A couple quick comments. As far as how contractors on on call are selected, it depends on the scope of work in the contract. Sometimes there is a mechanism where it basically just cycles through from one to the other. Sometimes there's mechanisms where everyone is invited to propose and so then you take the best option at that point in time. For ones like this, this was a hazardous materials abatement. It's more akin to who has the availability because typically there are projects that need to be done very quickly because we have other contracts or we have we're continually going through our program for hazardous material abatement. This is more for we need someone out there right away so who can get out there the quickest is for the most part these are there's exceptions to those rules. Purchasing contracting department does do the annual reporting on certified business and how the district is performing compared to goals. Be happy to talk with them. I'm certain that we could add a component to that about where we are with our flexible service contracts. I think that'd be easy enough. The data is certainly available. Great. Thank you. Thank you. The board will now vote on Resolution 6818 through 6823. All in favor, please indicate by saying yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All opposed, say no. Student Director Silverstein, please indicate your vote. Yes. Yes. Excellent. The consent agenda is approved by a vote of 7 to 0 with student director Silverstein unofficially voting yes. Excellent. All right. I will now move us along in the agenda and make sure I got to comments from our union partners. They're getting ready to come up. Our agreement with the Portland association of Teachers allows for patients leadership leadership to provide brief comments at board meetings if the leadership from one of our other labor partners wishes to speak. We welcome, we welcome that and we welcome you this evening as well. We ask that in the future that you would email our board manager, Roseanne Powell of your request and let us know who will be speaking with. That being said, I will turn it over to the Portland association of Teachers President, Ms. Angelina. I said Angelina. Watch out, watch out, watch out now. Angela Bonilla. Hello, my name is Angela Bonilla. I'm the president of the Portland association of Teachers. I'll make this brief as I brought one of our executive board members to speak on my behalf. But I just wanted to speaks a little bit to my excitement around the district's comprehensive audit coming out for the 2023 fiscal year. We had our researcher go through this audit and a few of the findings that we saw was the, you know, similar to some of the concerns we raised earlier. You know, there was the projected deficit but we ended with a higher fund balance than expected for the general fund. That relative spending on instruction declined again in 2023 compared to 2022 and that there was a continued increase in contracts as well as non instructional spending specifically around general administration, central administration and business support services. I am really looking forward to this next budget cycle. I feel like we really have an opportunity with as much community engagement, as we saw during the month of November, to push towards a budget that is just that reflects the priorities of our community, specifically around instruction and mental health supports and special ed supports for our students, as well as ensuring that all workers in our union in our district are able to be fairly compensated and able to afford to live and eat and be able to come to work here in our district. Because as other cities start going into their bargaining cycles, we're going to start seeing a lot of similar conversations happening across the state. And I hope that we don't have to have any more disruptions this year. So, you know, with. With some of these priorities possibly changing, I foresee the ability for this district to actually pay workers, especially our lowest wage workers in our partner unions, the wages that they deserve. The other piece is speaking a little bit more to what does it look like to repair the relationship between our unions and this district. There was a lot of harm done. And so. So I've asked, well, Greg Burrell, substitute educator extraordinaire, who has been here in PPS for multiple decades, is an executive board member of PAT and is here to speak a little bit more to that. So I'll pass it along to Greg. We'll do a switchero. Right. Good evening, everybody. Oh, here. Let's see if I can. There we go. So, good evening everybody and Interim Superintendent Husk. I hope you're listening. Usually I prefer to share my thoughts without a written speech, but this issue is a little bit possibly contentious. So I want to choose my words carefully. I have spoken with many of our Board of Education directors and PAT leaders privately and confidentially, and I feel the pain, anger and sorrow that so many feel about the state of our school district, our union and our school board. I have heard criticisms of actions from and about PPS and pat, but most importantly, I have heard a desire to heal and to do what's necessary for the sake of our students. For those of you who have received my recent emails but have yet to respond, I hope to hear your feelings about how the decision to change the holiday break with a few weeks notice may have helped impoverished families who struggle to find food and childcare, may have helped some students get extra help because so many of their more prepared, privileged peers were absent and provided some redress for us guest teachers who lost 2 or $3,000 in pay due to the strike. I would first like to thank Student Director Frankie Silverstein her remarks at the Board of Education meeting where we ratified the new cba. She said she's well aware the agendas of adults whose feelings are hurt can often wind up hurting students. Hurt people, hurt people is an aphorism I live by. So I would also like to thank every adult who suggested that there needs to be healing and said that they are willing to participate in that endeavor. Because today I'm here to talk to you about truth and reconciliation and restorative justice for all of our leaders. I'm not going to call out anyone for past behavior. Behavior. Remember the words of my late friend Noel McGinnis, forgiving is giving up all hope of a better past. I want to remind you that the most well known case of truth and reconciliation happened during the presidency of Nelson Mandela under the leadership of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Men and women who have spent sometimes decades killing each other and each other's families found healing and forgiveness as a result of simply telling the world what they did to their enemies. Since no one on any side of our conflict died or was seriously injured as a result of actions taken during the strike, it should be comparatively easy for people to forgive each other for what was done in the strike in the run up to it. But after more than three decades of budget cuts, reforms followed by a great global pandemic, our district is reeling even without the sudden departure of our superintendent. In fairness, the nature of divisive politics, crony capitalism, and unfunded mandates from our federal, state and local government right down to this very school district have set the tone for conflict. In such a world, honest disagreements are difficult to resolve. We use our power to enforce our desires rather rather than look for dis difficult and elusive consensus. Changing the culture of PPS to allow for true stakeholder dialogue will take a process that involves the interim superintendent and will require an appropriate choice for the new superintendent. However, it will also take a disinterested police, a disinterested peace leader. It's very late. Sorry who can bring healing to each party separately? If conversations between the parties are to be healing and productive rather than continuations of entrenched behaviors, I'll be honest, I would hope to be that leader. At the same time, I'm aware that choosing someone who has the global respect and impeccable credentials of my mentor, Dr. Sharif Abdullah, would help facilitate the process of changing the culture of PPS and PAT as necessary. I want to highlight my communication with Director Scott, which I will also share with the rest of you. I mentioned a book about changing corporate culture called Building the Bridge as yous Walk On It. As important as healing and restorative justice are to this process. It will also be vital to choose a superintendent who is skilled at bringing such cultural change. I want to close by sharing Dr. Abdullah's primary values. Inclusivity Fundamentally, inclusivity is the idea that whatever we think we're doing to the other, we are also doing to ourselves. Practicing inclusivity includes identifying those that each one of us considers to be our other, that person or group that we believe we must oppose, then figuring out how to make a more productive choice. This, to me, is the two pronged approach we need practicing inclusivity and creating cultural change in our institutions. I'll share more details about these ideas in writing, but I wanted to take the time to address you in person about the need, the process, and the potential outcome of healing our collective trauma. Thanks for your time and attention. Thanks for being here. It's yalls turn. Sorry, let me pull it up. My name is Veronica Green. I work at Bridger Creative Science. Last month when I spoke at the board meeting, I invited every board member to help in my kitchens since we would be working short staffed. Only two of you responded and those same two showed up to help. While help serving in the kids was the reason Andrew Scott and Patty Sullivan came to Bridger Creative Science, a lot more happened on those two days. Both days started with introductions and asking about each other's families and backgrounds. They were both very pleasant people that in another world I think there wouldn't be such a divide between us. Later, more important topics came up. I asked a lot of questions, especially with Mr. Scott, and he asked me a lot too. I learned things about the district and how they make decisions and why certain things are run the way they are and that's always helpful to know the whys. See, I think they heard the things I had to say too. For example, the real impacts that the Southeast Guiding Coalition has had on me personally and my daughter and my family and my school community. I think if you really want to know the climate of what's happening with the Southeast Guiding Coalition, you should ask the staff and families because it's not good. Also, I why I think bargaining has been going on for a year and what I think PBS could do to bring it to a close. But the statement that stood out to me the most was something board member Scott said and I wholeheartedly agree with we have to start to build back trust between PBS administrators and board members and and PPS employees and all the unions and it's going to take years. One thing I did not expect from having board members in my kitchen was the pushback I received afterwards, I was happy to report that I thought it went well and we opened up an important conversation. But I had a lot of people say things like, you know, everything they said was a lie. We can't trust them even if they express that they want to work together. They only showed up so the public could see. I actually took this really hard, harder than I expected. And I think that was because I had this crazy thought that perhaps this was the first teeny weeny, tiny step in building back that trust. I saw a glimmer of hope in the distance. I thought that maybe if we start by getting to know each other on the most basic human level, we can start to repair the broken relationship between us and you. We may still never agree and still fight, but maybe we could do it with a little more understanding and empathy. I want to be clear. Things are not magically better. Andrew and Patty are not my new besties. But. But I know that I want to be a part of the good fight. I want to be part of the solution and not the problem problem. And it's because I want the best school district possible. One that produces happy, healthy and educated students and a workforce that feels valued and respected by the district they worked. They work for. How do we begin to repair this relationship, you ask? Well, I happen to bring a list of where we can start. Basic things that can be changed immediately and then perhaps that will show. That will show if the board actually means it when they say they want to work with us. So number one, please don't put union comment at the end of board meetings. And yes, I know that you all have to get up early too, but at the end of the day, aren't we all here for the students, the board and us? If you all actually are, then you would want a student to put us earlier on the agenda because you know that we have to get up so early to literally serve our students. You don't. You may have other things and I respect that. But right now we're talking about showing up at school. Two, make sure your PPS bargaining team and the lawyers that you pay a pretty penny for show up to the table with intention and counterpart proposals. Three, which I think is the most important, make the time to get out and into the schools. See what the student facing workers do all day and hear about their struggles. Ask them questions, tell them about yourself. Roll up your sleeves and help wipe tables or read a book to the littlest students. Get to know the parents too. Stop into this bedroom and see what is really going on in there. And don't bring cameras or the PPS posse. Don't wear a fancy suit. Be low key and genuine about it. Hire a superintendent that is engaging and interested in building these relationships too. Talk to district administrators about doing these things too, because it's always such a divide in this room between everyone over here and all of the union partners. Work for us and with us, not against us. We can do that too. Listen to what the community wants because it's their district and their children that are attending pps. When we can see changes like these, then maybe more of your employees can see a pathway forward and you can too. Then maybe we can start to have the adult conversations that are needed to achieve our shared goals of having the best district possible. I know that's what I want and that definitely sounded like what Patty and Andrew wanted too. That and to wrap up bargaining so our members can get the pay and working conditions they deserve. Good evening. My name is Elizabeth Held and I'm the interim president of pfsp. As our bargaining unit has prepared for our first mediation session in a little over a week and a half, I've had a number of members reach out to me to tell me why it's so important to them that we get a fair contract settlement. I want to share one with you tonight. She would have been here herself, but the timing of the board meetings make it difficult for her to attend, she says. I have been a para educator with Portland public schools for 12 years. I'm at the top step of the pay scale. Every winter my electric bill skyrockets despite the fact that I keep the thermostat at 60 degrees and wear many layers when I'm at home. My December retention bonus, which would have been 1500 before taxes, is how I paid my electric bills over the winter months the last two years. This year we did not receive it and rates are increasing 17%. I'll be seeking support through heating assistance programs. However, it can take several weeks to get improved in the program. The whole time I've been a para, I've worked odd jobs in the evening house cleaning, home organization, childcare, pet sitting. I'm trying to pick up more work this month, but it's not enough to pay the bills. In the meantime, I did a deposit bottle deposit drop on the Buy Nothing group. I'll pay my electric bill because of the kindness of strangers, not because I make a living wage. I also discovered I'm eligible for food assistance through the Oregon Food Bank. This is comforting, but also infuriating because I have a college degree, steady employment history and 12 years of experience under my belt. I should be able to pay for food and electricity, but this month I was not. We need a contract that will allow all members to feed themselves and pay for essential bills. Our students need a staff who aren't exhausted by working second or third jobs to make ends meet. Students deserve our attention and our members can't do that when they work to the bone. And our members need jobs where they're treated with respect. The pay is important, but they've also come to you time and time again about the importance of safety and training. In a regular year, our employees would be offered professional development on the three main year PAT grading days. Because of the work year calendar changes, these grading days are now on non working days for most of our bargaining unit. I don't know how we can say that we have under the under trained staff going out into schools and classrooms and call that being student centered. We want to prioritize our students. Our students deserve staff that have these core trainings. It keeps students safe and it helps them be successful. When I come to you and I say that we need Portland Hooks Schools as an employer to show you that we value the dignity of our labor. I mean, we need a contract that invests in our workers, that invest in compensation so that we can afford to work here and in training so we can keep ourselves and our students safe. Thank you. Hello. It's been a while since I've been in front of this board. My name is Kelly Bond. I'm the vice president of the District Council of Unions and a business representative from for IBEW Local 48. First thing I want to say is congratulations to Pat and to the school district for finally settling a contract. I'm sorry to see that it went to a position where our PAT personnel had to go out on strike and had to work so many hours with both sides to try and come to a resolution. My hope is that seiu, PFSP and DCU also don't have to take those drastic measures that we can come to an agreement more quickly. I can't speak for what's going on with PFSP and seiu. I do know that they are going into mediation. I am saddened to hear that that's happening. DCU unfortunately did not get an opportunity to go to the table until very, very recently and we are already working without a contract. That's disturbing to me. My hope though is that with positive ground rules that we've already come to an agreement on and some articles have already been passed across the table that we can work together amicably and get to a quick resolution and get our contract issues resolved very quickly. One of the light moments I'd like to share with you is that I can appreciate all the math that happened today because being a member of District Council of Unions, we're very trades oriented, which means we use a lot of math, algebra, trigonometry, geometry and calculus. So I was excited to see the enthusiasm all around that. Yay. I do want to discuss a little bit about the issue with the strike that happened and how it's affecting dcu. You've had an opportunity to hear students speak up how the change in the school schedule has affected them and is affecting them. We've heard it from some of the other members, but a lot of you aren't aware that Maintenance Bureau, our maintenance group here, which is the District Council of Unions, is a year round employee. And as such, when the teachers are out of the classroom and PFSP is out of the classroom, Nutritional Services is probably still around some and I know the custodians are as well. But when those people aren't in class, that's when our members go to work. That's during Christmas Exodus. That's during spring break. That's during the summer. And with having a week taken away from our maintenance crew, a lot of that work had to get deferred. They didn't know where things were going to settle out. So some of that got deferred to spring break. Now what's happening is that the district is using March 25 as the substitute day off and our members are going to have to work or may end up working on President's day, which is February 19th. For our particular group, that's a little frustrating. Our members could take that paid day off. They could schedule a skeleton crew to be available or an emergency response crew to be available and still meet their requirements during the spring break of all the work that they had to push out. Or you could even fulfill our contract. Ask our members to work on February 19th and also work March 25th. Just pay them appropriately. It's allowed for in the contract. I just wanted to bring that to your attention. Our members want to serve our teachers, our para educators, our custodians, and our nutritional services people as best they can. They're all here about the community and about taking care of children because they are part of the community and those are our children as well as the parental community's children. This is a village so with that being said, I could probably go on for quite a while longer. But I know we are all tired and we're ready to go. So I want to thank you for your time and I appreciate what you do. Please show that appreciation back to the employees that work in the school district. Thank you. And thank you all for coming out and sticking with us this evening. Okay. With that, I believe that's it. This meeting is adjourned. And the next regular meeting of the board will take place on. What day is that? The 23rd. The 23rd. That's what I thought. On January 23rd. Good night. Drive safe. We are done.
