A: Okay, we're going to go ahead and get started. I don't think we need to do introductions. We have the full committee here and also board chair Wong and also board member Scott. Do we have any public comment? Nope. Okay, great. All right. So the first item on the agenda is our cell phone policy. And we for the last several meetings have had a discussion about the draft and various issues related to or potential elements in a cell phone policy, including the. The just draft we were using as a somewhat of a straw man. And we also have had in the field a student survey. Is it out yet? I think it should be out.

start time: 19:29:50.000

B: I think they are going to be. I don't know if they have happened and that's speculative on my part. I actually don't know the dates of the focus groups.

start time: 27:23:20.000
end time: 40:25:24.000
confidence: 0.96
A: And we will have Dr. Dr. Adams presenting at the October 15th, 21st. The meeting on the 21st. Yes, October 21st. So we didn't want to move ahead with more changes to the policy or get too far down the road without getting student feedback. So on the 21st we should have both the focus groups from the schools that currently have, I would say an enforced school wide policy and also the results of a survey. Jj, were students taking the survey or did you see evidence of it at McDaniels?

confidence: 0.95
A: And I see that Director Hollins has also joined. Only Director Green is missing. Okay. So since the last meeting and as a way to continue to move things forward between now and when we get the student feedback, we gave all board members an opportunity to share their thoughts on core elements and in some cases core elements that shouldn't be in the policy. And so we have. What we did is we put together a consolidated list of that of all the ones we received up until I think yesterday. And that should be posted at least in the board members books. So we have it consolidated. And what we tried to do is Liz and I's go through and find the common themes of core elements that were either in that people wanted to see in a district policy or that were in the draft sort of committee strawman. And from that we have a document that was sent around to everyone from Last night that is titled Annotated Draft and it has one that's got the highlights on it. So try to put together sort of what would be described as sort of six different categories. And from the six categories are breadth of policy decisions, scope of restrictions, nature of exceptions, consequence for student misuse, districts support and then required compliance information. And I'm just going to dispense with the last one first because I think that's the easiest. It's the one that items that district council says we need to have in the policy to have it in there. So I think that's the easiest one.

confidence: 0.93
B: It's from ORS 336.840, which is that requires certain components in a policy about the use of personal electronic devices.

start time: 91:43:40.000
end time: 93:03:48.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So we'll share it around. But it's less of a sort of.

start time: 93:06:04.000
end time: 94:39:16.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Policy but more it was in the last draft the policy committee looked at when we had the draft discussion.

confidence: 0.84
D: Draft exemptions.

start time: 95:07:48.000

A: No, no.

start time: 96:10:20.000
end time: 100:12:00.000
confidence: 0.96
B: There are parts of the exemptions are also satisfying that statute. But we thought those were in a different group. They needed to be grouped together in section three. But that so that is also compliance related language to be fair.

start time: 101:10:30.000
end time: 146:54:20.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So for the other categories going through them and looking at what would be items that would be more likely to be in policy at a high level and then those items that would be more likely to be in an ad because they were operational more detailed or the nature of it is that they could continue whatever the issue could be a continuously evolving issue so that it's changing and you don't want to be, you want your policy to be more I don't want to say timeless because nothing's timeless but more time durable. So if you look through the document you can see where and again this is, this is for discussion the items that would be again higher level policy and then those would be ad. And then a third category would be either not necessarily in policy or in ads. I mean the example I'm going to use the general tools and processes for parents to reach students and students contacting parents during the school day day. So that would really be around, you know, you have a phone available for students in the office or you know, parents have a actual, you know, there's hours that they can call and get a person if they need to contact their student and get a message to their students. But those wouldn't be something that you'd like dictate in a policy or put an ad, but would be how a school would operate operationalize it. So those are the three categories and we can just start with the very first one which is the breadth of the policy decision. And to me this is the probably the biggest one which is the district setting some sort of restriction or minimum standard. And then the other would be actually currently what we have now which is schools restricting at their discretion. So essentially not a district wide policy. So I just open it up if people have points of view.

start time: 147:00:40.000
end time: 149:45:00.000
confidence: 0.99
E: I definitely think it should be district wide. Personally I'd love it to be all day, but.

start time: 149:52:40.000
end time: 156:43:06.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Well let's, let's hold that thought to the scope of the restrictions because this like the district restricting. I think we're starting like at a minimum with a class like during class, like having a single standard. You can or Michelle, anybody jump in. This is on a committee. It's more unstructured.

start time: 156:44:58.000

D: Go ahead.

start time: 157:50:26.000
end time: 169:02:30.000
confidence: 0.94
F: And I'm getting a weird feedback. I don't know if anybody else is getting that I would be in favor of restricting like providing a minimum to the district with schools having the discretion to be more restrictive. And that said, I do like the all day policy because of what we heard from Principal McGee in that the poor behavior is showing up during passing and lunch times. And so if part of what we're trying to solve for is know bullying or bad behavior those times that I would think all day off and away would be my preference.

start time: 171:32:10.000
end time: 226:37:10.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Yeah, I just want to share something that a teacher at Benson shared with me saying that I'll just read a couple quotes here and there saying that now they have an off and away policy in the classroom. It's still allowed in the hallways and during lunch. He said for the most part in the classroom things are okay. However, outside the classroom is a different story. Students are all over the halls with cell phones out, sitting on benches, walking down the hall, which means they're not in class, they get restroom pass and go sit on their phone in the halls of cell phone policy is almost impossible to enforce. There's not enough security to really help and most teachers are teaching and the ones who are available are planning really quick. So yeah, I mean my preference is all day. But I think my. The big thing I prefer to push is that currently if there's some kind of policy that's not very not mandated, it's a values or a goal and maybe for this next year how it looks and how it enforces an all day policy. Like all day, if that makes sense. Like for example, in medicine, practices are always being updated. Right. Bloodletting was cool. 100 years ago, but it's not so cool today. There's no policy that says no, no bloodletting. It's a goal saying that we will continue best practices. Right. And so I got two components. One, I would prefer a policy that says something like we need to take account the best practices that is shown either through the district or nationally, what the evidence says, and the evidence is pretty strong. For example, I'll give you an example. If through Grant using yonder and Lincoln is using the lockboxes, we discover that Lincoln's lockboxes are just amazing and student scores are going up or their performance is going, are doing better. And there's seems like there's mental health and even anecdotally teachers are having, you know, the feedback from teachers is overwhelmingly positive. And that is the best system. Right. Maybe it's not yonder pouches. Then we should, then my thing with the policy is that then all schools should have access to that best system. Right. Because the problem I think we're facing today with a lot of schools is that a lot of schools, a lot of principals have stated that they felt like they're on their own. So one school might get one thing and another school, they can't afford that thing, so now they have to do something else. And that I think that is where I would, you know, like, I prefer a policy to kind of solve for a statement of values, like for example, equitable practices. Right? Yeah. And so I know I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but you know, like one of the things about, you know, what if someone comes up with an amazing technique three years from now, you know, like for example, an app that uses AI that turns off people's phones when they're not supposed to be using them automatically. Right. We could use that. So like, you know, a policy needs to. That's kind of where I'm at.

start time: 226:51:40.000
end time: 246:31:20.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Just making a few thoughts on that is that that's more of the how. So the concept is we know students are more focused on instruction and more engaged in classroom. When they're using a phone, that's like kind of the what. When they're not using phones or electronic devices. The how to me is like what you're talking about is like that's what I was referencing. And things evolving is like you have leave that to the staff to like to adapt. It's like, oh, there's a brand new technology that, you know, allows for, you know, some much easier way to enforce the what. But you don't, you wouldn't put it in policy. Because the timeless thing is, like, we're not going to have electronic devices generally in classes. And the how piece, which will continue to evolve, seems like. Or the best practice that could be. That's more operational and could be in the ad and so you don't have to change it every time.

start time: 246:49:40.000
end time: 267:22:18.000
confidence: 0.93
D: Yeah, exactly. I mean, that was my point. It's like. Yeah. So thanks for reiterating that. The how should be easily adaptable and therefore shouldn't be in the policy. The policy should be a value, a goal. Right. Something that. And also enforceable. You know, like, for example, if there was a policy that said something like, you know, district shall practice best practice in terms of smart devices in the scope of mental health and classroom management, teacher workload and student performance, and ensure that that practice is equitable through the whole district. Right. Then let's say, for example, we have a situation in the future that, you know, let's just say yonder pouches were. The results were amazing with that. And Benson can't afford yonder pouches. We should never have that kind of situation again. I'm just using yonder as an example. I'm not saying it's the best. Maybe Lockbox. Maybe AI is the best or Skynet, or. But yeah, I think. Yeah. So thank you. You kind of iterated exactly where I was going with that.

end time: 296:28:10.000

H: Well, I was going to agree, actually, Director, with your point. I mean, I think the question I keep asking on each one of these is, like, what's policy and what's not? And just to, you know, even, you know, I really appreciate, because I'm hearing also from, you know, administrators and teachers saying, oh, this is really hard to implement. Personally, I don't think we're going to solve implementation issues through the policy. I think implementation issues will be solved through an administrative directive, you know, at the district level. And they're important, for sure. But I think, you know, and I'll give. I'll give an example. Right. We could pass a policy that says the district, the superintendent or the district, however, you know, will minimize the use of cell phones during the day. Or we could pass a policy that says the district will prohibit the use of cell phones during the day. Those. Those will result in very different administrative directives. Right. And you Know, and so that's the value statement. Are we trying to minimize it? Are we trying to say, hey, you know, we recognize there's going to be some uses here and there, but you know, students can use it in the hallway, the bathroom, you know, lunch, whatever, or are we trying to say, you know, no, there's nothing. Obviously the exceptions, you know, that are listed would come into play, play. But I feel like, like, like that's where I would want to focus our time as a board. You know, what are we trying to say from a values perspective? And we can do that pretty quickly. And then I think the administrative director is going to take some time in terms of how, you know, how it actually gets implemented in the schools.

confidence: 0.95
A: Okay, sorry. I actually think this could be less than a one page policy with a much longer administrative directive. And you know, I think about the administrative directive, it's like we're trying to recreate the past in some ways of, you know, how do you support students who don't have access to communicating with everybody? But obviously we did it for 70 or 80 years, so I'm sure we can figure it out. Gary or Director Hollins, do you have anything generally on this very first broad topic about whether we should have a district wide policy or essentially leave it to the schools?

start time: 311:13:10.000
end time: 332:14:30.000
confidence: 0.92
G: Thank you. I'm getting an echo too. And then we do a district wide policy and like what Derek the Scott was saying, if we, we are going to prohibit, then we need to be able to have resources to assist our principals with that. If we're going to say we're going to basically minimize it, then it has to be something that has a district that we can do across the whole, all the schools. And I think we need to be clear as well. If we have a policy that vague but not concise and direct, then I think if I make sure I heard right, what Dr. Scott was saying, Director Scott was saying was that you're going to have different implementations at different schools for different principles. And I don't know what's the difference that they're doing now versus what we're going to pass if it's vague enough to where they can make their own decisions Anyway.

end time: 354:40:10.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Sorry, Gary, I didn't know if you're done. Yeah, you know, I, I think the, the way I think about it is, is, is that feels like, like if we say we want to prohibit cell phones during the use of school Day, with a few exceptions, then my expectation would be the superintendent will draft an administrative directive that does that in schools throughout the district. I think what I'm hesitant to do is. And actually Eddie, you've been making this point like you have to do it in one particular way. Right. Because it's possible that for whatever reason, because of the particular student body or the particular school or the configuration, you know, the administrative directive may allow some flexibility in terms of, you know, how it's done. But, but I wouldn't expect there would be a difference in terms of the outcome. So the means of getting there may be different. Or, or maybe not. Maybe the superintendent says hey, we're going to have one standard. We're gonna have one way to do this. It's gonna be consistent across the district. As a board member, I don't want to be making that decision for the entire district. I want to be saying here's our high level principal. And then. Or value principle gets confusing. Here's our high level value. And then, and then let the, let the district staff sort of figure out the best way to implement it so that we have that consistent outcome in the end.

start time: 355:27:50.000
end time: 379:27:22.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I think we have. Nobody said we want to continue to have all of this just said at the school level. I think what I've heard is a consensus that a sort of district wide floor. And then maybe the second piece I'm going to go into, what I think is maybe the easiest piece would be just like class time, sort of like the. This restriction that like in class. In classes electronic devices. And we're going to get the exceptions later so we can. This just in general, the district. Think about a district wide policy. What, what, what is the policy? Because we're. If we set again this from, from my perspective like in class is setting the floor and then when you continue down into the scope of restrictions, then you have a whole. You know, you could have a higher floor. You could be adding a couple stories. Does anyone knowing that we're going to get to exceptions have an issue with class time being a time in which we're saying no electronic devices?

Because I do think that's when we're going to start seeing some differentiation and it will also. That'll be when we get beyond class time. It'll also become a time in which like how it Gets implemented could be very different and lead to different outcomes. Jj, do you have a point of view either on the. And I'm sorry I didn't call on you on the. If. Do you have a point of view on the district wide versus individual schools setting the.

A: That's what I'm trying to establish. Yes. Okay. I think I've got a consensus. Okay. So we're going to. And I think this will be. We should maybe have people share where they are on each of the. These next. The first. At least the first three. And then we maybe share where you are and then we can have a discussion about it. And I'm going to dispense with the. On the last. The last one. Use of phones for photos, videos, complies with PPS policies. We frankly just have a reference in there. So people would know that if you're using your phones, if it's allowed at any point in time, that you still have to comply with the district policies. Again, that's probably like a one sentence reference to the other. The other policies. So you have everything in one place. So does anybody want to start with their point of view on the three. The three options? Because we can just go there and see how much agreement there may maybe. And you don't have to have a position if you don't have one already.

confidence: 0.97
A: Yeah, yeah, sure. So the very. It's school hours versus school activities. So that would be sort of beyond the school day. But if like if you're still on school grounds. That's the first one. The second one is passing time and the third one is lunchtime. And I think you can have a point of view and a point of view could be. I think this should be set in the ad. And I'll just start with. I think it should be set in the ad.

end time: 456:03:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I would leave that to the, to the superintendent, to the district staff because when we get down into sort of like the supports, there's. I have not heard a consistent. And again, this is also, I will say if we're saying that they're restricted in the classroom in the policy, but schools may choose to have more restrictions than the flexibility. To me, that allows a school to say it's not a passing time and not a lunch.

E: I have heard the teachers ask for something strong from us. It is not strong. If we say, oh, you know, you can either do just classroom or you can do all day, then they're going to have the students saying, oh, you don't have to do that. And we're going to rebel against that. And I think we have to be courageous and say, hey, that's it. I mean we know. Well, we don't know for sure. I mean maybe all this research is wrong. We know what the teachers are saying. I think we just have to be strong and say no, no cell phones during the school day, 8:00 to 3:00, whatever it is. And you keep talking about a floor. I think the policy should say that then. There's no floor policy. It's strong.

start time: 473:40:50.000
end time: 477:18:40.000

D: Yeah, sure. I mean something we were saying before, I just care about the end result practice that's being held. So I guess here's my issue, right? Like there's already growing body of evidence that's strongly showing that there's an increase in student performance when schools do have all day bands and the growth, the increase in student performance is especially stronger among the lowest performing kids. And again it's. I wouldn't. Maybe it's definitive by now, but it is definitely A growing body of evidence if that's true. Right. In our board goals specific state. Right. We are trying to increase performance especially among the groups that are historically been disadvantaged. My point of view is that if this is showing that this works. It is for me it's almost like a moral obligation that we need to at least do something get us closer there. So, you know, I'm in support of Patty in terms of an all day band. One of the issues I know as a former teacher, the more complicated you make it, the more difficult is it enforce. Right. In terms of classroom management, when I have roles in classroom they say limited to three because that's about the attention span of the average human. And when it gets too complicated like oh, you can have it then but you can't have it now. And that's when you get into enforcement issues and trouble. And the teachers have been overwhelmingly asking we need help with this. Right. Having teachers enforce a policy has been difficult. It hasn't been working. And so to, to kind of let that keep going is almost, you know, not responsive. Not being responsive. So I guess, I guess my point is that I'm not sure if I'm for a policy that specifically says that we need to ban it all day during class hours. I mean maybe that is the way. But you know, I'm more into a policy that says like we need to follow best practices. Best practices are showing that this is working way better than that. Right. An all day policy or school policy is better than oh, you can have it during lunch and passing periods. And so whatever we pass, I think as long as the end result results in schools doing what's been showing to work better and I'm saying better in quotes, that's what the policy should be. Right now the F is strongly supportive of an all day thing or during class hours. So that's where I'm supporting now what the policy specifically says we could be flexible. I'd rather be a very high level thing so that the ad is what addresses it and the ad is allowed to be more flexible and change with the times. So I would prefer a policy that makes it so that the ad is what's banning. You know. Okay, I rephrase. If the policy is what's making compelling an ad to be written that if, you know, if today the best practice is to ban it during school hours, that's the ad. Right. So that's kind of where I'm at.

A: I'm wondering, you have a chance can you send us the data of. Because I haven't I haven't seen data or maybe I wasn't zeroing in on whether it's all day or whether it's not in the classroom. So I haven't seen that distinction made of like you get the, you get the big gains when it's not in passing time or at lunch versus it's not happening during the class time. It'd be great to just see that data.

confidence: 0.96
A: Yeah. Maybe refresh it because I don't recall it. I don't recall it because my, my recollection is the data I've seen has been like no cells on phones in class leads to more engaged students and increased student achievement. I haven't seen it where it's like you get the big increase when you don't allow it during passing time and lunchtime.

start time: 571:08:50.000

D: So that's what I also want to add that all day during passing time at lunchtime is also solving for other problems like for example, kids skipping out of class, going on supposedly restroom breaks or kids during lunchtime not even talking to each other. You know, the social hour. And we know socialization is a huge part of brain development and growing, you know, just growing in general. We're talking about bullying. Right. So I mean, yeah, there probably is data. It's been a while since I looked at it, but I can, I can ask for it again and have it share.

E: Yeah, I have a letter or an email from. You probably have it too, from the teacher at Ida B. Wells saying it just does not work just to say classroom. They're doing all sorts of stuff out of the classroom. She said please, please be courageous and pass something that's always all day. And the research shows, I've been reading a lot of the research that we are not taking something away from these kids. We're giving them something by letting them be away from their phones. So I really think, I think morally we need to take it away. We've got research that shows us and we're just waffling. And I don't.

F: And Patty, I'm with you as well. I feel like we do need to be courageous. Just like you don't ask a three year old what time their bedtime should be. I feel morally obligated to do something, particularly because it's our students that are the lowest performing that will see the most Gains just with that piece of information. But also I'm reading the Anxious Generation right now and the data is. It's really compelling about the benefits of just having six hours away from your phone. It's super compelling. If you have time to look at the book, I highly recommend it and I would be in favor of establishing a really strong value statement that we care about the kids that aren't performing very well and this is what we're doing about it and everyone else for that matter.

You know, some students are just kind of concerned about like the safety concerns, you know, not being able to, you know, say if they have to like call the police and safety situation. They just felt very unsafe not being able to have their phones just when they eat off campus. But I just wanted to express that.

G: Yes. Couple things. One is Director Wong speaks about data that shows improve academic for our under utilized. I mean, underrepresented kids are the ones that are at the lower end. I would love to see that data because I know for the last week been like tearing through a lot of the data that we have. I've been looking at a lot of the data nationwide and when we look at kids, that's usually on the bottom piece. I haven't seen anywhere that show the reason why or if improvement happened was because of cell phone bans. Now I know there's a lot of opinions out there. Absolutely. I know there's a lot of, you know, pockets where people have done stuff but haven't seen anything nationally that shows a correlation between increased academic rigor, I mean academic performance and the banning of cell phone usage. But I know there's a lot of opinions and I've seen a lot of opinions but haven't actually seen the actual data when you look at, at least I haven't yet when been looking at the data across the nation around academic performance of kids, especially our black and brown Native American kids. So that's one. And if you have it, I would love to see it because I'm like, if that is, if that data is correct and we have a big enough data sample to say, hey, this is one thing that is actually helping, then I will be all for having a ban on school having cell phones at all, period. The other thing is interesting because this is one thing the director of the past said, she said, well, we wouldn't let our third and fifth graders, you know, pick what they want to eat, but yet we let our students and we have enough courage in our students for them to understand our experiment or whatever we do with gender identity. And so if they have the maturity of stuff to deal with that kind of stuff, why wouldn't they have the maturity to deal with making the right decisions on cell phones as well?

E: Some of the research, Gary has shown that cell phones are actually addictive, so they don't have a lot of choice. So it's, you know, there's so much out there that's very frightening that we don't really know. And the research that I've seen hasn't said so much about test scores as much as social, emotional, well being, especially with girls, if you get rid of cell phones. And also that where it's most important not to have it is middle schools at puberty. That's when you really don't want cell phones. So that's another thing we need to look at.

G: Yeah, and I hear you, but I just don't want us to, I don't want us to be speaking on the data like a four con conclusion. Yeah, when we don't have enough samples yet and we don't have enough samples at all for pps. This is only our first semester. So I just, I Just want to make sure that we're not. We're not stating our opinion as fact when we need to make sure that as schools, districts around the country, and I've been talking to school board members around the country are starting to implement these things. I just don't want us to start saying facts that have not been proven yet.

F: I can share. What the anxious generation says is that kids, the developing brain is operating in two modes, largely, particularly like up through adolescence. And that's in discovery mode. And that's free from distractions and free from the addiction of having a phone. Just so it's either discovered discovery or. I'm forgetting the other one. It starts with the D defense mode. When kids are on their phones, it shows them in defense mode, makes it harder for them to learn and take in new information and also harder to develop the skills that they need with their peers where they're kind of growing at the same time. And the other thing about teenagers is for anybody that's raised teenagers, they have a convincing argument about why, you know, it should be okay to stay up till 3am or why, you know, they shouldn't have protein for breakfast or whatever. So I think, you know, teenagers, their job is to push back. But as adults, we have all survived this and we need to be the adults in terms of being courageous about the outcomes that we want for our kids.

But once again, I don't care if one book says it or three books says it. I need to where's the data that shows improve academic performance for our kids? Because that's what we're saying. We're saying, well, if we do this, it'll be an academic improvement for our kids. All I'm saying is where's that data at? That's all I'm saying. If that data is there, great, then let's move that way. But if his data is not there, then we really need to make sure that we are doing something that's going to benefit kids and not just saying something we hope or think will benefit kids. If we're talking about the data is there, but I haven't seen the data.

D: Director, I can share with you some that I've seen. Like, for example, in 2016, I mean, it's not just here and there, it's a whole country. The UK banned mobile devices in 2016. And then and there's a study that was released the year after that showed that there was an increase. Significant increase in student test scores and hours of exercise.

start time: 736:35:50.000
end time: 743:48:10.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Absolutely. And I've heard about that one. And the UK spends a lot more on their kids per student than we do, too. And there's a lot of other societal stuff that the UK deals with that we don't. I mean, that we deal with that they don't. So I understand. I mean, you can look at Amsterdam, you can look at other schools, district across the country. The rigor stuff are a little different than what we do here. So I'm looking for the data that's here in the United States that we're in that shows this.

A: Okay. I think I'm gonna. I'm gonna ask Andrew to go next. But since we're. Since we're not acting on it, we have some time to look some data. So maybe Eddie and staff, we can see what we can find. Since it's an active conversation all across the US I would think that if there's data, we will find it. Go ahead, Director.

F: May I add one more thing? So Steve Jobs would not allow his kids to have smartphones. And I thought that was, you know, this has been years now, but I thought that was also compelling. It's anecdotal, but that the developers of some of these technologies would not allow their children, their own children access to me says a lot.

confidence: 0.96
H: Yeah, I'll be quick. I definitely support cell phones off during class time, and I think I probably could get to cell phones off during the entire school day. And again, it's important to me that the, you know, the AD deal with the specifics. But I think as a board, that is. That is the kind of difference in policy in terms of what we're passing. But I think I could get there for, you know, for a variety of reasons, I wouldn't support it. Outside of that, I think, you know, I don't see nearly as, you know, again, it's sort of that academic focus. I don't see nearly as much of a problem with a kid, you know, checking their cell phone during football practice or during a club or something along those lines. I did want to just return, Eddie, to something you said, because I want to keep stressing, because I hear a lot, and I know you've heard even more than I have from teachers and administrators who are talking about how difficult this is to enforce, and they want us to pass something so they don't have to do that anymore. This cell phone policy won't work. If teachers don't enforce it and administrators don't enforce it, it doesn't matter what we pass. And I guess I kind of want to disabuse folks of this notion. I don't know. And I'm trying to have some conversations too with administrators to figure out why is it so hard to enforce a school policy, right? That like there are challenges, that I don't want to minimize those challenges because we're hearing from folks of saying like this is so hard to enforce and school board, you better do something. I don't think us passing a district wide policy is going to change how difficult this is to enforce on the ground. I know for a fact at least two of the high schools right now where I have some, some, some personal interaction with folks, the cell phone policies that those schools have enacted are not being enforced consistently. They're not being enforced. You know, and even at Grant, I'm hearing the anecdotal stories of the kids who are getting around what's happening there. And that's going to continue to happen. And so I guess I just, I don't want to give anyone a false notion that we're going to pass something that's going to get easier for teachers. It's not, it's going to get harder. Particularly if we say no cell phones at all during the school day. I guess guarantee whether we put them in pouches or, you know, boxes or whatever, kids have burner phones. Kids will say, I don't have my phone, I didn't bring it today, and they're still going to have it in a backpack. So. So that enforcement is going to be key as we go through this.

A: So I'm just going to close out this section because I want to move some other sections. So I will say that I could maybe get there for all day for middle school. I think as long as we have open campuses, I just think, I think it's unrealistic and I'm just gonna reinforce what JJ said. So, you know, I'm a parent of a student who was off somewhere on Powell Boulevard having lunch when there was an active shooter situation. And the lockdown locked students out. And you know, fortunately, students who were locked out and didn't know what to do had access to their phones. You know, I just think as long as we have open campuses, it's awfully hard not to have high school students have their phones or have access to the phones or have, and actually have needs for the phones. So that was, I think, a good discussion.

G: So. And I'm okay whichever way we go, as far as whether it's just in school classes or if it's all day, I can get to either way. But the thing is, when we make this policy, what support are we going to give these schools? Because like, like Director Scott said, the teacher's still going to have to enforce this stuff. But there could be ways that we help mediate that, as well. As a board, I'm talking about dollars. Right. Whether it's John Powder or whatever. So whatever policy we're making, we have to make sure that we are going to follow that up with support, which might mean it might need financial support. Because what we don't want to do is we don't want to pass a policy that's not enforceable because certain. Certain schools don't have resources to do what they feel like they need to do to comply with the policy.

C: Back to, like, the other topic, kind of just adding on to what Director Scott was saying. You know, I know we spoke about the phone policy with the district student council, and they also expressed how even though their schools have, you know, their own policies, it stopped being consistently enforced in their schools. You know, some teachers are more stricter, some teachers are more lenient. You know, our students are just seeing this directly happening at, you know, almost, I believe, from. We have representation for almost all of our high schools. And so basically, all of our representatives from the high schools are saying they see this issue happening.

start time: 847:00:10.000
end time: 876:20:58.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Great, thank you. I was going to go next to the nature of exceptions. And we've had some discussion in committee about the nature of exceptions. And you'll see listed here, I think three of the four exceptions are ones in which we've had, I think, like, just general agreement that. Which shows the IEPs, the 504s, academic activities, and then, I'm sorry, individual students need ELL assistance, like using a translator function on their phone, and then alternative programs where you might have teen parents or, you know, frankly, students who are 19 or 20. The one place we haven't necessarily had a discussion about academic activities, like, say you had a yearbook class and you want to have a. Like take pictures or video and how you would utilize that. But what I'd like to suggest is that instead of putting them in policy, what we would put in policy is that there will be some exceptions in these four broad categories and then the administrative directive would have the ability to flesh them out with all the details and also could be flexible enough that they could be changed as we learned from that.

start time: 876:23:14.000
end time: 882:15:20.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think it's fine to list the categories we know about. I would also include language that says there may be other exceptions as determined by the superintendent. Just again the things that may not catch all category. But. But otherwise. Yeah, I think it makes sense to have the details in the ad. I mean I'll just give an example. My daughter took a cell phone photography class. I, she loved it. I hope that class doesn't go away.

A: It would just. It would say there will be some exceptions in these categories along with the catch all category and then the ad would spell out what, what those are. Any issue with that? Again, this would probably be two sentences. I don't imagine. Well, plus the.

start time: 889:05:18.000
end time: 890:43:18.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Yeah, I mean for me it's just separating policy from ad and how that should be. Right.

start time: 890:44:14.000
end time: 910:01:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I mean I'll just say the IEP504. I don't think you want the, the board should not be writing that. And I say we're going to learn some things that we just in terms of the implementation that we want to be flexible and not have to keep coming back. Okay. The next category is consequences for student misuse. And we didn't have a lot of board feedback on this. I will say I think what we consistently heard or I heard anyway in the committee was you know, continuing to use the students rights of responsibility versus like setting up some other structure for cell phone. It should be treated just like anything else and not. Not have a separate set of consequences that are set in the policy that are different from the students rights and handbook.

start time: 910:53:30.000
end time: 940:16:40.000
confidence: 0.94
D: Yeah, I just had a quick comment. If we do do something about this in the policy, I would like it to focus or to, to be focused on that consequences should be non punitive because you know one of the things about the issues with cell phones is the, you know, the apps and stuff like that they use a lot of addiction science. Right. There's an addictive nature to it. So like. And we know that the best way towards treating that kind of behavior is through treatment, not through punishment. And if there are, you know, like if there are schools that for example maybe their schools are not as up to the latest in terms of, you know. Right. So I like that reference to the Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook. Because I feel like Student's Rights and Responsibilities Handbook does have specific language about proper consequences. But, you know, like, if it does become a problem where the type of discipline used in different schools is differing and maybe not following best practices, then that's something that should be addressed. So again, I still fear that that should be something addressed in the ad, but also hoping that if there's some problems that do occur down the line, that the policy, you know, I would be in favor of a policy stating that if there are problems down the line, this needs to be looked at. Nothing specific, but just, you know.

A: Yeah, well, the value of serving on the board for four years, if there's problems down the line, you can correct it. For me, again, this would be another case of I think very short, you know, two section, maybe two sentences that. Just indicating that we don't have a special set of discipline for like violating the cell phone policy, but that we utilize the Student's Rights and Responsibility Handbook. And you know, that you could have, you could have another value judgment or statement of, you know, reduce or minimize loss of instructional time and maybe to be non punitive, but again, not to create something new in policy. And the Students Rights and Responsibility Handbook is periodically updated. So those are opportunities. And also it has escalating. I mean, it already takes into it into account all the different things that students do that may require there to be some rights and responsibilities exercised. So it seems like it's already, the structure is already there. Michelle or Gary or Andrew.

confidence: 0.96
F: I think one thing that I'm concerned about as I was reading through the policies is that it seems like there is a stepped, sort of a tiered or progressive discipline. I would just want us to track how that discipline is being meted out. It would be really interesting to me to track if it's definitely our lowest performing students and they're losing. Well, I don't think any of the punishment. They're losing instructional time. It's more like they're putting their phone, their phone has to be confiscated until maybe a parent picks it up. But I'd still like to track the disciplinary data because I'm interested in who's being disciplined and who's not. Who's not.

start time: 973:45:54.000
end time: 976:59:54.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So Michelle, this, this would not consistently. This would not have a. Here's what happens to your phone if you violate the policy. That would, I mean, having your parent.

confidence: 0.97
A: That would not that kind of specific. Like here's. Here's a new form of discipline. That's what's suggested here, unless everybody has a different point of view, is that that is going to rest with the school about what the consequences are. And I will say students rights and responsibilities. We already collect data on student discipline and it's actually posted every year. So.

start time: 987:48:00.000
end time: 990:07:40.000
confidence: 0.93
I: Also we also track contraband in searches. And so if cell phones are being confiscated, that's also tracked.

end time: 994:07:40.000
confidence: 0.96
F: Okay, great. I mean, I think it was where there was discipline that was progressive. The policies did spell out whether it was a tier two out of three offense or tier one, and I thought that was helpful.

confidence: 0.97
H: Yeah, I like just referring to the student handbook. And the other thing I guess I'll say is kind of similar to my comment about the teachers having to enforce it. I don't want to see loss of instructional time, but there are going to be instances where students need a strong level of discipline to make this effective. So I just think we need to be realistic. If schools are, through the ad or through practice, just choose not to put, you know, consequences on this, then the policy will be violated. So I think we need to be realistic about the fact if we're going to ban cell phones, there are going to be kids eventually who are suspended as a result of that. It won't be first, you know, or whatever. It'll go through the normal process. But eventually that's going to happen and we need to be ready for that. Right.

start time: 1006:57:50.000
end time: 1008:18:50.000

H: There's also different degrees because the fifth time they violated it without paying attention or without, you know, like, like, you know, just, you know, flag. Literally doing it. Right. So that's just a reality.

A: Time you remind it referenced the Student Rights and Responsibility Handbook, which has a very, like, detailed set of consequences for a whole host of different things.

start time: 1016:02:10.000
end time: 1021:56:58.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Yeah. And to add to your point, I mean, it will get really complicated. Like, for example, a student having confiscation because they're using their cell phone to bully. It's a completely different instance than like checking your text messages. Right. So I think that that's a level of complication that a policy should.

start time: 1021:57:54.000

start time: 1025:47:00.000
end time: 1033:09:20.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Yeah, I think something the district council raised. I think when we were looking at the policies from like individual schools, I think something we noticed was in like the first schools who have yonder pouches, we just saw some inequities because like if, you know, you break a yonder pouch, you don't have to pay. But for some schools it's like 60 or like 75. So districts and council is just kind of concerned for like students who aren't able to afford to kind of pay those fees if they break a yonder pouch.

start time: 1033:48:20.000
end time: 1041:27:30.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Okay. Yeah, that was interesting, jj, because when I was looking through all the just high school, individual high school policies, the ones that had some sort of mechanism that for enforcement, most of the policy was about the thing versus about what the actual policy was. Like, you know, what counts as a scratch or, you know, an inoperable amount. That's a great point. Thank you for raising that.

start time: 1042:44:30.000
end time: 1052:17:10.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Oh, yeah, I'm agreeing with the Student Rights and Responsibility handbook, I hope. And I'm with. And concurrent with what Director Scott was saying, you know, there is, there's going to need to make sure that we have consequences that make sure that the actions are not repeated, you know, and so I think we need to just be prepared for whatever those are. But. And I encourage our staff and teachers and administration to make sure that those consequences are enough to where we don't get disregard of the policies.

start time: 1053:02:10.000
end time: 1111:07:12.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Okay. So I think we're at a natural stopping point because also we're going to just as a reminder, the next meeting we'll have student data and the district supports. As you can see, most of the items are fall into other categories, whether it be budget or, you know, how, how we resource things. So it's almost a whole different topic. So I think I'm, I'm going to stop here. I appreciate everybody's feedback. I think we have some consensus in most areas, which will be great. And we can maybe come back with some draft language around the places where we think there's consensus to and the places where we think there might be a lack of not yet consensus. So move on to the next agenda item. And just briefly, we have two policies that have been referred to the board for first reading the high school credit earned prior to ninth grade and diploma requirements policies. Roseanne, did we have any public comment on either one of those? I want to note for everybody that in the high school credit earned prior to ninth grade, there was a new staff report that came through that's in the packet that has staff Feedback on or an additional set a section with additional information that was based on some public comment that was brought up. And it's basically staff's response to the public comment. It's not a suggestion for changing the policy at all, but it was responding to somebody who asked a question about why is something missing and staff is responding to that. So I just call everybody's attention to that doesn't necessitate a, any sort of modification of the policy. And thanks staff for providing that. And then I'm just going to note on the diploma requirements policy. I talked to Director Hollins who had raised a separate issue at the last board meeting. That's a pretty major topic, which was whether we should have some sort of proficiency standard in our, in our diploma policy. And ask Director Hollins if he has a proposal to bring it forward that we would look at separately as just as a general matter of policy. We, the changes that are currently under contemplation are just required by law. So we're going to go ahead and move, keep moving those forward. But Director Hollins, if you want to bring a proposal forward, we'll put it on the agenda and start a discussion. Like I say, I think it's a very large topic, not that we can't tackle it because I know it's something that came up in Director Wong's committee earlier. So moving along, number five, may I.

A: Great, we'll incorporate that in. So the next agenda item and I'm just gonna take a few minutes. As I noted on the agenda, just a preview for a future discussion. A student raised the topic and they brought it up during public comment and then subsequently have asked for consideration in this committee. And I don't know that it's a policy discussion, but I just want to Flag this issue of access for freshmen to have access to ap. A lot of. Well, some of our main materials on the website are very explicit that it's open to ninth graders. When students have tried to register for classes, they've been told that they can't register as a freshman. And that just because it's on the website doesn't mean it's a. It's a policy or that the district has to follow it. So I would like to have a discussion about it at a future meeting and could be just understanding whether this is actually, I know we. We have policies relating to student access to classes and equitable access access. And so it may not be a change in the policy, but just understanding whether we actually are following our policies.

start time: 1158:58:58.000
end time: 1160:14:10.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Well, we do have staff here today who can speak to this today if you'd like.

start time: 1160:16:10.000
end time: 1171:44:06.000
confidence: 0.97
A: I don't. I don't want to get into. I want to. Because we have another big topic that I want to get to, but I just want to flag what that topic is that's been raised. And I think we should, you know, out of respect for students who raised the issue. And it does say on our website there's a slide deck and, you know, who can take AP classes at pps. And the very first sentence says, you know, all students grades 9 to 12. And yet students are not being allowed to take those classes. So we can make time the next meeting or. Or we can get a staff memo on how it complies with our policies.

start time: 1171:45:58.000
end time: 1184:11:34.000
confidence: 0.97
H: Can I just add my voice to that request? I. I would love to understand more. And there may be very good reasons for it and very good academic reasons for the reason why freshmen can. And I didn't know we had that policy. I will tell you, just from personal experience, it was surprising to learn that when my kids went to high school that they were not allowed to take AP courses. I will also say my niece specifically transferred out of PPS to Lake Oswego because she was not allowed to take AP courses her freshman year. So, again, not quite. I mean, there may be very good reasons, but I think it would be great for the board to hear what those reasons are, whether they're still relevant, whether that's still a good. A good policy. And then to your point, if it is, then we should change what we have on the website. You know, so I'm just adding my voice. I think it'd be a great board conversation.

start time: 1184:13:42.000
end time: 1189:24:38.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Okay, so just to preview. And I say this is brought up by a student who. There was room in the classroom and the class. And there were no required prerequisites, so, you know, met the requirements that he could have taken it and was just denied access to it.

start time: 1189:25:34.000
end time: 1190:20:20.000
confidence: 0.96

start time: 1190:23:10.000
end time: 1196:46:20.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Well, I'm just saying on our website, the. Basically the AP website, it says I can send the link around. There's a slideshow that basically says everybody can take it. AP classes are for students in grades 9 to 10. They are not only for students with the best grades. Anyone who is confident, motivated and ready to enroll in AP classes.

start time: 1197:26:24.000
end time: 1221:25:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So we can talk about maybe what might be useful, like just to tee up that conversation. Okay. With that, I want to turn the meeting over to Director Scott. Yeah. The next agenda item is the policy 1.2 0.10. This deals with all the board of education, but also includes how board members are elected. And I had just raised at the last board meeting as the city has gone to district voting. We had looked at this previously and just interested in the topic again and getting data. Director Scott led a task force and he also made a very presentation at the National School Boards association. The. Along with the district staff who worked on this policy. And so I asked Director Scott to like tee things up. You have. Everybody has in there in the. Well, it's been posted the census redistricting study, which really was the impetus for the task force work that Director Scott led that was, you know, how do we rebalance after this census? And then the second question we had was, do we want to change how we're voting?

start time: 1222:21:30.000

confidence: 0.95
H: Great. Happy to do it. Yeah. It's about a 45 minute presentation. So settle in. I'm just. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna shorten it to about five, I hope. And Roseanne, hopefully if we can bring up the. The presentation that Kate Wilkerson and I did both for National School Board Association Conference. And also we did an osba. Although, you know, it's funny, nsba, we had a full room of people and osba, we had three. So I don't know what that says, but. And Roseanne, actually, if you can, I'm going to skip through. So you have this presentation. Kate's section was really the first sort of 18 or 19 slides where she went through a lot of legal background and different case law. I'm not going to even try and do that. So Roseanne, if you wouldn't mind going to slide 20.

confidence: 0.97
H: We. I don't. I can't Say definitively, but what we have heard is that. That they. Nobody knows of a district that does zones when we sort of ask them. There may be, but it's all kind of consistent. So. So I'll go really quickly. And actually, that's 19. I think we go to the next slide. Actually, the next one after that, we don't use our pictures. So what we really. So this was really about sort of what we did in that task force. And what was really interesting for me, and I think the board had a similar experience was, you know, when I got elected, you know, we. We have this system where you have to live in your zone and you get elected, you know, district wide, which seemed odd to me. And I also knew a little bit just from history that, you know, I know that. That similar systems are actually unconstitutional, and they have been ruled unconstitutional in some southern states. And so, you know, when I got on the board and we finally had a chance to turn to this, we sort of started looking at this.

start time: 1254:32:06.000

end time: 1363:14:48.000

H: And the reality is that, you know, these. The system that we have here, they. They have a very racist history, right? So they started after. In Reconstruction, after slavery, and it was really a way to keep black people from getting elected to office. So, you know, that the idea was that if you had smaller zones or districts that were predominantly people of color, you would have them elect people of color. And white majorities in a lot of the southern states did not want to see that. So we should just say right up front, this system has a very racist past in a racist history. And what was interesting for me as we went into. I kind of thought, well, we should change that, right? There's a. There's a. You know, there's a bad history here. It's much harder to run district wide, and so we should change that. And the 2020 Census and redistricting was a good opportunity, you know, to do that. I will say one of the bullets on here that I talk about is we really thought the community board would rally behind this effort to change the historically racist system. But. But in reality, it was a little more complicated. So, next slide. And Roseanne, are you able to click on that hot link in the. Oh, yeah, you can go to the next. Next slide on gentrification in Portland. Are you able to click on that? And is it still live? I think it is. So, you know, again, you can. You can click on that in the. In the version you got. If you could scroll down just a little bit. What. What this. And it's been a long time since I did this, what this, this graph that the Oregonian actually published a while back shows is just gentrification in Portland. And what it shows is going from over time what's happened to communities of color. And what it shows, and again, I won't spend a lot of time is that what used to be predominantly sort of in North Northeast, these really robust, vibrant neighborhoods have been, have been pushed into outer and outer East Portland, some other areas, but actually outside of, in some ways outside of PPS boundaries altogether. And we used to be a very diverse district and we are less so as a result. And that's shown on the next slide. If you go back to the PowerPoint, I'm so surprised the technology still works. It's just totally terrified me when I was giving the presentation, like, would the hotlink work? What this graph shows is going all the way back to 1972 Black student enrollment in north and Northeast schools. And then with a district total line running in there. And so you can see the blue line is black students in north and Northeast schools. The red bar graph is all black students and then the district total. And you know, I was surprised to learn just the, you know, you had a little fluctuation back in the 70s and then this sort of peak in the early 90s and then this, this really dramatic decline. Right. And again, which is just reflective of gentrification, you know, in the city. And so sort of the next slide there was in, you know what, after going through this process and having this task force meet, looking at some of the data, what we really determined was the, the latest research is pretty unclear on the impact of, of at large elections and what, what, what, you know, and again, I don't want to, I don't want to overstate the data because the, the studies out there are pretty small. But what they're beginning to show is that what used to be a system that absolutely kept people of color from getting elected, that that happened in areas in, in cities or districts where you had very concentrated groups of minority voters now that you have more dispersed groups of minority voters. These same at large systems with this racist past actually may be resulting in more diverse people getting elected. And anecdotally, I don't want to say that's necessarily what's happened here in pbs, but anecdotally when I started talking to some of our newly elected members, because again, you know, when we started looking at this, we, we had a very diverse board which has gotten even more diverse. You know, in the meantime, I, you know, I hope Herman doesn't mind me speaking for him, but, you know, when I sort of said. I said, hey, look, we should overturn the system. And he said, what are you talking about? He said, as I ran for reelection or not reelection for. Ran for election, he said, I had black people all over the district saying, I am so glad that I get a vote for you. And so, you know, in a conversation with Herman, he was pretty clear. He's like, don't. Don't touch a system that seems to be working. And so we really came out of it. I. I was surprised, right? I, you know, sort of changed my mind, you know, going into it thinking we're going to get rid of it, to thinking actually what we want to do is, is. Is accidentally harm our ability to have a really diverse board. And I think that's the conversation we had at the time and, you know, was. Was really about, you know, definitely not rushing in any changes. We ended up not making changes to the way we get elected. We did redraw a couple of the boundaries, which we had to do, you know, as a result. And so, you know, the takeaways we gave at the conference, which are the next slide. Roseanne. Sorry, I had some very rudimentary graphics in this was just, you know, I know, Cass. I know. Very complicated stuff. You know, was just noting that, you know, you're. We hope that. That the community's goal and value is to have a board that reflects the diversity of the community. Every single community is going to have very different demographics and voting trends. And that, you know, at large voting may be different, disenfranchising minority voters, which I think it did for. For. For decades, for maybe 100 years. But it is also possible, it could be empowering, a collection of really diverse voices that have been scattered throughout development patterns and urban gentrification. And so our recommendation, our takeaway was to have a conversation with your community about the right path forward. So that was the presentation. And I think that, again, from my perspective, it was sort of this thought of, let's make sure that whatever changes we make don't have unintended consequences. Because I think everyone on this board, you know, has that same value of wanting a diverse board. And some of the other problems that we noted at the time were that, you know, it is hard to get elected district wide. It does. It does cost more money. But taking care of that problem, we didn't want to accidentally end up, you know, with. With. With. With, again, a less diverse board in the meantime. Two of the things I'll note That we're not in the policy. We did talk to Malone county elections at the time and if, if I'm recalling and Liz, I can't remember if you did some of that outreach or someone else did, but my recollection at the time was they asked for at least a year minimum Runway. If we are going to make this kind of change, it's really extensive on their side to actually, you know, we don't have any zoned school district, zoned elections right now. You have to live within the zone. But we don't actually send out ballots. We within the zone. And so.

B: So at the. Yeah, and at the time they were staring down the changes to the citywide election and they were putting in a new platform. So I think in opposite order, the platform first and then these changes that were coming. We have since talked with them and the latest word we have is mid to late November of this year would be the time they would have to know if we were going to make that change in order to have ballots for May.

H: For May. Okay. That's good updated information with the new system. So that was one consideration is just the timing to make sure that, you know, we don't make a last minute change that messes things up. And then the other thing I will say this is just a personal view. I think we need to be really thoughtful about when we change our elections. And I'm more putting this now in a national context that, you know, we are seeing throughout the nation changes to election rules and laws that are being put in place to, to. To affect the outcome. And I think the people doing it are kind of being pretty open and blunt about the fact that they are trying to affect the outcome. Whether it's whether when you can vote or absentee ballots or redrawing districts or gerrymandering, all those other things. And so that's the other thing I would say is to the extent we make changes to the way we do elections, I would want to be really thoughtful. I would want to have a lot of community input around that and I would want to make sure that we're giving a lot of lead time so that it's not a last minute change that people have. People sort of understand what that means and the impact it might have. And it was longer than five minutes. I'm sorry, but less than 45.

A: That's great guidance and just sharing out. I would think one of the. We'll give people an opportunity to ask you questions. But one of the things that I'd like to do is Just get more data. I think it's interesting. So I feel like I've seen some of the ebbs and flows at PPS since 2000. I served on a diverse board in 2001, and then when I got on the board Again in 2017, you had one person of color on it. So much less diverse. And then obviously a change over time. I look at the data, I. I do see some of our communities of color who are actually a pretty large percentage of the relatively large percentage of the district who haven't had representation historically. Never more than one Latino at a time. I think only two in total. So one of the things I was thinking is like going back and talking to previous board members who had served and, you know, the challenges and advantages, just to get a broader timeline, but also to look through the data and then also look through the data around when we have contested, contested races, what sort of outcomes you see when they're contested races, you know, how much money gets raised. I mean, certainly one of the things with the city moving to zoned races, they also move to small donor elections, which sort of also takes care of like another big hurdle. So I'm not at all suggesting that PPs start that, nor do I think there would be a lot of support for spending public dollars in the campaigns. But that those are two ways that, you know, the Portland City of Portland charter movement tried to make the offices more accessible is that first you'd have a district versus running citywide. And then the. The challenges of raising money to be competitive, they brought that forward. So I thought it just might be interesting to pull some just historic data from PPS races for people to look at.

F: I want to say we have a really challenging state history in terms of land use and specifically that, you know, this was a state that was founded as a white utopia and discouraged black people from being here, whether they were enslaved or not. And so we still have some of those legacy pieces of like, practice in place. We, I think right now have the most diverse board the school district has ever had, which I think is a win and I think reflects our community's values. We started talking about equity not that long ago. We didn't talk about it in 2000. We were talking about racial equity. It's now a bigger part of the broader conversation. And so I do feel like our board currently reflects the community's values. Now do we have a one to one relationship with, you know, how many Native Americans and how many African Americans? I don't think that's the case, but the Bottom line is the board is more diverse overall. I think there's also key differences and Director Scott, you brought this up between Portland and Pearland or the case study that you used. The southern states have a completely different relationship with race and land use than we do here. And we're still thinking about it. In fact, the amount of displacement that has happened in inner city Portland, specifically, specifically in Jewish and Italian neighborhoods downtown, south of downtown and the interstate corner urban renewal area that's lost, that resulted in a gross loss of population, black population near where I live would really, it would dilute if this was a zoned race, it would probably dilute the diversity in the outcome of who the community, you know, the values of our community to have diversity on our board and our board reflects that value. So I think the historical context is important maybe for having a couple data points. But really looking to the future and the future projection about where racial residential land use lands in Portland because of housing costs, I think would be really important to look at too more of a projection in the future than a look back into an older time, a time when we weren't talking about diversity. So that's my two cents.

G: I'm going to add a couple more cents onto, onto Director DePass. Comments. You know, when we were talking about this back, you know, when I think it was a couple years back, no, we looked at it and you know, I think, you know, when we, and I've been talking to some of the elders that's, that's here in Portland and I think zoning would have been a great idea 20 years ago, right? It would have been a great idea. But the powers that be didn't want that because of the racist pieces that they did not want black in leadership, they did not want blacks on boards. And so because of that, you know, we, the push for zonings before never happened. And so now that we are looking at that and with the gentrification that's happened and Director Green was absolutely right. You know, there were people all over the city that was able to vote for me, they were able to help support me, put line signs out all over the city versus just in my zone to help us get elected. And if, if we look at the outcome of our board today, right. If we are the one of the most divorced boards today, we have to ask ourselves why is that what happened?

G: What happened to the reason why we're like that versus, you know, when you're talking about 2000 and the 60s and all that stuff when it was not that. Right. And So I think when we're looking at voter suppressions throughout the country right now where the. They're trying to do different things, we don't want to inadvertently do that here, especially when we're just now getting to a time where equity is the forefront and diversity is a forefront, especially in a state like Oregon and specifically Portland, we're seeing a lot of the diversity and equity inclusion things go wayside. They're disappearing from everywhere. Government disappearing from corporate.

G: They're disappearing from that. And organism in Portland specifically is in this, in this zone or a bubble right now where we still value that. Right. And we still value pieces. We devalue diversity, we devalue equity, we devalue, you know, looking at things through different lenses. Right. We value other people experiences. And I think if we're moving to a zone piece, were actually inadvertently going back to that time where blacks, Latinos, Asians was left out of things because of where we are today. And so that's just kind of my thought on that. When we're talking about, you know, raising funds for money, that's going to be the same for at least a minority as it is, whether we're doing citywide or this, we might not have to spend much, but, you know, we have very limited African American population here in north Northeast Portland. And I don't know what the Asian and the Latino population is, but it's low. So even if the issue of raising money is going to always be a challenge for us, it's going to always be a challenge that we have to get every night because we don't have that disposable income, we don't have that generational wealth that others have to do that. So that's going to always be an issue no matter what. And so I just, I just close and say, you know, I think where we at the values of our city right now, I think that the values our cities are reflecting in who's on the board. And we can see that when we look at each other at the diocese, you know, in and out, each and every week. Thank you.

E: Yeah, I like the at large idea mainly because then everybody knows you're representing the whole, all the schools in the whole district. And there was a quote in here on your presentation that I thought was interesting, says at large districts lead to overrepresentation of minority voters where racial minority groups are a small part of the population or where Democratic voters make up a larger proportion of the population. And that's what we are. So. And it looks like that's what happened? So it's interesting.

A: I guess I want to just note one thing. I think everybody would be good to look at the packet because actually we have a fairly large Latino population across the district. Relatively speaking, it's the largest community of color. Nsa. I think the two Latinos who have been on the district board, one was Martin Gonzalez who was appointed and then I believe he won a race and then he was defeated by Steve Buell with a decided money differential. And then the second was Julia Sparza Brown. So just noting that. And the second largest group is two or more races. So just.

F: And Hispanics are growing, you know, nationally as well. It's just a fast growing, you know, voting population. They tend to be younger and yeah, we definitely want to pay attention to that and maybe we make the job easier for people who want to be interested in serving rather than drawing redrawing lines. Because also that population is spread throughout the city. I don't know specifically if there are pockets. I mean, there are pockets in Kali, but that's a population that's spread throughout the city, much like other populations are so dispersed now. We're not. We don't have our little ethnic enclaves like in the good old days.

D: The last word. It'll be words. Last words. I want to kind of continue with Director Hollins. Would you kind of started going into. Because I think it's important to kind of try to simplify this problem and what kind of problems we're trying to solve. Right. So the way I see it, there's two problems. Right. That we're trying to talk about. One problem is diversity of the board. And like I said before, we don't know what the consequences of our going to zoning. Like we could unintentionally create a, you know, it wasn't intentionally gerrymandered, but gerrymandered system. Right. Because it is now a separate zoning. And we don't know. I guess the point is, you know, from Director Scott.

start time: 1592:53:58.000

confidence: 0.94
D: Right. The record just What I'm just trying to say is that if we're trying to solve for diversity board, we don't know what the outcome is. And it's a big question mark, what Director Scott says. Like, it seems like it is favoring for a more diverse board. So that's one problem we're solving. Trying to solve for, you know, diversity board. Is it going to work or not? We don't know. Probably not. The other problem that we're trying to solve for is diversity in socioeconomic status. Right. Like, we have a problem in most boards across unpaid board positions in that it's very difficult to get representation from people who can't normally afford to run for board. Would this solve for that? Well, well, I guess my concern is that it may make campaigning cheaper, but it doesn't make being on the board cheaper. Right. So people may, you may, maybe you might initially get some people who are thinking about it, but then when they realize they have to go for four years in an unpaid position, that may already be the limiting factor that's bigger than the campaign. So again, you know, I'm open to the idea, but the problem is, you know, until we can solve that problem, you know, there's the reasons, the compelling reasons are is still too many question marks, I guess, is what I'm trying to say. So I mean, like, yeah, that's the last word.
