So, Board Policy 1.2 0.010 P provides that the board shall elect one of its members as board chair and one of its members as board vice chair at the first regular meetings in January and July. As it is our process for board members to be considered for a leadership position, board members and members elect must notify the current board manager chair in writing by June 1st if they'd like to declare their intent to run for a board leadership position. In July, Vice Chair Hollins declared his interest in the position of board chair. Thank you. And both Directors Green and Wong declared their interest in serving as board vice chair at this point. Director Wong, I see your hand is up. And I will turn the floor over to you.

B: Hey. Yeah, thanks for dealing with the issues there. I really apologize. It kind of bums me out. I have to do my first meeting virtually all the way from Denver. Hi. Yeah. I just want to say that I want to withdraw my candidacy. I originally put in my name back a while ago, before I think I heard that Director Green was put in his name as well. And since I heard Director Green had put in his name, I fully support him as vice chair. I think he'd be doing a great job. Doesn't mean I don't want to eventually someday be run for vice chair. I do. But I don't have to do it now. I feel like I have a lot of things, actually, I prefer not to do it now. Rather kind of learn the ropes first and then. But I think I originally put my name in because I was worried there might not, you know, in case someone. In case we had no one else. But, yeah, I would like to withdraw. And I put my support fully behind Director Green. Thank you.

H: Thank you. My name is Elizabeth Nelson. Nelson, I'm here today to talk about Portland Virtual Scholars. This is a program that's run through PPS in all the high schools in the district to help students with credit recovery. It has allowed hundreds of students to graduate on time with their class. Over the seven years of its existence, both the superintendent as well as multiple board members have come to the annual student panel and heard the importance of this program to the district. Unfortunately, the district does not treat the employees of Virtual Scholars with the same respect. The reason I say this is because currently the starting salary for a Virtual Scholars mentor, which is the backbone of the program, is $19 an hour. @ this Rate A mentor has to run a high school classroom with 25 students for three periods every day of the school year on their own. These are mentors alone and in charge of all classroom management and other classroom related issues that come up during the period and the rest of the school day. Because of this low pay and workload over the last two years, Virtual Scholars has lost half of its mentor staff every year. As one of the mentors said last year when quitting their job, despite calling it the best job they have ever had in their entire life, that if I stay here, I will end up sleeping in a cardboard box by the end of the school year. Despite my 10 years of service with the district, I have finally had enough as well. Because on top of the pay, I am at the top of the pay. Was at the top of the pay scale making $22 an hour. And at the same time, this job I just started yesterday, I will be making $22 an hour for the state and I'm at the bottom of the pay scale. I think the final straw for me was during contract negotiations with pfsp, the PPS negotiator said we don't want to pay our employees poverty wa not follow up with any real or substantial changes like offering a fair living wage. In fact, they offered the opposite and offered only a 2% raise for employees. You are losing some of your best, brightest and most dedicated workers simply because they cannot take the low wages that you keep giving us. Every year during classified connections, we hear how important we are for the success of students. And yet every year you stop only at words and do not show us because we still have poverty wages, poor working conditions and unsafe working environments. If you really want to have the best outcome for students, you need to invest in the people who work directly with them. The best symbol of this is this. This is what you give for employees who have worked 10 years. A lanyard that falls apart after a month of use instead of the pins you used to give us and celebrate us. But you don't seem to care because all we hear is words. Thank you.

G: Malik. Ilkare M a l a k e l k H E R I started working with the district a month ago and they sent me to Jackson Middle School and I start having sexual harassment. Sexual harassment. Okay. And the person who did this to me, I asked my supervisor to talk to him and he didn't do anything. I emailed the HR and they didn't do anything. So I called Adam and Adam Sent Anthony to me. And Anthony, the first thing he did to me, he looked me from head to toes multiple times. And he told me if he told me, like, what to do in this situation. And I told him, this guy, he kept asking me to go out with him, and they said no. He's a pushy guy. He kept asking me to go out with him, and they said no. And he kept asking me, so what should they do now? He's like, no. You keep saying no. But this guy Anthony, he's teaching me what to say. I told him. I said, no, no. He told me, you gotta say no. And I told him that. I said no. So Anthony, he didn't really do. He's not gonna help me. I told him, can you please move me to a different school, because I think you're not gonna help me here. So he said, I'm not gonna send you to a different school because you didn't do anything wrong. He said, give me some time and I'll talk to you soon. And the next day, I talked to Roshani from hr. I'm having anxiety and I can't talk anymore. And today I came here to quit. Here is my card, my keys. And they sent me to a different school, and I'm having problem in another school, and they didn't do anything. HR not helping. Supervisor not helping. Manager is not helping. I'm here just to help, to work, to make money. I'm not here to do anything else. I'm here to make money. And they're making that so fucking hard for me. I'm shaking right now. Thank you so much. Thank you for this experience.

I: Before you move on, with your permission, I just. I don't want to be silent on that last comment. It is challenging to hear. I just want to make sure I'm absolutely clear. And I know that you would agree with me that we're vehemently opposed to sexual harassment in our workplace and in our schools. We absolutely don't tolerate retaliation for making a complaint of sexual harassment either. We have board policy on workplace harassment, an administrative directive to our supervisors and our administrators. We keep records of every Title IX sexual harassment complaint, and we take immediate steps to support any individual who makes a complaint. Complaint. If any of our employees have concerns about sexual harassment, and this is for our audience or anybody listening, I want to make sure they understand that there's multiple paths to reporting and Escalating these concerns at pps. These include their supervisor. Their supervisor, supervisor, union representatives, Title IX office and human resources. We have a long standing working relationship with SEIU on sexual harassment complaints made by and made against their members. And we will continue to engage with them on the issues that are raised tonight. Thank you.

And although we may have policies in place, she hasn't been here long enough to understand those policies or to know who she could talk to. She did what she thought that she could do. And for whatever the reason that is, again, unbeknownst to me at this point, she still has an experience as to where the woman just quit at the dais. And to me, to me, I don't see why we still here talking. Somebody should be out there talking with this young lady because we just lost the person of color. I don't.

E: You've all heard me talk before. I'm a PPS parent and I'm also the lunch lady at Creative Science of Bridger. I recently met with one of our members, a custodian who shared with me her recent interactions with PPS HR regarding sexual harassment she's experienced at work. She's given me permission to share this information tonight. I will not be using her real name though, and I will refer to her as Jane. And by the way, all of this is documented in emails too. On April 3rd of this year, the principal at the school Jane worked out reached out via email to HR and shared a written statement from Jane. In the written statement, Jane disclosed that the other custodian at her school was taking pictures of her without her knowledge or consent. The Sun School manager and assistant manager saw him and told her, sorry, okay. Jane said that this custodian tells her about his personal, private and intimate details of his relationship with his wife. He tells her what women he finds hot. That's quotes there. And what he would like to do with them. When women come through the school for various after school activities, he will tell Jane about which body parts he likes on these women. If this isn't alarming enough, he has stated in front of Jane and others other custodians that when he works at high schools, there are some girls that he almost can't resist and it's hard to control himself around these girls. When I say girls, I'm referring to our students. Students. Jane has done everything she is supposed to, including telling this custodian that she does not like when he says inappropriate things to her or around her. She reached out to her principal, her supervisor, HR and hr and her supervisor did conduct an investigation. During this time, the custodian in question reached out to Jane over various social networking platforms. Jane took screen screenshots, sent them the communications to HR as she was instructed to do so. On April 17, Jane reached out to HR to see if there was an update on the investigation. April 18, HR replied and said the invasion investigation was not complete and they would reach out to her as soon as it was completed. On May 10, Jane emailed HR to let them know that the custodian was reaching out to her again via social media. HR said he would not be doing that, that he should not be doing that, and they would talk to him. They also stated that their investigation would be wrapped up by the end of the week and they would verify this with Jane. On May 17, Jane reached out again without receiving a response. On May 25, Jane reached out to HR once again for the status of the investigation investigation. HR replied that they completed their investigation and that the custodians unprofessional conduct and workplace harassments were founded. They stated that they could not tell her what action was taken but that her complaints were addressed and they would be sending her a formal response. She's never received the formal response. I understand that we're not able to be informed of the actions that were taken. What we do know is that the custodian was not fired but moved to a different building, which is pretty much happens all the time. Anytime anything happens, someone's moved this anyway. Let me get back on track. All the while he was telling everyone he got promoted. My union and I believe in progressive discipline. But I understand from what I heard from management and HR say in our last bargaining session last week that they have the right to skip over the steps of progressive discipline and terminate an employee if the circumstances bring them there so they can do that. SEIU Local 140 leadership believes that this is one of those instances that should have gone to termination immediately. I was at the building that this custodian was moved to less than two weeks ago. This is a building that doesn't have children present on a regular basis. But that day there were tons of children. I don't know what kind of program, all over the place. And other women, other PPS employees that could fall prey to this man who was also investigated at his last job for sexual harassment. As a parent, a woman and a PPS employee, I am disgusted. I have a 12 year old daughter. Well, she's almost 12 and she's heading into middle school at Mount Tabor. The thought of having this man near any school or her or any student, any woman, any employee, just makes my blood boil. I don't even know what to say. I don't even know what to say. Why is this man allowed to work at a public School or anywhere near children. I do not care if this man wasn't actually physically touching anyone that we know of. He shouldn't be around children, period. No exceptions. I want to end with something Jane told me. She said when she was first hired, she was cornered by a custodial manager. He told her that she is young, and if anything was said or done from other custodians that make her uncomfortable, she needs to tell him so he can take care of it. This clearly says that management knows what's happening and they're just willing to sweep it under the rug. And, I mean, the manager went to her and said that PPS needs to make sure that they're following those zero tolerance policies. Policy regarding sexual harassment or any type of harassment. We want better, more robust training in regards to sexual harassment. Every year, PPS employees, we have to do our online pepper trainings. Harassment, sexual, otherwise are addressed in these pepper trainings, but they're not engaging, they're not thorough, they're not meaningful. It's the same ones every year, and it's the same questions at the end every year. And then you get your certificate that. I don't know what that actually even means. This isn't enough. PPS needs to be a safe place for all students, employees, and women and men. The culture of sexual harassment in the custodial department of PPS needs to be addressed. Now it's running rampant, and management, they're ignoring it. Thank you.

F: So I had some prepared remarks as well. I'd like to share. Again, my name is Gabe Pink. I'm a custodian as well. I'm a union steward with seiu. Regarding the policy, I do want to emphasize that what the policy is in case folks are not aware. So workplace harassment is unwelcome and offensive contact that creates an intimidating, hostile or abusive work environment. And when it is brought to their attention, administrators and supervisors must take affirmative steps, steps to stop workplace harassment, including warning discipline and recommending possible dismissal of the offending staff. And we have not seen this response. Unfortunately. We just shared two very powerful statements, but these are just two of many. I know of at least five people who I've worked with as a steward and talked to who have faced sexual harassment at pps, two of whom who have subsequently been fired for undisclosed reasons. They had made complaints to hr. So I want to be very clear, as you are aware, that HR and management is aware of what's going on and nothing is happening. And that is why we have to come here today to bring this to you. Unfortunately, it shouldn't have to be this way. But that is why we are here and that is why brave employees like Malik, who endured way more than she ever should have had to to just have a job to provide for herself and her child and were forced to quit. She's been out on forced to take sick leave the last three days because we haven't had a response from HR to protect her in her job. So she's forced to use pto, which she doesn't have anymore as a new employee, to protect herself. That's unacceptable. So I just want to summarize what we've heard and I expect to be there to be follow up and continuing engagement. We sent an email to the board which unfortunately, I don't know why, didn't make it to you all. We sent an email on last Monday. Just got an email response today from the board manager saying somehow that didn't make it to you. So that's unfortunate. I hope you receive it soon. Soon. It details some of what we're bringing to you tonight. And I want to be clear in what our demands are going forward because obviously this is stuff that has happened for far too long already and this is stuff that needs immediate action on. So we will be right there to make sure that this takes effect. So our demands for the board and for the school district are to immediately investigate all complaints of sexual harassment. This is already the Policy, but apparently it's not being followed. And to follow policy to ensure the victim is protected from further harm, including offering paid leave if necessary while the district conducts an investigation. The district must to discipline those responsible, including managers who are complicit or engage in sexual harassment themselves. Again, this is just what the policy should be. Third, we are recommending that the board perhaps pursue an independent audit of PPS's compliance with the law in regard to sexual harassment. I think by now it should be clear that this is a step that should be taken. We don't know the full extent of what's going on. We're just scratching the surface. And finally, like Veronica shared, we are asking as employees for thorough, in person comprehensive training for all of us around sexual harassment issues. We are asking for that. We hope that the district will receive our request for that. We all need that. And that is one step to addressing this rampant abuse in the workplace. And I'll just end speaking not so much to the board and the district. We hope to see action. Unfortunately, as the superintendent shared and as the district shared in a statement earlier to the press, these are just words so far and they have not followed through with action. Apparently the district is deeply committed to fostering and maintaining a safe and respectful environment. That is called gaslighting. So I want to speak to our employees and fellow supporters and I want to ask that remind us that we can't always depend on people to do the right thing if this is the case. We must support each other and fight for truly safe and dignified workplaces. This is our goal as a union. We will stand together and support each other. So I'm calling on people. If you have experienced harassment or if you are concerned about this issue, we hope you will reach out and get involved. Solidarity means we care about each other. It's well being and we feel fight to make sure no one has to endure this kind of violence and abuse, especially at work. Thank you.

D: And I just want to say thank you for, for having the courage to come out and to say something. It's never easy to stand up and say something out loud, especially like this. And this is the type of thing that people use, silence. Silence becomes the power where if you don't say anything about it then it actually gets more power and they make it seem like you should be afraid to talk about it. Nobody is going to believe you, nobody is going to care. And that's just not true. And so I want to thank you for having the courage to come out and to say something despite your belief that people may or may not care or you're not seeing what you think you ought to be seeing. You did what you were supposed to do, which was to come out and say something. And now the onus becomes on this side of the table to take a more intentional look at that. And then for us to be able to do something. To show you. I believe actions speak louder than words. To show you that it may not have looked this way before. You may not have gotten, you know, the response that you thought you were getting before. But things are changing. And so I just want to. I just want to. This is. This is never easy, but I'm glad that you did. We got to uncover the ugly so that we can get to the good. So thank you.

Next up, we will have a discussion about the 202324 school year budget following the June 23 passing of a $10.2 billion state school fund by the Oregon Legislature. If you may recall, the board approved and adopted a budget based on the initial forecast of $9.9 billion because that's what we knew at the time. Tonight is intended to be a short discussion to get a sense of what the initial thinking is on how to allocate additional resources. Superintendent Guerrero, would you like to introduce this item? I think it's next. Yeah, that's next up. Yeah. Superintendent Grau.

I: Yes. Chair Scott. Directors, we pledged to come back to you early regarding news that it appears though hasn't been officially signed by our governor that there would be new monies coming to public ed K12. So we wanted to open up a conversation but first give you a sense of about how much we're estimating we can expect share with you a few areas where it seems prudent to think about investing as a next priority. We want to have a discussion and get your thoughts on that. There's never any shortage of areas we can invest in, but we also want to balance our prioritized needs. So we have a few folks pinch hitting. As you know, our budget and finance team at the moment is non existent. But we do have Juno here, we have Jonathan and Cheryl who are going to help provide some context. So this is just a first discussion, so just keep that in mind. So we're going to get into an update and what it means for us here at pps.

start time: 719:18:20.000
end time: 721:33:30.000

J: Awesome. Thank you, Superintendent. So I'm actually going to have our budget manager here, Juno Cheng, start us off and then we'll take it apart from there.

start time: 721:39:50.000
end time: 753:37:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Thank you. Good evening, directors. As you all know, the state legislature passed the $10.2 billion budget for the state school fund, an increase of 300 million from the 9.9 billion previous. We are calculating a $15.1 million increase for PPS's portion for fiscal year 24. This is an increase from from the previous estimate of 11 million based on various factors. But the most prominent would be the admw. The latest statewide ADMW from the Oregon Department of Education shows a decrease from 676,919 to 672 145. Excuse me, excuse me. Can you explain language ADMW. That's the average daily membership and the ADMW is the weighted version of that. So that's. Can we just say students for shorthand? I know it's more complicated than that, but just for the layperson, those are sort of a rough estimate of the students in the state. Okay, thank you. Yes, absolutely. And so there is a decrease of 4,774 students, or ADMW. Now, the district's ADMW has also decreased by 198 from the last estimate. However, the statewide ADMW has dropped significantly more proportionally. This decrease in the statewide admw, or number of students, means the funding per student increased from $9,722 to $10,031, or a $309 increase per ADMW or per student.

start time: 754:10:00.000
end time: 802:44:50.000
confidence: 0.96
J: Next slide. So tonight, board, we have here, staff recommendations, some early thinking for your discussion of how we could use and propose to invest a total of $18.6 million in new resources. This is again the $15.1 million increase from the state school fund and about $3.5 million in early literacy grant funding. We anticipate receiving about $7 million over the biennium for early literacy. And in addition to, and as part of that, that bill or that, we have to provide a 25% match, which is equivalent of 1.8 million over two years, or about 900,000. And so as we are proposing and having a conversation here with the board about how we might invest in resources, we want you to consider three specific areas. The first one is to rebuild the fund balance. We are given the fiscal cliff we will be facing with the sunsetting of federal funding. We are priorities prioritizing or recommending that you prioritize your objective of maintaining between a 5 to 10% in reserves. Again, the second area of focus is on early literacy and on Division 22. And we have here Dr. Proctor, who can speak more to the details there. As you all know, House Bill 3198, which is the Early Literacy Success Initiative, was adopted by the state legislature, which will add an additional 90 million in the fund for Student Success. And the fund will focus on increasing early literacy for children from from birth to third grade, reduce early literacy disparities and increase literacy supports to educators, parents and guardians. Although district allocations have not been formally been awarded yet, PPS again is anticipating receiving about 7 million in additional revenue over this two biennium. Additionally, we are recommending $1.25 million to bolster our ability to meet the PE requirements outlined in Division 22. Finally, the staff recommends focus on PPS employee wages. As you all know, PPS is actively bargaining with three labor PAT, PFSP, SEIU and soon DCU. And so staff is proposing using up to $5.2 million in new dollars to potentially support salary and wage increases with a focus on our lowest wage workers workers. And of course if we want to discuss this one further, we can do that in bargaining executive session Chief Garcia.

confidence: 0.96
A: Our slide I think that we got or that's in board book and maybe I didn't hit reset has $10.5 million in that early literacy and division 22 support and this has 5.65. So was this.

start time: 805:35:18.000
end time: 809:18:50.000
confidence: 0.95
J: This is an accurate one. There was an update sent to you late this afternoon and the explanation is that the original slide had million in one year but it should have been split over two years over the biennium.

start time: 809:35:10.000
end time: 810:12:22.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Thank you. So the 5.65 is the right. Correct.

start time: 810:13:26.000
end time: 813:01:58.000
confidence: 0.95
H: And that was my question too when we added everything up that does equal 22.1 million but the details. Okay. There's a new slide somewhere.

start time: 813:03:34.000
end time: 813:08:06.000

A: Yes.

start time: 813:53:50.000
end time: 824:26:20.000
confidence: 0.97
J: All right. And so next slide. So we recognize this is an ever changing landscape. As the superintendent mentioned, the governor has yet to sign many of these bills into law so the final numbers are still pending. So for example we also expect to see an uptick from the student investment account but we don't have any of those numbers yet to to be able to have a conversation with you. So today will be the first of two public conversations on the topic. The expectation or the hope is that on August 22nd the board votes to votes on the proposed budget amendments per our discussions here tonight. And with that we will open it up for discussion.

start time: 825:02:40.000

C: Question earlier during the budget process we had a series of recommendations from the community Budget Review Committee and there were some conf because of when they came in of like what whether they're recommendations going forward or for that particular cycle. And while they're designed to be for this cycle not to go forward, I'm wondering whether there's been a consultation yet with the CBRC on the additional resources just given that we didn't have a lengthy discussion on their pretty thorough set of recommendations during the budget process.

start time: 836:43:00.000
end time: 840:30:04.000
confidence: 0.96
J: So the answer is no. We have not engaged with the Budget Review Committee as of these numbers are still in flux. If it is the will of the collective board for us to engage with the committee, then we're happy to do so.

start time: 840:31:32.000
end time: 843:49:22.000
confidence: 0.94
I: And I would like to add that while we have not initially for this these budgeted dollars had that conversation we did take notation of those recommendations that.

start time: 847:09:30.000
end time: 850:27:10.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I just wanted to add that I've had email conversation with Mr. Kirchner, the chair of the CBRC, and he did confirm that those recommendations were intended to be folded in next cycle. So I did want to share that.

start time: 850:41:40.000
end time: 858:21:42.000
confidence: 0.95
C: But the cbrc, it's like their process is always, has always been for this budget cycle. So it's great if they're going to be considered for next cycle as well. But I would still hope that they would say that they're designed to be part of the current year budget cycle when they're reflecting on it. So I would hope that if we have additional resources that we'd go back and look at the recommendations they made for this budget and for next cycle as well.

start time: 858:23:26.000
end time: 858:38:50.000

J: Absolutely.

start time: 859:56:30.000
end time: 891:07:22.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Sort of. It's not a well formulated question, but on the fund balance, you know, recommending at least 6.4 million, which is less than 1%, you know, and I see the table here, which is helpful, you know, and again, so, and actually I do want to make sure that I'm reading the table. The those numbers are inclusive. So so when we say adding 6.4 million, that gets us to a fund balance of $49.4 million. So again, we're currently 6.4 below that and it gets us up to 8.5. This is the part that's not well formulated. You know, we have, we had some conversations during this budget cycle around fund balance. And I will just say it's very hard for me to, you know, to vote for a fund balance. It's at that very base minimum, the 5%. But in the end, given our resource situation, I was comfortable voting for that. I would love to see our fund balance somewhere between 10 and 15%. But again, that's going to take some time to build back. So I like this recommendation and I'm thinking about all the headlines just even yesterday and in the past about student achievement. And it's still really low. We still need very sustained, much more sizable investment, you know, over the next probably five years. Right. To be recovering some of that. What's the, there's not an answer to this question. What's the right way to be thinking about these trade offs when we think about $6.4 million, which, you know, again, the reason why we have a fund balance is in case things go wrong, in case something else pops up. And, you know, we use that significantly during the pandemic, you know, to support our school schools and our students, as well as making sure it's cheaper to borrow. That's also $6.4 million that could go to additional learning supports. So I'll just put that question out there again. I know there's not an answer to it, but I'm just thinking like, what's a good orientation and mindset as we sort of consider that trade off?

start time: 891:10:26.000
end time: 900:12:40.000
confidence: 0.96
J: I'll just start with maybe a data point and then I'll turn it over to the superintendent. So to your point, you know, I'm glad the chart was helpful. So with the increase of dollars. Right. Our fund balance percentage went down to 5.07. So we are right at that 5%, you know, threshold, which is the minimum per board policy. And so, you know, I just want to point that out that we are really at that, at that bottom.

start time: 900:49:10.000
end time: 959:41:20.000
confidence: 0.97
I: I'm recalling conversations we had two years ago and again last year we made a concerted decision to. We had resources, particularly with federal monies. We put this, for the most part, all into direct student services. It was the right call. We think that's one of the reasons why we didn't see the slippage that a lot of other districts, and certainly in the national studies that are coming out in the last couple days, you see that that's the case as well. So it's a good question. But the fund balance is there because we want to be monitoring it and we would prefer it not to be minimal because we do have some cliffs coming our way. And so a lot of those learning supports, we're going to have to have a plan for sustaining the ones that we believe have been having an impact. So we're anticipating, you know, having to look at our data this coming fall and making and really prioritizing which one of those made a difference for the kids, you know, we're most concerned about. So, you know, that's the tension. Should we save a little more or should we spend it to give our kids who are furthest behind a continued opportunity to be closer to grade level? Of course, we have lots of other efforts and an array of supports and strategies in place right right now that are attempting to do that. The second category aims to do some of that by leveraging some a smaller percentage of matching funds. We can participate in this non competitive grant program to pay attention to making sure kids are reading at grade level in the earliest grades and really target our underserved students. And then the reason we have the third bucket here is because I've heard this board talk about our shared interest in making sure we're an employer of choice that are talented educators and support staff that they're also experiencing competitive wages. So each area is an important one. We'll certainly take another look at the CBRC's recommendations. Staff in some cases will certainly consider those and some cases, to be honest, maybe we had a different point of view or maybe we agree on the talk on the top on the area of need and maybe we need to do a little again, this is a first cursory thinking here. What are some other tactics that we can employ to get at that area of need? So I could go down a long wish list of what that could look like. Do we improve caseloads for our psychologists? Do we create a couple floaters in our sped department when caseloads or IEP meetings start to become overdue? So we have some relief there. I mean there's no shortage of ways that we could, you know, a little here, a little there, a little there. All of it will help to create some level of relief and more importantly, keep us on track with our obligations. Certainly with the federal idea or even what we've suggested Here with Division 22, we have a corrective action plan for PE minutes. We know that there's the legislature has sort of eased up the middle school requirement, but we've made a commitment to making sure all of our students as part of their daily experience have access to physical education. This would help accelerate making sure more kids sooner meet those requirements that we're obligated to meet. So, you know, we're trying to be pragmatic here. We're kind of just testing the temperature to see what the board's thinking is. But I think you're recognizing, you know, there's not a right answer. Each of these could serve a good purpose.

start time: 959:57:40.000
end time: 967:42:50.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Just and I'll go to my colleagues in a second. It's a little bit of a technical budget question, but I assume we would keep that when we when we say in our reserves it would not be in an we would not put it in unappropriated fund balance, meaning that it would be available during the year if we needed to. Right. There's a couple different ways we can treat that funds technically correct. We would treat as contingency which would allow the board a little bit of flexibility if there. If in case of emergency. Correct. Great. Thank you.

start time: 967:43:30.000
end time: 969:59:06.000
confidence: 0.96
I: We could come back after the first quarter once we see our data and decide we're going to set aside a little bit until we see where the need is and then and Then have some strategies to implement there.

end time: 971:13:46.000

start time: 971:15:38.000
end time: 974:53:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yes. So on the fund balance, you've got two choices there. Right. So if you chose the 75%, you move the rest somewhere else. Correct?

start time: 975:10:40.000
end time: 982:24:50.000
confidence: 0.94
J: Correct. Yeah. So if we were to. So if we were to select the 6. So we're recommending on the estimate here a 6, 4. And so at minimum. And so if. If the board decides to go higher, we would have to identify another. We would have to. You know, this is a math problem that we're trying to address. The $18.6 million.

start time: 982:27:30.000
end time: 985:56:30.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yes. And so if we decided to go with the 6.4, we could move the difference between 6.4 and 5.5 over to 1 of the other areas. Right.

confidence: 0.96
I: The total pie is 18.6. So you can decide to divide it, split it however you like. You could say you want to set aside 2% in the fund balance. It just means we would draw down the available resources in the other categories.

A: Okay, thank you.

start time: 995:35:40.000
end time: 1005:04:46.000
confidence: 0.98
C: So a couple questions and then some just things that I'm thinking about in terms of the resources on the summer school funding this year. And I'll have the same question. For the 8 million that went to grants as all the schools, as part of some of the equalization, but for summer school, was that Covid dollars or are those actually general fund dollars?

start time: 1005:07:58.000
end time: 1005:28:14.000
confidence: 0.94
J: Those were Esser dollars.

start time: 1005:29:02.000
end time: 1005:45:50.000
confidence: 0.87
I: Those were Esser dollars.

start time: 1005:47:10.000
end time: 1006:21:50.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So we potentially could have a hole next.

start time: 1006:23:50.000
end time: 1009:21:20.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Next year we will have a hole because we were burning our federal relief monies. As you know, the legislature did not act on supporting summer school this summer. So we're using our federal monies.

start time: 1010:08:20.000
end time: 1010:21:48.000
confidence: 0.79
C: So we've got a.

start time: 1010:22:44.000
end time: 1010:39:24.000
confidence: 0.95
J: So we won't have any.

start time: 1010:40:52.000
end time: 1016:20:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: We'll have a potential hole there. And then the. The monies that were the $8 million that was spread across the schools for discretionary grants to equalize. In some ways, the private fundraising that happens, that was one time money as well.

start time: 1016:54:30.000
end time: 1024:25:40.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Right. So again, if you recall, there's a few new things, new strategies we wanted to prototype. And if we see that that tactic for our schools pay dividends or had an impact, then we're going to want to figure out at what level could we sustain a continued fund like that, a school improvement grant fund as well as summer school or anything else. And so this is why having a little bit of a fund balance gives us some flexibility to consider those options moving forward.

start time: 1025:13:20.000
end time: 1031:09:06.000
confidence: 0.95
H: I have a question about the evaluation of that 1.25. I'm sorry, the 120500 to 125, if that's being evaluated, will that be evaluated you were talking about like whether that makes an impact or not. So each school building that gets the funding and what will they be evaluated on?

start time: 1031:10:18.000
end time: 1035:53:06.000
confidence: 0.98
A: That's a great question. I think we have to go back and look at and I know we've provided this information to the board around what those funds were spent on. In many cases those funds were not spent on classroom based positions. But for example, there are several schools.

start time: 1035:54:58.000
end time: 1036:27:30.000
confidence: 0.97
I: That wanted to make whole their front.

start time: 1036:28:10.000
end time: 1043:52:50.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Office support and to support multilingual families and students. Right. And so how do you evaluate the impact of that when that might not have a direct impact on academics? And so it's a question we'll have to examine very carefully and look at and in the places where they did offer some more classroom based support to see what those outcomes are and will look like. But it wouldn't be.

start time: 1044:01:20.000
end time: 1048:04:40.000
confidence: 0.97
H: I guess I was wondering about the criteria. So because each building is so unique and has unique needs, it would be hard to standardize the criteria across every building. But at some point could we coalesce around like the strategies that worked and did show results?

start time: 1048:06:40.000
end time: 1051:45:22.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Sure. And that would be work that my team would do in conjunction with Dr. Franco's team around. Because schools were asked to make sure that their investment was aligned with their school improvement plan. And that cycle of continuous improvement is.

start time: 1051:45:46.000
end time: 1053:28:50.000
confidence: 0.99
I: How they're looking at whether that investment paid off or not or had a return that would be acceptable or not.

start time: 1053:29:30.000
end time: 1054:41:22.000
confidence: 0.91
A: And not necessarily, you're correct to say that it wouldn't be appropriate for me.

start time: 1054:41:46.000
end time: 1055:48:50.000
confidence: 0.99

end time: 1066:25:50.000
confidence: 0.97
I: It is a great question. It's a good question to look at from an academic standpoint if it was a tutor, but maybe it was a non academic investment or to the example Dr. Adams gave. Maybe the survey results from our families in the spring report a greater sense of belonging because now there was someone in the front office who spoke their native language. So you know, we'll have to look at it, slice and dice it a few different ways. And then it's also a combination of other strategies in place in our schools as well. We, we also have our learning acceleration specialists and other strategies that we're employing as well.

start time: 1066:34:50.000
end time: 1067:15:30.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Director Edwards, I think you had some additional questions.

start time: 1067:16:50.000
end time: 1073:05:48.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So I want to keep track of those two big items because they seem like the summer school acceleration has been beneficial and I'm not sure we should be letting off the gas yet. And if we don't have funds to backfill that just a thought in my mind is like prioritizing that.

start time: 1073:08:04.000
end time: 1078:09:20.000
confidence: 0.96
I: I'm glad you pointed that out, Director Brim Edwards, because even though the legislature didn't act on summer school program funds, we are expecting at least a little bit of an uptick in SIA monies. So maybe that might be an opportunity to continue to target students who really need that extended fifth quarter next summer.

start time: 1078:27:00.000
end time: 1128:47:20.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I guess I would just point out about the foundation, the funds that rounded out or balanced out for schools that don't have private fundraising. I will say this budget process, we heard less from schools that didn't those schools that didn't have the capacity to raise money. And yet also, even though they had students who had been historically underserved, they still didn't get title money or something else are kind of in that middle that we I think schools had some flexibility which allowed them to just like schools that get privately raised funds can focus on things that are important to their school communities, whether it's the front office or other places. So I I'm going to be interested in that. And again, that may be a net budget cycle, but if we're talking about what we're going to be missing next year and they have just like three or four smaller items that I guess I want to just put into play and sort of the mix get staff's reaction to the Two years ago, the board created the Equitable Field Trips and Travel Fund and it was funded this year's budget 300,000, which is less than the first year, which is 500. So I potentially interested in a larger increment. And the other thing is is that fund, the funds just went to high schools. But we know that when we're approving school trips for middle school students to go for several weeks overseas that there's a big gap at the middle school level. And I know part of middle school redesign there's looking at how can we provide more equitable experiences or other experiences for our students in middle grades. So I'm interested in if that can be expanded to include some middle school experiences. And again, I don't think that's a big but most of these things aren't big Budget numbers. The other thing is I'm interested in and superintendent, we talked about this earlier, some sort of enrollment planning to because we've as other districts have also lost students. Students. What can we do to be really intentional about reaching out to students if our capture rate's gone down or what are we doing to actively bring back public school students? Which again, I don't think it is a huge budget number, but may take some resources. And I'm just going to channel Byroni, the school psychologist, so I'd be interested from staff's perspective about whether we we have really the right coverage we need. I know last time it was just a matter of resources. So what we think about that. And again, I don't need an answer now, but just I want to put some things out there and say the CBRC and I need to go back through them about ones. But I just think out of respect for the work they did that I'd want to relook at it with if we had additional resources.

start time: 1129:11:40.000
end time: 1140:17:50.000
confidence: 0.93
I: Absolutely appreciate those three areas. I was thinking of bayerni and thinking about and spoke with Chief Buno about, you know, a couple school psych floaters. And we do. We are prototyping some school marketing that we can sort of fill in the board with more to make sure we're attracting enrollment and supporting some of our schools as well. So. Yeah. And you already are thinking ahead on the move middle school redesign in Capstone. Those funds really helped out all of our high schools with making experiences possible. But again, SIA hopefully will be another opportunity to take that concept to the middle grades as well.

A: Okay. And so and I'm, I'm gonna be with Director Scott on the fund balance piece. The fact that we can have it in there to use, you know, for other other things that comes up that we see that are working. I would like to at least at the 8.5. I like that number just because we can still have access to that later on for programming as that happens. Also I would like. We keep talking about this cliff and I know it is. What is that cliff look like exactly? What are the funds that is it.

start time: 1169:10:00.000
end time: 1176:38:22.000
confidence: 0.93
J: Yeah, we can get that number. I would say the cliff is both as a result of the the Esther, you know the federal dollars coming to. To an end sunsetting and I would say then the increase the differences between the cost of doing business versus the revenue we receive is continuing to be unbalanced. And so I think that's kind of creating the second part of that cliff. So it's both and.

A: Thank you Director Hollins, we do have an answer for you. It is $36 million of Esser. So that is what our cliff is looking like as a deficit between next year and the year after each year. No, this is a 36 million dollar difference between this, this year and next year. Correct.

start time: 1189:41:10.000
end time: 1195:55:00.000
confidence: 0.95
C: There's a question. It'll come back around to the topic. But are open positions at the beginning of the year? So I assume most of the positions in last year's budget get budgeted for a full year or do you do a like we estimate we're going to have a Q2 hire or Q1 or are they mostly like a full year?

start time: 1196:53:20.000
end time: 1198:41:44.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So for budgeting purposes we do count the FTE or the employees for the.

start time: 1198:41:52.000
end time: 1208:51:26.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Full fiscal year for the full year. And then this is a question maybe just for the future. Unless Chief Reese knows right off hand like how many open positions we have. I'm just, I'm curious about. I know last year we had a significant underspend some point in time just because of when people got hired in the year. And I'm thinking about those one time funds being added to our fund balance or reserves. Just I'm curious what that you're talking.

start time: 1208:51:58.000

Yeah, I really like majority of what I see here. I think that makes a lot of sense. I do want to reiterate what a few of you have already said before, that it would be nice to follow up with the CBRC and hear what they have to say as well. You know, just, you know, it'd just be good to. In case there's any holes that we missed or whatnot. And also, is that. Would that be something that we could see before? I mean, I assume we would see that before the next meeting. Depends. Like, but like I'm just curious about. Guess not really sort of a question, but like what kind of. Do we have a plan in place to. Can we have a plan in place to reach out to them and have them review and be able to see that review?

B: All right, thank you. And then the last comment is that I also think that school psychologists and stuff is huge because I mean they play a huge role and they cover, you know, they just mean a lot to a lot of students and I think they're kind of effective multiplier in my mind.

I'll end this. I. And I'm not sure if any media is reporting on this or not. This feels like good news because we're adding some money to some much needed programs. But I don't want anyone to forget the larger context. The state budget was $10.2 billion. That is a cut from current service level. So again, we had to pass an even more reduced budget. So this feels like a win, but it's just good to keep it in context that it's not. And the reason why it's not is because our governor and our legislature did not prioritize public education as part of this year's budget process. Full stop up.

start time: 1259:08:16.000
end time: 1275:02:28.000
confidence: 0.97
J: So as a, as a next step and just want to make sure for staff to prepare for the, the next conversation on August 8th. We will continue to refine these numbers as we get more information coming in from the state. So you, we will update those numbers in with you including hopefully the, the dollars from the student investment account. The second thing is what we heard tonight at least is to have staff look at possibilities around school psychologists looking at the field trip equity funding. And then as the superintendent shared, we do have some work in play around enrollment planning and we'll provide more information so the board is aware what how we're thinking about that. I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything else in terms of what we should be thinking about.

I just, I was looking for the like overall number just because I'm thinking if some of those don't get if they're budgeted for full year positions but they're not actually hired until later in the year, there's some one time savings. Yeah. I don't need to know now but it'd be great to know better if you can. Thanks.

D: And I just want to be specific about the, the travel part that that's a twofold that she's looking what, what I heard because I'm beyond high schools me is both the middle school as well as the high school but also the number went down. So is there a possibility for that number to come back up? And since we're going to be going since we're possibly looking at going further meaning that we're going into the middle schools, then it may need to go higher than the 500 that we did just with the, just with high school. But if we're going to be inclusive of middle school then we may need to find out what are the trade offs. And I want to be very clear that what I'm. I know what I'm asking for. Where it may not seem like a lot but you eat an elephant a bite at a time and eventually if we keep taking Bites. If we keep taking bites, then there's nothing left. So what does it look like though? What am I going to lose? What am I sacrificing to get this, this higher number of. Let's say I'm just throw it out there. How do we get a million dollars? Give 500,000, you know, 500 to the middle schools and 500 to the high schools so that we can not lose, but go up. I feel like a million is easy. So let's, let's get it.

I: Thank you, Director Green. We've certainly heard this. I don't think we even utilized the full amount last year. We're going to put assistance to Calvert and a whole team around this. We know our high schools, you know, were able to really have a lot of experiences. So, you know, we'll have to sort of pencil it out to see how much it will take to make sure our middle schools, you know, can incorporate some funding for capstone and field trips as well. I don't want to lose the underlying big point that Director Hollins made. There's a. There's going to be a $36 million gap going into next year. The fact that we have this level of fund balance is partly due. I pat myself on the back of the team here is we took some evasive action mid year kind of constrain activity. And so we have the number that we have now. But it'll be prudent to pump some money into that fund balance so that next spring we're not talking about all the reductions to the same degree.

Specifically, the levy provides funding for approximately 800 teaching positions a year. Members of the committee, just for the record, have been Director Hollins, Scott Green and myself. The committee considers. I'm just going to provide an overview of what we just. The high level we discussed and the recommendation that is coming to the board. So the committee considered a variety of potential election dates to refer this to voters, including this November's election and the May and November 2024 election. And the committee is recommended referring to the board a local option renewal levy for the November 2023 election. Consideration of the voters of a levy renewal at the November election versus a later election will provide important information about available resources and some certainty hopefully in our long term budget planning versus having to create different budgetary planning scenarios if we actually go later. So tonight we're bringing to the board the draft documents for a referral in the board materials of the draft resolution we would consider at the next board meeting that we consider and vote on at the next board meeting. Also included in the board materials are the ballot capture question summary and explanatory statement. And all these are documents which are part of the referral of the measure to the voters. The local option committee also considered whether it should be a renewal or proposed increase and we'd had some conversations as a full board about that and we also had multiple discussions about what the funds would be used for. The committee is recommending that we ask the voters to approve a five year local option renewal levy that will be a continuation of the $1.99 per $1,000 of assessed value. This means the tax rate remains the same and the rate would not increase. The levy revenue would be used for teaching positions, classroom and other school supports. They'll also, as we have in past local option levies had a community budget review committee that will provide independent oversight so the funds are spent as was intended and the CBRC will publish publish an annual report. In addition, the referral would specify that no levy funds will be spent on administration and that performance auditing of school district programs also will be done. In order to place the levy on the November ballot, the board needs to file a notice of election no later than Friday, August 18th with the deadline of actually filing. So we could actually file it on September 7th to meet the August 18th deadline. Are you paying attention to these dates? The board will need to consider and vote on the measure at its Aug. 8 board meeting. So in addition, as part of the process for filing to renew the district's local option, the Board of Education is required to give notice to the Tax Supervising and Conservation Commission, also known as tscc. And we need to notify them that we're that we're planning to file a levy and explain the reasons for the levy. The TSCC is a legislative created advisory body that oversees budgets, taxes, debt and management practices of the Monolam county taxing districts. The notice to TSCC must be given 30 days prior to the filing date for the elections. So no later than July 19, 2023. After receiving the notice, the TSCC will notice and conduct a public hearing to discuss the proposed levy and will accept public comment at that meeting. So the purpose of tonight's agenda is to share the draft language with the board and broader community prior to our plan consideration and vote on the local option no levy. And that's going to happen at the Aug. 8 board meeting. And the second purpose of this agenda item is to share the potential referral of the full board and community prior to our notice and holding of the meeting of the about the levy with the Tax Supervising and Conservation Commission. The language and the resolution and other materials has been updated from previous levies and is not significantly different from previous local option levy referrals that have been referred to voters in the past and been overwhelmingly approved. And in essence, the the thrust of this local option is to continue to be a critical part of our annual operating budget, which is different from our capital budget. It's also important to note there'll be one final round of editing to make sure we are within the prescribed word counts and to finalize the exact language at a couple points in the living materials. We there's specific, very specific, specific numbers of words that we can include in our referral and we'll make sure that we get our message across within the required word numbers. But there may be some, there may be some minor adjustments. We'll also send the final proposed materials the board in advance of the August 8th meeting so you can all review and ask specific questions or raise concerns prior to that meeting because that will be the meeting in which we are required to refer if we want it to be on the November ballot. So with that, I would just say that's the background and the recommendation from the committee and it's setting us up for a vote at the Aug. 8 meeting, which will be our one and only chance if we're going to refer before the August 18 deadline in order to meet the November election, which is the recommendation. Thank you.

C: So certainly the board has an important role to play in the referral, but once it's referred, the board has a very important role to play because staff, at a certain point, the staff can provide factual information about the referral, but board members and other community leaders are the ones that are going to need to lead the campaign, raise the funds and actively advocate it for it, which is a different role against staff can provide factual information but not advocate for it. So the board will have a very important role to play and I've always played in all the renewals. I think we're well positioned heading into this. Our community understands how important the teaching positions and the other positions this funds and the role that the local option plays in the. And the ballot.

start time: 1452:51:30.000

A: Great. Any questions for Director Burma Edwards? Okay, next up and I think our final item for tonight we will vote on the consent Consent agenda. Board members, if there are any items you'd like to pull for discussion, we will set those aside for the next time we meet. But first, Ms. Bradshaw, are there any changes to the consent agenda? And board members, are there any items you would like to pull from the consent agenda? Director Wong. And we will have time to discuss as well. But Director Wong, go ahead.

A: If you're not going to pull, let me get the motion on the table and then we'll open it up for board discussion. I'll come right back to you. So, did you want to pull anything? Director? I want to pull the PAE Consulting Corp. Contract. Okay. Are we clear which one that is? That is PAE Consulting Corp developing a decarbonization roadmap. Your mic's not on. Oh, developing a decarbonization roadmap to help district prioritize emission reduction measures needed to reach 30. I don't see a number 2040 and 2050 goals. I'm just not seeing it in our. In our list. That's why I just want to make sure we're clear with staff. Do you know which one we're talking about? Great. Okay, so we will pull that and it will be come back on the August 8th meeting. Okay. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt the consent agenda?

end time: 1551:59:54.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, I guess I decided not to move to poll. The one I'm talking about is the Smuckers Food Service one. And the part of the reason I decided not to pull is because I didn't want to pull the rug under people and cause trouble. But I do have a big ask one of the this. In case you're not familiar, it's the one that is provided. District says right here, the brief. The USDA commodity processed peanuts into ready serve products. I guess one of the issues I have with this one is a safety issue. I personally have seen both in my time working and also out of school, having seen students have to go to the emergency room because of peanut exposure. And if you're not familiar, you know, there's. Food allergies is a growing problem. It's sadly growing, especially peanut allergy. And all of them come with different risks, but especially peanut. There's some that are way more than others. And peanuts come with a risk of anaphylactic shock that can range anywhere from hives all over the body to a kid's throat seizing up and they're not able to breathe anymore. So I kind of asking questions with some people in the district, with a director of nutritional services and kind of just kind of get some information. I kind of want to share some ideas and also kind of an ask. I guess my big issue is that, you know, I'm not in any desire to want to regulate or put in policies like regulate what parents send their kids to school with. But I do think that as a district district, we can work to make it safer for a lot of our kids, especially the ones that typically feel excluded because of food allergies. You know, just. Even if it's just a little thing, a little bit safer is a win, I think. So, you know, in talks with. With people in district, it sounds like there we. There's potential for change in terms of like, you know, like I wouldn't want to change unless it was like a win, win, win situation. Right? Like where it's just we can change smartly, but also perhaps even find a local option and even even healthier options too, because, you know, this is processed food, which, you know, even though a lot of kids depend on it, it would be nice to find healthier options. So I guess my. My ask is for superintendent Guerrero if, if you'd be willing to. I would love to talk to you or ask if you would be interested in considering potentially other options. Because I know with this contract it says with the option for renew every year, I would personally love it to see if we can find an alternative or a different option before renew for next year or in place of renewing for next year. So I guess that's my ask. Ask is if you'd be willing to explore some potential replacements or options or even other products that they can provide. And you know, the other thing also the reason, another benefit that could possibly be Is, you know, as I was kind of asking around, it seems like, you know, there's a lot of burden on cafeteria staff having to, you know, separate foods with allergies, you know, especially peanut products and, and having to have separate dishwashers or separate processes or disposable dishes and stuff like that. You know, if this could even mean like less of a burden on them, I think that would be, I mean, if we could slowly start eliminating, you know, I would like to slowly eliminate some of the more dangerous allergens because in my mind it's a safety issue. But yeah, that's my rant. And I was wondering if.

I: Thank you. Just to respond to Director Wong, of course, always open into having a conversation about our food allergy administrative directive. It might be a good time to query our families because food allergies are becoming rather prevalent. If it's time to take another look at. And is there an alternative? And I'd certainly want to include our nutrition services and our health services staff as well in those conversations. So, you know, this doesn't have to be a forever thing.

H: I just also really want to appreciate you for bringing that up because those I've seen kids that have experienced that particular food allergy and I know that they're growing, they're more prevalent. I'm just wondering if we could. Smucker is a huge corporation, if we could work with them to either remove peanuts from the food product or process them in a peanut free facility, which they do have now.
