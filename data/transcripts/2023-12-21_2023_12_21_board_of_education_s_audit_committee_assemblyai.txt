A: Hi, I'm Angie Peterman. I am one of the consultants, ANC Consulting, along with Claire, that's been helping with the audit. Great. Thank you. Did we get everybody online? The first item on our agenda is a presentation of the audit results for the annual comprehensive financial report. The supporting documentation was just posted on board books, so you should have it in there. But I wouldn't expect that you've read through it yet. I think it was just posted. Did you want to. Go ahead?

start time: 31:52:40.000
end time: 37:18:56.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So I'll take sort of a quick overview of the financial statements, if that's okay. Just sort of, sort of maybe some new things that are in there. Because there was a new accounting standard implemented by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board that I'll refer to as GAS Feed. Just colloquial. That's how it's known.

start time: 37:20:08.000
end time: 37:31:12.000
confidence: 0.85
A: Okay. What is it?

start time: 37:31:36.000
end time: 42:18:30.000
confidence: 0.90
C: What is the African gasb. So Gay gasb? Governmental Accounting Standards Board. So they are the ones who set the accounting rules for all municipal governments in the United States.

start time: 42:20:30.000
end time: 42:34:50.000
confidence: 0.42
A: Excellent.

start time: 42:55:10.000
end time: 55:46:20.000
confidence: 0.96
C: And then we'll go over a letter that was handed out for the people there also was posted. I'll just start off a lot of the paper or pages, electronic pages that you see in front of us. It's not our work. It's the work of the district. And the staff there did a lot of work to put this together, so. So I'd like to thank them through this process as well. So the first page that would be. That would be ours. That may not be in the document itself yet is the internal audit report.

start time: 56:51:20.000
end time: 57:24:20.000
confidence: 0.90
A: And that's behind the letter?

start time: 57:32:40.000
end time: 64:07:54.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Yeah, it's behind the. It's behind. So you'll have the transmittal letter. You'll have awards that the district has earned for financial reporting from the gfoa. So the Government Finance Officers association and I always mess up.

start time: 64:10:42.000
end time: 65:54:02.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So is this under TKW reports 20, 23? It's 24 pages, yeah. Okay, great.

start time: 65:55:46.000
end time: 66:08:42.000
confidence: 0.79
C: So. So there's.

start time: 66:09:46.000
end time: 66:36:30.000
confidence: 0.87
A: That's an inboard books.

start time: 66:55:30.000
end time: 80:53:28.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So there's four separate reports in there that are letters from us to get attached to the. That will be inserted into the financial statements. There is also a schedule of findings and question costs, which I'll go into as well. And then there's also the communication with those charged with governance the audit results, which is also in paper in front of you. So we'll just sort of go through the. Through the annual Comprehensive Financial Report, also known as the actfir, then the Single Audit reporting, and then we'll go through the letter. If you have any questions at any time, feel free to ask. I will. Sometimes I forget that not everybody's an accountant. So.

start time: 80:54:24.000
end time: 81:55:36.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yes, I think there are very few accountants in the room.

start time: 81:56:48.000
end time: 106:07:22.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yeah. So feel free. Hey, I can ask. Answer your question. So the first report that is ours is the Independent auditor's report. A change that they made last year, which I think was a good one, is that they moved the opinion right up to the front because that's what everybody cares about. The good news, clean, unmodified opinion for the district. So that is, things are good. These financial statements, in our opinion, based on the test work that we did, and as Young and his team can tell you, it's a lot of test work. So. And then it gives a little bit about how we come to that conclusion and then responsibilities and then what responsibility and what our opinion is on the different sections of it. So you have financial statements and then you have supplementary information. Required supplementary information. And we give sort of. In relation to opinions on the budget schedules. But then there's other stuff in there that we could say we don't give an opinion on, like the statistical information provided by the District. So we keep it more on the financial side of our opinion. And the other stuff we say, yes, it's there and we're not aware of anything that makes us think that it's wrong and it doesn't contradict anything that we know.

start time: 106:09:06.000
end time: 106:17:30.000
confidence: 0.50
A: Okay.

start time: 106:18:50.000
end time: 106:29:30.000
confidence: 0.99
C: Essentially.

start time: 106:30:50.000
end time: 106:39:38.000
confidence: 0.56
A: Okay.

start time: 106:41:14.000
end time: 164:20:26.000
confidence: 0.95
C: That's sort of the layman terms of all the words. Moving on in the financial report, you'll then get to the management discussion and analysis. This is the section that we encourage everybody to read is sort of what it says it is it's management's discussion and analysis of the changes from last year to this year. So it gives a comparative of the information of the statement of net position, which is the district's balance sheet on a full basis, and the statement of activities, which is the district's income statement on a full basis. So that's with all the liabilities and assets according to the rules in there. And so it's a good place to start. It's if you're not going to read all pages of the report, it provides a summary of those. So on page 20 you'll have the summary of the net position, comparing last year to this year's numbers and then some discussion on why they changed. And then the statement of activities is on page 22. So this is once again your income statement and the changes from last year and then some discussion about why. Moving on to the statement of net position, you'll see the first of a couple new items for there. So last year the district implemented GASB statement 87, which is the, which was the new lease standard. The district did not have any lease payable on the lease side. They had some lease or arrangements that got recorded last year, but not the lease C. So this is where you signed an agreement to rent a building or a piece of equipment or copiers or whatever building or equipment. And so you now record what they call an intangible right to use. So that means that you have access to use that how you see fit within the rules of the agreement for a certain length of time. So GASB decided that you should recognize that to make it similar to remove the difference between whether you bought the copier or the building or the equipment or you leased it. Essentially in their mind, if you look at their basis of conclusion, it's the same transaction. Okay, so you got an asset for money essentially is what it's trying to do. Gasb statement 96, which was implemented this year for subscription based IT arrangements. So subscriptions. So this is a lot of it, your curriculum, a lot of that's electronic, your software systems. In the past you would have bought these things. Now you're signing agreements to use them over a certain length of time. So similar to leases. In fact, a lot of the language is very similar to the lease standard. You capitalize that right to use.

start time: 164:23:28.000
end time: 165:05:42.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Again, is that like a licensing then?

start time: 165:08:46.000
end time: 174:35:12.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Sort of, yeah. So you pay a certain amount of money to say we're going to use this equipment for over five years. So let's say you pay a million dollars. So over the next five years you recognize on a full accrual basis 200,000 of it. So a piece of it for every year that you use it. Yes, you straight line that. Because once again, that's the length of time that the district was able to use it. So it didn't seem right to recognize all that expense according to GASB in the year that you bought it, where.

start time: 174:35:36.000
end time: 174:53:00.000
confidence: 0.87
E: You pay for it.

start time: 174:58:00.000
end time: 178:20:00.000
confidence: 0.96
C: On the flip side there for both of these is so what's the other side of the asset? It's a liability. So on the next page you have the liabilities page.

start time: 178:22:40.000
end time: 178:56:16.000
confidence: 0.88
A: And can you reference your page numbers?

start time: 178:56:48.000
end time: 199:52:02.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I'm sorry, page 30. So page 29 of the is the statement of net position. That's the asset. And page 30 is the liabilities. You have lease and subscription payable. These are the counterbalance. So if you don't pay cash up front for all these things, you have a liability to pay for them. So that liability is measured at the present value of those future payments. So there's an management. So your accounting department has determined an incremental borrowing rate for each of these based on the length of time and, and when it was entered into to discount those future payments back to what, what it would be essentially if you had to pay for it. All right now. So this once again replicates if you borrowed the money, what would you have? You would have principal payments and interest. So that's now how those are reflected in the financial statements. So you come out. Yes. Yeah.

start time: 199:54:26.000
end time: 200:51:14.000
confidence: 0.79
D: As if you've just done the whole bunch of first.

start time: 200:52:42.000
end time: 209:18:06.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah. But it represents future payments of the district is required by the agreements that they've signed to make. So in Gatsby's mind, they made it very similar to debt. So that's sort of what I like to as a reference point. They're not exactly the same, but your right to use assets are like capital assets. And your subscription and lease payables is like your debt, long term debt. You have to pay it over time.

start time: 209:19:18.000
end time: 209:34:06.000
confidence: 0.98
A: That does help.

start time: 209:36:38.000
end time: 209:48:10.000
confidence: 0.82
F: So.

start time: 211:10:30.000
end time: 219:42:30.000
confidence: 0.96
C: The Next page, page 31 is your statement of activities. You don't see too many changes in there. But once again, some differences is that those payments that used to be made and expensed all the way regarding subscriptions are now taken out, recorded as principal payments. And now you have more interest there as well. And then the amortization is now recorded in expense. Just read that.

start time: 219:43:10.000
end time: 219:54:50.000
confidence: 0.79
A: Okay.

start time: 220:16:30.000
end time: 264:23:54.000
confidence: 0.96
C: The next section is the fund financial statements. I won't get too into into those. And then there's the notes on page 53. It gives a probably in a much more succinct manner summarizes the new accounting standard and what they're trying to do there. Once again, the financial statement notes help explain all the numbers that are in the statement of net position and the statement of activities. So there's a lot of detail that goes into that and there's a lot of information that supports that. So that's where most of your financial statements are. It's in the notes, but it gets really in the weeds. Following the notes is the section for required supplementary information. So these include certain schedules for your pension liabilities with PERs and then also the district's own pension liabilities and those also your other post employment benefits, also known as opeb. So OPEB and additionally there are required budget to actuals for your general fund and your special revenue funds are there. Following the required supplementary information is supplementary information which again is your budget to actual schedules for the district. And then following that is your statistical section. So that's where it has a lot of 10 year history of financial information. It has some operating ratios and statistics there. So once again a lot of good information. But a lot of that is coming from the district itself as sort of to give context of how the environment that the district is operating. And then the last piece that will be part of this annual financial report once it's all put together is the independent auditor's report in compliance with Oregon state regulations. Some pages there.

start time: 264:25:22.000
end time: 265:00:42.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Oops, I'm looking for that too.

start time: 265:03:46.000
end time: 299:03:54.000
confidence: 0.96
C: It's in the TKW report packet. I think it's your second report there. Maybe the independent auditors report on compliance and internal controls over financial reporting based on an audit of financial statements performed in accordance with Oregon state regulations. So state law has what they call organ minimum standards. So this covers certain things that's covered in the report. So making sure you're putting your deposits that whereas allowed by law. So you can't just pick any bank. It has to be certain banks that could support pretty much trying to minimize the risk to municipal governments. There's restrictions on how much debt that the district can take. Budget law, that's where a lot of this comes in. Funding from outside sources, investments, state school funds, public contracting law and lot goes on. So these are all requirements by state law. And one of the requirements as a municipal auditor is that we have to check these things and give a report to the state to you guys to put in with your financial statements so the Secretary of State knows whether or not you're complying. The good news here is that we are not aware of any exceptions to Oregon minimum standards.

start time: 299:06:02.000
end time: 299:22:02.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Excellent.

start time: 299:24:26.000
end time: 300:22:30.000

start time: 302:38:34.000
end time: 306:17:12.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Yeah. So we've had like teachers experience which that can get messy just. And some of it may be luckily draw. But we tested and we could and we did not find anything in the sample that we selected. So that is very good news.

A: Appreciate it.

start time: 318:50:28.000
end time: 341:40:10.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yep. Schedule of expenditures of federal awards. So this is because the district expends over 750,000 and they do it by more than a little bit. The district's required to get what they call a single audit. So this is an audit of federal awards. And it's pretty prescriptive by the federal government. The Office of Management and Budget OMB sends out a compliance supplement every year which is around 1,000 pages for telling us auditors of what we should do and how we should do it. And that's in addition to Uniform Guidance, which is the actual federal code. So. So the first report that would be in there because one of the requirements of Uniform Guidance is that you are audited underneath not only generally accepted auditing standards, but also governmental auditing standards, which is auditing standards, what we call the yellow book, which is put out by the Government Accountability Office of the federal government. So once again. Yeah. Yeah.

start time: 341:41:30.000
end time: 342:36:30.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So I don't see that letter in posted.

G: I'm wondering if. If the latest version is up. I just noticed that what we have posted in board books has many, many Mandy. Pages just marked, drafted, are blank.

start time: 347:41:00.000
end time: 348:50:40.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Well, I think this might be in a separate pack with the other TKW reports.

start time: 349:05:00.000
end time: 350:52:40.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Oh, I see. Yeah, there are a lot of blank. It looks like placeholders.

start time: 351:41:00.000
end time: 366:13:12.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah. So we issued another report that is a report on internal controls over financial reporting and compliance and other matters based on audit financial standards performed in accordance with governmental audit standards. To summarize, we have to look at and report as part of Our audit. If we become aware of any deficiencies in internal control, we have to report on that and put that in and let them know. So this is where this reports let readers know that there was one material weakness that was found during the audit. And this was. And then referencing the schedule of findings and question costs.

start time: 366:14:16.000
end time: 366:59:00.000

start time: 372:24:10.000
end time: 376:29:50.000
confidence: 0.93
C: So we'll go over that finding here in a little bit once we get to the schedule. Findings in question, cost. Okay. The next report in that document, the Uniform Guidance. What page do you have? What page that is on?

start time: 376:58:10.000
end time: 378:56:10.000
confidence: 0.99

start time: 394:15:12.000
end time: 399:00:34.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So. So this is the. Our report on the actual testing of the federal awards. We'll go over the. Which programs it was. But there was four. There were four major programs. So that's a lot of testing for the District.

start time: 399:02:32.000
end time: 399:15:30.000
confidence: 0.35
A: Mm.

start time: 399:50:30.000
end time: 422:10:22.000
confidence: 0.96
C: The good news is that we were after. After we finished testing, no findings as a result of our single audit. So we found no control deficiencies over compliance of federal compliance with Uniform Guidance, and no compliance findings either. So that is very good news. Once again, the opinions on the first. Then it goes into the basis. Talks about responsibilities. It mentions that there is a report. It goes over internal controls. If we found anything, that would have been noted there as well. And then the last section is our report on the schedule of expenditures of federal. Of federal awards required by the Uniform Guidance. And this just says in relation to the financial statements where we believe that these are materially correct. So as. As part of Our audit of the financial statements and of course some other procedures over it. The CEFA is fairly stated following that report in the TKW report PDF. I'm assuming there's the. Then the schedule of findings and question costs.

start time: 422:11:26.000
end time: 423:44:30.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Yeah yeah. So that's looking like page 12 of 24.

start time: 423:46:30.000
end time: 493:20:30.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah. So I'll let you instead of flipping back the the PDF of the of the report itself, the CEFA is there. You can look at all the different programs with the amounts that were spent during the year. It was up from to from about 94.6 million last year to about 110 million this year. So there's that. So the first page on the schedule findings in question costs is a good summary of pretty much everything I've talked abouts or will talk about. There was one material weakness identified over internal for internal controls over financial reporting. No material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal controls over major federal programs. We have no audit findings required to be reported within Uniform Guidance. There's the four programs that we audited as major programs. So the Emergency Connectivity Fund program ideas. So Special Education Grants states and Special Education Preschool Grants, Supporting Effectiveness Instruction state grants and then the ever favorite education Stabilization Fund. Then we get to the finding. So as we are going through the through the audit we found two transactions that were recorded incorrectly in the trial balance presented to us. So these were not the usual transactions. Most grants that the district receives is done on a reimbursement basis. So you spend the money, you file the report, you get the money. So these, both of these transactions involved unearned revenue. So that means that you got cash but you hadn't applied it to a federal award yet so. Or a state grant award, so whatever grant. So one of them involved a federal award, one of them involved a state estate grant. So these weren't your normal transactions. They did not represent any cash misstatement. It was just how they recorded those transactions. So the first one was the to Clarify that was 909,000 304,000 so that's 9.3 million. And the second one was 119,000 899,000 or roughly just under 120 million. So so at the end of the day the district did correct these. So the correction has been reflected in those financial statements. While going through this and can can step in at any time here to expand. There's been some turnover in the accounting department, actually a fair amount of turnover. There's vacant positions so you have new people trying to do more. So there's some of that There. There was also some lack of communication with the accounting department that departments went and did things without telling the finance department. And that will also caused difficulty to get things recorded correctly the first time. And then just like I said, these weren't the usual transactions that the district normally enters into. They happen, but they aren't. And there's processes for them, but it's not the rote routines type of stuff that they, that they do.

start time: 494:05:30.000
end time: 498:42:06.000
confidence: 0.93
A: So is. Is part of this. So there's. There's a lot. There's turnover and maybe a lack of communication. Is there some part of this that once someone has been in a job for a while, this kind. It's a recording error is what it sounds like. They're recording errors.

start time: 498:42:38.000
end time: 498:51:42.000
confidence: 0.93
C: But yeah.

start time: 498:52:46.000
end time: 500:16:10.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Is it something that you would expect once people were brought on board and onboarded and were familiar with their work?

start time: 500:25:10.000
end time: 507:51:18.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I. I would expect so also if you were there for the whole transaction. So some of these was recorded on by one person, the original transaction. And then. And then the reversing entry to actually record it was done by another one. So you had sort of a changing of the guard. And so yeah, I would expect that this. If the people there now ran into this transaction again, because we've had a lot of discussions.

start time: 507:52:54.000
end time: 508:06:50.000
confidence: 0.75
A: Okay.

start time: 508:56:40.000
end time: 512:24:20.000
confidence: 0.94
C: It wouldn't happen again. But it is a material, some big numbers and so it, it's learning.

start time: 512:34:00.000
end time: 512:43:12.000
confidence: 0.71
A: Okay.

start time: 512:44:16.000
end time: 512:54:24.000
confidence: 0.95
C: But.

start time: 512:57:12.000
end time: 513:27:12.000
confidence: 0.62
A: Well, we're learning in citizenship, so.

start time: 513:28:56.000
end time: 513:36:00.000
confidence: 0.85
C: Yeah.

start time: 513:37:20.000
end time: 517:16:30.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Can I, Can I ask a question? Was the. Just going into a little bit more detail. Was the revenue recorded just recorded in the wrong way or the wrong place? 130 million roughly not recorded at all in the financial statements originally.

start time: 517:27:30.000
end time: 539:57:48.000
confidence: 0.97
C: One was recorded twice. So the 9.3 million was recorded in one fund, but they wanted it recorded in another fund to be in accordance with how things normally happen. And so it just got recorded twice, canceled each other out. So there was no impact on fund balance or cash or anything like that. It was just trying to clear out that unearned revenue that was recorded at the last year. So sort of that transaction of how do we get it out of one place and. And where we want to record it now, now that we know what it is and what we want to do with it. The other one was cash that came in the door and was recorded all as revenue prematurely. So it was a timing issue. Eventually this should be revenue for the district. The 120 million was for the relocation of a middle school. Middle school. So the state legislature told DAs to make a grant to the district. They made the grant and in that grant agreement, it's supposed to be spent on certain things. So you don't earn the money until you actually spend it on relocating the school. Does that answer your question?

start time: 539:58:44.000
end time: 548:54:28.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Yeah, it does. I guess I just want to be really clear because I think. And I just want to make sure I'm not. I don't want to understate the issue, but what I think I hear you saying on this state grant is that we got $119.9 million and our accounting staff recorded that as revenue into the district, but because of GASB rules, because we hadn't. Well, actually, I'm not going to try and explain why the Gasby rules exist as they do. That should have been recorded as. That should have been recorded as unearned revenue.

start time: 548:56:04.000
end time: 549:02:44.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Yeah.

start time: 549:03:32.000
end time: 549:21:08.000
confidence: 1.00
G: Is that correct?

start time: 549:24:04.000
end time: 549:36:00.000
confidence: 0.96
E: So.

start time: 549:41:00.000
end time: 556:22:06.000
confidence: 0.97
G: And again, tell me if I'm. Tell me if I'm. If I'm understating the problem, but this is really like, we got $120 million, we put it in category A. GASB says it should have been in category B. And we didn't catch that right away. And so that stayed on our books. And that is part of this audit process. It became clear that it should have been in category B. And so we've moved it to category B, essentially.

start time: 556:22:38.000
end time: 556:32:50.000
confidence: 0.99
C: Yes.

start time: 556:50:30.000
end time: 557:05:50.000
confidence: 0.80
G: Okay.

start time: 557:08:30.000
end time: 558:03:10.000
confidence: 0.89
A: So I love how you simplified that, Andrew.

start time: 558:05:50.000
end time: 562:36:00.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like I said, there's no cash missing. There's nothing that wasn't recorded. There was no cash that wasn't recorded. And this is just. How do you recognize the revenue and expense associated with those transactions?

start time: 562:44:20.000
end time: 563:50:04.000
confidence: 0.99
G: And it shows up as a material weakness and not just a deficiency because of the size of the grant.

start time: 563:50:52.000
end time: 564:00:28.000
confidence: 0.99
E: Is that.

start time: 564:02:44.000
end time: 564:08:44.000
confidence: 0.68
C: Yeah.

start time: 564:09:32.000
end time: 564:23:08.000
confidence: 0.90
E: From your perspective.

start time: 564:24:44.000
end time: 578:29:42.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah. Okay, so quantitatively, 120 million means something to the district. And also we're also not looking at it just on the district as a whole. Our opinion, which I can go into a little bit further. The opinion on the financial statements is on opinion units. So we give an opinion unit on each major fund. So each fund we have to look at. Is that fun. Materially stated as well. So that's where something may not be material to the district in total, but to the fund that it was recorded in. It will. It would be material, but only if.

start time: 578:30:06.000
end time: 578:56:38.000
confidence: 0.98
B: It'S a major fund or.

start time: 578:58:54.000
end time: 579:24:22.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Well, you have significant.

start time: 579:26:06.000
end time: 579:41:10.000
confidence: 0.99
B: For all funds.

start time: 579:42:30.000
end time: 594:09:20.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Well, you have the opinion units are government for the district anyways. This isn't all. So the opinion is governmental activities, major funds and all aggregate other information which for the district is only the internal service. The internal service fund. So. So pretty Much all the funds, at least at the reporting level. So you have a lot of sub funds that the district uses to help manage the finances. But at that top level, pretty much every fund is its own opinion unit in essence. So we have to look at each one of them individually and then we also have to look at everything in total. Thanks.

start time: 594:28:20.000
end time: 596:41:20.000
confidence: 0.97
B: I think that the second part that Andrew simplified for us makes sense now. But I still don't understand the expenditure piece.

start time: 596:56:10.000
end time: 608:38:50.000
confidence: 0.98
C: So as the staff was trying to get the revenue where they wanted it, they knew that fund balance needed to come down to zero in that. So in essence they recorded the revenue and the expenses and then recorded the revenue to zero it out and then recorded the revenue again in another fund with the fund that they wanted it to. So they were trying to get to the right place and on the balance sheet they did. So this is an income statement impact, at least for the 9.3. The 120 million did have the balance sheet impact because of the unearned revenue, which is considered a liability.

start time: 610:21:50.000
end time: 610:46:50.000
confidence: 0.86
A: And then the recommendation.

start time: 611:40:40.000
end time: 619:38:14.000
confidence: 0.98
C: So the recommendation is we like to leave it as broad. You guys know your business better than we do and how the operations. So we just say, well, district policies should be implemented to prevent this going forward. Then of course we talk with and Tracy and the other people in your accounting department. They came up with a corrective action plan which we reviewed.

start time: 619:39:02.000
end time: 619:53:58.000
confidence: 0.91
E: I don't know if.

start time: 619:56:14.000
end time: 621:34:50.000
confidence: 0.87
F: Yes, that's also posted in the materials. Yet another document.

start time: 622:09:50.000
end time: 622:22:10.000
confidence: 0.93
C: So.

start time: 622:51:10.000
end time: 623:04:06.000
confidence: 1.00
A: Excellent.

start time: 623:05:58.000
end time: 624:57:58.000
confidence: 0.94
C: So yeah. So the. So district management has responded. They have a plan forward.

start time: 625:00:14.000
end time: 625:14:30.000
confidence: 0.97
A: They concur.

start time: 625:15:50.000
end time: 633:44:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: They concur. So sort of an unfortunate incident. But it all got corrected at the end of the day. And so I think just turnover and complexity just compounding each other. One of those things you can go through. But when you're short staffed with new staff with complex transactions and then people aren't communicating throughout the district, you can see how something might slip through.

start time: 633:53:00.000
end time: 637:18:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I think the good news is that it's been. Management concurs. The district concurs that things have already been corrected. There was no, you know, serious impacts.

start time: 637:30:20.000
end time: 638:15:48.000
confidence: 0.89
C: Yeah. So and I overall, and I'll stress.

start time: 638:16:04.000
end time: 638:43:48.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Is that in the end, at the end of the day.

start time: 638:44:44.000
end time: 647:06:36.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Yeah. The accounting department to get through i4 major single audit programs for a single audit. That's a lot. And so in essence we did a lot of testing and to only find two with everything that's been going on can be counted as a win as well. And that the fact that found it, corrected it. So the financial statements are Fairly stated. So fantastic.

start time: 647:09:48.000
end time: 650:45:10.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I appreciate your presentation and also just want to appreciate the finance staff who are they've. They've gotten through this stress testing it sounds like. Does anybody have any other questions?

start time: 651:52:10.000
end time: 654:17:54.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I have one. I just have the letter that sort of summarizes again. I'll just.

start time: 654:19:22.000
end time: 654:49:54.000
confidence: 0.94
A: It's the letter dated today.

start time: 654:51:22.000
end time: 654:57:22.000
confidence: 0.63
C: Yeah.

start time: 654:58:26.000
end time: 655:09:22.000
confidence: 0.66
A: Okay.

start time: 655:11:46.000
end time: 730:57:36.000
confidence: 0.96
C: I'll just skim through this really fast. Please stop me if you have any questions. This is our letter. By auditing standards, we have to inform those in charge of governance, which is you and the board of Education, you as the audit committee and the Board of Education of certain things. Talks about our responsibilities. Talks about other communications that we've made. So we've signed arrangement letters. We sent a beginning communication. We talk about that. The district implemented GASB statement 96. We didn't identify other than already been noted significant or unusual transactions recorded after corrections. It goes into what we believe are some significant accounting estimates. Accounting estimates involve management decisions. They have to use their judgment to make these. So those charged with governance as part of a responsibility, we encourage them to review those estimates to make sure that they don't indicate any management bias. Because estimates are judgment. So they create a little bit more risk. So we want you to say hey, this isn't just you got it all or recorded a dollar. There's something more there. So investments. Investments are recorded at fair value. Once again the district has the people at BNY Mellon help value those investments for you guys. But still just make sure that hey, does it seem correct? Depreciation. So that's based on estimated useful lives. So is the district expecting a vehicle to last 100 years? That doesn't seem right. And so just those kinds of things. Self insurance claims. So these are incurred but not reported. So you don't really know what's out there. So you have to guess. And then of course there's pensions and opeb, which is pers. And. And all those future payments that you don't know yet but you use. The district uses actuaries or PERS uses actuaries to determine the PERS numbers anyways. Their best guess because we know the number is not zero. So they have to estimate that. And then also the subscriptions themselves. That liability is based on that estimate of incremental borrowing rate in the present. Estimating that present value. And the same thing with aces. Next once again goes over those audit adjustments laid out a little bit differently in a table format at each opinion unit. We're not aware of any uncorrected misstatements other than those that we would consider trivial. So you can imagine that there may be a dollar or two off, but we're. We're not going to trace down the penny. So there's that. We referenced the internal control brief and compliance findings that we already talked about. We're not aware of consultations with any other accountants that the district use. Next goes over future fund. So future GASB statements to be implemented. The list is getting shorter and shorter each year. So that is hopefully good news. There's sort of one out there. So GASB statement 100 accounting changes and error corrections. This is more of if something goes wrong, how to record it. There was the diversity in practice, as they call it. So different governments were doing different things and GASB came out and said, hey, we should all do it this way and use this terminology, have these disclosures. So hopefully the district ever really has to use those other than for implementing new. New accounting standards. And the next one is compensated absences. Once again, this is trying to modernize the. The rules around leave. So when the rules were first developed, you pretty much only had vacation time and sick time. Now you have sick time, vacation time, pto, unlimited leave, every variety.

start time: 730:59:28.000
end time: 731:20:00.000
confidence: 0.70
A: Dependent care.

start time: 731:22:00.000
end time: 732:54:24.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Yeah. And so. Yeah. Mental health days.

start time: 732:57:12.000
end time: 733:06:56.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Yes.

start time: 733:08:48.000
end time: 760:13:54.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Yes. So it goes over. If it falls in these buckets. This is how you record it. Now, once again, trying to get into. There's a lot of. Because there was no guidance for a lot of this stuff, you had a lot of variety out there, people recording in different ways. So once again trying to get everyone at least trying to get somewhat comparable information. Next is an important thing for us is the responsibility for independence. We like to remind people that we are independent auditors. While we work very closely with management, we work for the board. We are the board's auditors. So we work for you. We could not do our job without management, of course, and we appreciate all the assistance that they help us with trying to work through and gather all the documentation required to give our opinions. But at the end of the day, we can't make management decisions. So there's that. And basically it says we're going to try and maintain our independence and you're going to tell us if there's anything that might impair our independence. And then there's a copy of the management representation letter, which is a letter that we get at the end of every audit of. Here's all the stuff that we represent to you. I'll let you go through the laundry list there, but it's 86 items long. Yes.

start time: 760:16:02.000
end time: 760:27:50.000
confidence: 0.52
F: Wow.

start time: 760:50:50.000
end time: 764:12:30.000
confidence: 0.99
C: So we touch on pretty much every one of those points at some point during the audit. So this is once again the last chance for management to tell us, yes, this is what we're representing to you.

G: One very small thing, I think in the letter from the district, and I'm not sure if I saw it somewhere else. It notes that the governing body will plan of action will adopt it at January 9, 2023, and it'll be 2024. So I think we just got the year on just a typo.

F: So just on. On behalf of. Of the staff and. And our really invaluable consultants as well, Claire and Angie just wanted to. To share some appreciations and then talk a little bit about next steps just to kind of recap. So definitely want to thank the team in the CFO's department, financial services team, the accounting and general ledger teams in particular, for really going year round, but especially during audit season, taking care of these 86 items that are included and described in this management letter. Thank you, Director Scott, for that typo. That's a helpful typo for us to clean up. We'll resubmit that. But it's obviously a very complicated undertaking to carry this work out and there have been, as mentioned, a number of transitions. There's still some transitions that are ongoing. So definitely want to thank the team for their daily efforts to carry out these important responsibilities. Definitely want to thank Mr. Miley Dan and his colleague, Nathan Scarpole.

F: Well, I saw my share, but our colleagues saw them much more than I did for the last few months. So thank you both and others on the TKW team for working with us again this year. Thank you, Claire and Angie, again, they were both incredible, incredibly helpful in supporting our. Our team during some of our. Our shortage areas in terms of staff. And Tracy Pender is not here, but definitely want to. She. She couldn't be here today. She really wanted to be here and obviously has been playing an instrumental role in leading the effort on the part of the team. So I also want to thank the members of this committee, committee for your patience and understanding and flexibility under unusual circumstances with the timing of this report. And we stretched out our unusual timing till late this afternoon. So by way of, as a point of information, definitely needed that extra time and the delay to reschedule this meeting to till today and appreciate your flexibility in accommodating that and then Some of the news about the finding also came up fairly recently, which is the reason why we couldn't get the materials posted until this afternoon. So I appreciate your understanding of that. The next step in terms of the process is on January 9. All the materials in final form will be present, presented to the full board with them, accompanied by a vote to accept materials. And you'll see that some of the documents are in kind of different places for the purposes of this meeting. They will be harmonized and the right letters from TKW will be included in the right documents all together with. With PBS work product as well. So you'll see that in a, you know, hopefully more coherent fashion on December 9th. If anyone, present or otherwise, would like to follow up with staff in between now and January 9th, we would welcome that to. We know it's kind of. We didn't give you enough time to reasonably review these materials prior to this meeting. So if members of the committee here or, you know, folks that might be watching the recording later, care to follow up and ask clarifying questions or follow up in any way with staff, we welcome that between now.

A: That's great. I would personally love that. And I don't know, maybe we can buddy up. So you're not doing multiple meetings if there's a few of us or two.

start time: 848:17:16.000
end time: 850:44:16.000
confidence: 0.91
C: Or three of us. And just to echo one, I like this process started back in May. So, I mean, it's not something that happened.

start time: 850:44:48.000

end time: 859:34:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Yeah. And so of course the easy stuff gets knocked out. It's always the hard stuff that you're trying to wrap up and figure out at the last minute. So. So we appreciate definitely everybody keeping with us and, and answering the questions is like, wait, are you sure? What are you doing? The famous question of the auditor always starts with just one more thing. I've pulled staff to just stop saying.

confidence: 0.95
A: That piece of it about January. I mean, December 15th or so. Or I appreciate. I know that we moved the meeting back to accommodate some of this work and appreciate the reporting out. Also hearing that there's really nothing to worry about and that we'll get a More cohesive report January 9th if there aren't any other questions. I have a question. I'm just going to repeat the question.

start time: 866:42:24.000
end time: 868:47:40.000
confidence: 0.97
B: That you asked me earlier about whether or not having a material weakness affects our bond rating.

end time: 869:13:00.000
confidence: 0.87
A: Yes. Yes.

start time: 869:46:40.000
end time: 870:27:04.000
confidence: 1.00
C: I cannot speak directly to that.

start time: 870:28:32.000
end time: 870:38:32.000
confidence: 0.61
A: Maybe.

start time: 870:40:56.000
end time: 870:53:00.000
confidence: 0.72
E: Yeah.

start time: 871:40:10.000
end time: 907:32:40.000
confidence: 0.95
F: Well, this is just in real time here. I would expect and hope that it would not. That that would not be considered by any of the credit rating agencies as a significant factor in determining the district's credit worthiness. To that extent. That's a big decision on the part of a rating agency. And in my experience, this wouldn't map by itself to a reconsideration of the district's credit. I'm also would invite Claire, Angie, if they, if they have additional thoughts or different thoughts to weigh in. I would concur that I wouldn't anticipate something of this magnitude to have an impact on our bond rating. And if I can also just say as an editorial comment maybe, or maybe just an observation, I know PBS has been very, has worked really hard to avoid any findings whatsoever over the last several years and that that's to the district's credit. Different use of the word credit here. But the district should be proud of that, right? PBS should be proud of that. I will say I have seen, you know, especially in the district where I spent many years, that was true many years and some years it wasn't where there was one or where there were one or more findings in the annual, annual audit process. And similar to what we discussed here today, there's a clear articulation of the issue that was spotted. District concurs or partially concurs or disagrees and states their corrective action that's filed by the state regulators, overseers, et cetera. So long story short, I don't see this as a particularly unusual event. Certainly we want to get back to zero findings as quickly as possible and forever.

start time: 908:17:00.000
end time: 923:10:00.000
confidence: 0.97
G: Can I just add one thing? Yeah, I can cry. I would be very surprised in my experience to see this type of thing impact the bond rating. What I would say though is some of the underlying conditions that led to the material weakness around staff turnover, being short staffed, having lots of vacancies. Those are the kind of things that bond agencies look at when they're looking at an organization's creditworthiness. So I would just encourage the board to keep those things in mind as we go into what is going to be a challenging season of potential reductions that, you know, we hear a lot about needing to cut administration. And I'll just point out it is administration that does this and either does it right or does it wrong. And so that's for me, going to be something that I really want to focus on, making sure we as a board are correcting some of those underlying issues that might have led to the material weakness because I think those could have a longer lasting impact.

start time: 923:24:20.000
end time: 923:35:24.000
confidence: 0.99
C: Thank you.

start time: 923:36:52.000
end time: 924:46:52.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Yes, thank you for that. I have one more question. Sorry, just one more Question just to.

start time: 924:47:16.000
end time: 930:47:30.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Clarify one more question. Last thing on the schedule of question costs at the very bottom it says we're currently identified as a low risk entity. Does having this finding, it's not a single audit finding. So I wasn't, I'm not totally sure. Does that mean we're no longer considered low risk?

start time: 930:53:50.000
end time: 932:47:50.000
confidence: 0.91
C: Short answer is you will be considered a high risk oddity for the next two years. That's what I thought.

start time: 932:48:30.000
end time: 933:03:30.000
confidence: 0.65
A: Not three.

start time: 933:21:40.000
end time: 974:20:10.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So you have to have two years and pretty much two clean years of no material weaknesses. Not that it's okay. But if you have a significant deficiency, it's not considered a high risk oddity. It's that material weakness that, that pushes you up to the high risk oddity. There's other things that can impact of course that lower high risk oddity thing. But we anticipate this gets handled. We do two years. The underlying direct impact. I guess what I'm trying to say is it just increases our coverage and historically get how much. But we cleared the high risk oddity threshold just with the requirements that are just with the major programs that we were required based on the rules that were given. So, so a low risk auditing, it's required to get 20% of your federal awards audited. High risk, it's 40%. Well you have some large federal programs there that they have to be audited every three years. So you audit them, they're if there's no findings, they're low risk for two years. Then they become high risk again. Those major, those we call type A program. So that's above that threshold. So another line in that schedule findings and question costs is what we consider that high or that type a threshold. So 3 million. 3 million. And that's because you're over 100 million if you drop below that last year it was two point something because you were at that 90. So it, it can float around but in essence it's probably going to stay. And unless you have a significant change in that 2 to 3 ish million that anything above that gets categorized as a type A, which means it has to be audited at a minimum every two years. And there's some other things once again that can like the Education Stabilization Fund. The reason why that's considered a high risk type A is isn't because you had any findings. It's because the federal government decided it's high risk. So the federal government at the end of it you can go through all your procedures. The federal government can also go and say this program, we don't Care what you do. We can if it's above your type A threshold. We want it audited because we consider it high risk, just by its very nature.

start time: 975:24:30.000
end time: 976:16:22.000
confidence: 0.97
D: So high risk pretty much means you get a little more audit.

start time: 976:18:46.000
end time: 978:19:02.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. In the auditing world, higher risk, more work.

It's the contracts on it, status of implementation, and also posted in Word book. And for those of us that are here in the room, we've got hard copies if anybody would like to look at hard copies. I had a hard time reading the board book. It's really tiny. So, yeah, we're. This isn't the entire. Every single item. It's. We. We pulled items that we wanted to follow up on or. Or share, I would say, share updates on. Did you want to see if. You're welcome. Oh, yes. Sorry. This might be really exciting for you or it might be really boring, but it's this close to the holiday. I'm sure you've got this.

A: Can you just set a little history?

start time: 1005:39:50.000
end time: 1018:28:28.000
confidence: 0.98
B: So we issue the contracts audit in 2020. In June of 2020, and there were like 20 recommendations, and the district has been working to implement those recommendations. So the complete list of all the recommendations is posted in the board books. What I did for a printed copy to make the view a little bit bigger so we could actually see it, is I printed just the ones that are outstanding, the ones I have not been able to confirm implementation of. When you look in board books, all the ones that are grayed out that say confirmed are implemented. And we don't need to keep talking about them.

start time: 1018:30:44.000
end time: 1019:01:48.000
confidence: 0.89
A: It's the completed.

start time: 1019:04:44.000
end time: 1019:34:40.000
confidence: 0.98
B: The ones that I confirmed.

start time: 1019:56:20.000
end time: 1020:05:48.000
confidence: 0.86
H: Yeah.

start time: 1020:07:24.000
end time: 1020:27:40.000

A: Oh, I see. Yes. Thank you.

start time: 1020:28:20.000
end time: 1025:02:48.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So on the printed one that has a little bit bigger font, the only ones that are outstanding are listed here. So. So there we go. Do you want me to kind of go through the key ones?

start time: 1025:04:24.000
end time: 1027:32:56.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Yeah, the key ones would be great. And I mean, I think the ones that we talked about number 3.3C. Okay, I'll.

start time: 1027:33:28.000
end time: 1029:34:54.000
confidence: 0.86
B: I'll just read 4.4B, Dr. Evans, or do you want to read it?

start time: 1029:36:22.000
end time: 1030:38:06.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Well, I wasn't going to read to people, but I can talk about what each one is about.

start time: 1030:39:18.000
end time: 1031:03:30.000

confidence: 0.97
E: Good evening, everyone. Good to see you and to be with you in space again, just to recap, these contracts that the contracts were audited were personnel services contracts that, that impact and have direct contact with students. The majority of those contracts are racial equity and social justice partnership contracts. And I inherited leadership of that department as of August 1st. So Janice has been quickly onboarding me to what's been going on with the audit and what needs to happen. So starting with, I'll go through what was highlighted for me this afternoon. Starting with number three. This was a recommendation that we perform contract performance evaluations prior to deciding whether or not we would again work with a contractor. So I wanted to talk about what we are putting into place. Luckily, I also have the research and evaluation team as a part of my team.

start time: 1049:25:16.000
end time: 1049:33:24.000
confidence: 0.56
A: Excellent.

start time: 1049:34:12.000
end time: 1067:48:42.000
confidence: 0.96
E: And they are working on impact analyses by partner. So that would mean by contract. Yes, to understand the impact of the provided services on things like student attendance, student achievement as measured by a couple of different things. Gpa, student discipline. So we're trying to. We're trying to see if there are any impacts there. In addition to that, because our partners are working in schools we are working on. It's going to be really neat. It's going to be like a Yelp review site that we're going to have internally for our partners where the principals will give a review of the services that they provided and that will inform our renegotiation and our next talks with our partners. You may remember that our current racial equity and social justice contracts came out of an RFP that was released back in 2020. So we've had a three. It was a three year RFP. So it's time for us to renew the RFP, come in the new year for the next three years.

start time: 1067:50:26.000
end time: 1067:59:38.000
confidence: 0.66
A: Okay.

start time: 1068:01:14.000
end time: 1070:42:02.000
confidence: 1.00
E: So all of this type of information will go into our process of evaluation before we award any contracts moving forward for the next three years.

start time: 1070:45:06.000
end time: 1074:19:34.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Wow, that's. That's really big. So, okay, you talked about, you know, attendance, so that would be one of the measures. And then are we looking at academic performances?

start time: 1074:20:22.000
end time: 1074:59:02.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Yeah, we're looking at student achievements and gpa.

start time: 1075:00:06.000
end time: 1076:49:26.000
confidence: 0.97
A: And gpa. Student achievement gpa. Is that this like growth versus proficiency? Are we going to look at.

start time: 1076:50:38.000
end time: 1079:58:20.000
confidence: 0.93
E: We're going to look at both because. Because we can look at both, we can look at achievement and then we look at proficiency on statewide tests. And we can also look at growth on the MAP assessment as well.

start time: 1080:06:00.000
end time: 1080:51:40.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Okay. And then I don't want to.

start time: 1081:16:40.000
end time: 1082:28:00.000
confidence: 0.97
E: As long as the students are in grades three through eight.

start time: 1082:28:40.000
end time: 1082:32:00.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Right.

start time: 1082:32:40.000
end time: 1092:27:08.000
confidence: 0.96
E: At the high school we have to look at like GPA and other things. But at the elementary, middle levels, we can look at MAP in two different ways and then also look at state assessment results. The way we're able to do this per student, what we do is we look at each partner and the students they provided services to. So partners give us a list of students with their IDs, whom they're serving and then we can load that into our data systems and match it with all the student level data in order to run the analyses ourselves.

start time: 1092:30:04.000
end time: 1092:40:44.000
confidence: 0.75
A: Fantastic.

start time: 1092:41:32.000
end time: 1095:15:50.000
confidence: 0.93
E: So we're working on that. Those should be. And just for those of you who are very date oriented, we expect the impact analyses to be completely complete by February.

start time: 1095:18:30.000
end time: 1095:30:14.000
confidence: 0.45
A: Okay.

start time: 1095:32:22.000
end time: 1097:14:14.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I actually just this afternoon, but I haven't had time to look at it for last school year. Yes.

start time: 1097:15:02.000
end time: 1097:40:38.000
confidence: 0.85
A: Yeah, it's a look back.

start time: 1097:41:34.000
end time: 1105:36:50.000
confidence: 0.96
E: It's a look back. But we'll have those done by February. I just this afternoon got an example of one that I need to look at to provide feedback to my team moment. So I'm excited about that. We'll have the, the review platform or tool will be built by the time, by basically the first week of the new year. And then we're going to send it out to principals and hope to have that information back by March.

start time: 1105:45:50.000
end time: 1108:25:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Wow. So the input into an evaluation will be through principals, through this other data at the student level and then the.

start time: 1108:25:50.000
end time: 1112:25:10.000
confidence: 0.97
E: Rating that you give people who respond to your request for proposal. There's like an evaluation process that you give to each partner or company that says, hey, I want to provide services. So there's sort of an evaluation rubric that we'll have to, we'll have to design.

start time: 1112:27:10.000
end time: 1112:35:18.000
confidence: 0.86
A: Yes.

start time: 1112:36:54.000
end time: 1115:07:02.000
confidence: 0.97
E: And so all of that will go into whether or not we work with partner specific partners moving forward.

start time: 1115:08:46.000
end time: 1119:26:02.000
confidence: 0.91
A: And if there's a partner maybe that we've been working with, is there way, is there a way to offer them to improve or. Sure, I guess if you have the, the rubric that every, everybody knows what, what the expectation is and what the performance.

start time: 1119:27:46.000
end time: 1133:50:16.000
confidence: 0.97
E: So this isn't in our internal analyses, our impact analyses aren't, they aren't designed to be gotchas. What we, what we do is we have quarterly meetings with our partners. We haven't had that yet this year because of the work stoppage, to be honest, we just able to. And the timing wasn't right because we were going to have that in November and then we weren't in school. What we're planning to do. One of the ideas for our initial meeting with them, which I believe will be in early February, we'll talk about a lot of things, but one of the things we're going to do is share partners impact analyses with them if their data were clean enough for us to do an analysis and if their data weren't in a way that we could do analysis, to sit down and provide them support so that when they provide their data throughout this year, we hope to be able to do analyses on this year's data moving forward for them.

B: What I think she's referring to is, you know, when you post the contract, then the review and evaluation would for that contract, previous contract, she's wondering if that will be. If that can be posted.

A: You want that Yelp page? I think that's. It's. I'm really happy to hear about this because this is something that's. I've. I've been curious about the, you know, what are we measuring and are we measuring impact? Not to put a dollar figure on everything, but for every dollar that we spend, you know, what the. What. What is that? What is the impact of each dollar that we spend in certain communities? Sure. And we want it to be, you know, something that's substantive and moves the dial, especially for our kids that aren't, you know, meeting the standards.

confidence: 0.94
E: Mark next to that in progress. We're working on it. You know, Janice will soon be able to confirm it. 3C is asking us, recommending that we require the review and evaluation to be reviewed and approved by the contract manager supervisor. That would be me. And submitted to the Purchasing and Contracting department for record keeping. And if we complete. When we complete that evaluation form, we'll be able to submit all of that to the purchasing and contract office. So that's something that we can do. Absolutely.

end time: 1179:51:36.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Yeah, we'll have that. I want to give us till July 1st to do that because I'm thinking that that that's a safe date because the new contracts will probably come to the board in June.

E: Once we go through the whole RFP process. So if we have it to you in June, then I know we can have it to Purchasing and contracting by July or around the same time frame. But I just wanted to be realistic with the upcoming RFP and the request for new services and what that might look like.

E: This was 3C. Certain ones were highlighted for me, the key ones to talk about. So we're not going. We're not going in all the order of all the ones that aren't grayed out, but highlighting some ones that this committee said were important to them, the most important for.

A: Okay.

end time: 1252:29:10.000
confidence: 0.96
D: So I have a question for Dr. Adams about the different restorative justice groups. So I know there's a lot that we're working with, but is there competition? Like, are there two groups who are helping Latinos that one would.

start time: 1252:43:30.000
end time: 1269:45:42.000
confidence: 0.96
E: That's a great question. The way I would answer it is I would say we have more culturally specific racial equity and social justice partners who are African American than any other group. But we also have lots of need. Right. And so partners don't necessarily have to compete over the same sets of students, because, of course, we have black and brown students in all of our schools. So what we do have is a finite pot of resources for which to contract with our partners. So that usually limits what we're Trying to work on. We also have different strategies. And I can share a document with this committee if it's helpful, that the racial equity and social justice partners work on. And they can choose to work on particular strategies. There are five of them. They can choose to work on one or two, and they can work on one in A, middle school and two in B, middle school, and one and two in middle school C. So that.

start time: 1269:46:06.000
end time: 1271:17:52.000
confidence: 0.98
D: Will be really good to get some more information about how it's working.

start time: 1272:53:40.000
end time: 1274:42:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: What are you asking, though, about the competitive nature of contracting? That's what I'm curious about that, too.

start time: 1275:13:40.000
end time: 1277:27:40.000
confidence: 0.99
B: I think what we did was the RFP and we sent it out, and anybody who wanted to participate submitted applications.

start time: 1277:30:20.000
end time: 1277:41:48.000
confidence: 0.78
A: Okay.

start time: 1277:43:24.000
end time: 1287:22:12.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And then there's some grading. So it's similar. It's a competitive process from that perspective that we send post the rfp. And everybody who wants to participate in providing the services that is included in the RFP submits like a proposal. So in that way, it is competitive because then they use the rubric to score them and then pick the. So it is competitive from that perspective in the rfp.

start time: 1287:23:16.000
end time: 1288:11:48.000
confidence: 0.96
D: Okay. So the next step is, how's the job being done?

start time: 1288:14:04.000
end time: 1288:26:00.000
confidence: 0.65
I: Yes.

start time: 1288:41:00.000

start time: 1289:41:00.000
end time: 1290:57:24.000
confidence: 0.96
E: The next two we'll talk about because one is nested as four.

end time: 1291:50:40.000

H: I actually had a question for number three.

start time: 1292:03:40.000
end time: 1292:16:00.000
confidence: 0.85
A: Sure.

start time: 1292:27:40.000
end time: 1307:19:22.000
confidence: 0.94
H: It was. I'm looking through the scope of work for. And this seems to be constant across everything I've looked through. I've looked through Open School Latino Network. It calls for us to do measure or grading on each contractor on four different points. And when I'm looking through Open School, it has a section on page six for analyze the following measures regarding partner performance and impact on students. Attendance, GPA achievement, sense of belonging, referrals, and discipline. And it's just a blank box. So it seems like they're getting put in these documents, but not actually being filled out across everyone that I've seen for the scope of.

start time: 1307:21:06.000
end time: 1309:01:00.000
confidence: 0.99
E: Sure. So what I can share is that when I inherited this department in August, the contracts were in process.

start time: 1309:03:00.000
end time: 1309:12:28.000
confidence: 0.65
C: Yeah.

start time: 1309:14:04.000
end time: 1310:50:20.000
confidence: 0.95
E: So what I'm committing to you is making things more prescribed and discreet moving forward. Because I can't change what happened before.

start time: 1310:51:00.000
end time: 1311:09:20.000
confidence: 0.89
C: I was in charge.

start time: 1311:55:00.000
end time: 1312:32:28.000
confidence: 0.94
A: So in other words, that that would be.

start time: 1312:34:44.000
end time: 1313:23:40.000
confidence: 0.96
E: We'll still have those measures in because we're looking at those.

start time: 1313:24:20.000
end time: 1313:27:40.000
confidence: 0.98
C: Right.

start time: 1313:28:20.000
end time: 1320:55:40.000
confidence: 0.97
E: There was also my understanding in the past, perhaps the partners analyzed the data and gave that to us, which didn't make sense to me because I'm like, we have the data, so we just need to know which students you served. And we have an independent group. That's all they do is analyze data and we can have them do that for us. So I think that gives us a clear picture. Unless I'm misunderstanding because I don't have my device with me now that you.

start time: 1320:56:20.000
end time: 1324:47:10.000
confidence: 0.96
B: Mentioned it now I think I might perhaps understand. So it's blank on the side where the. For the contractor. Because they're not going to send us anything. We're going to internally.

start time: 1325:02:10.000
end time: 1325:16:30.000
confidence: 0.62
A: Okay.

start time: 1325:34:10.000
end time: 1326:09:30.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Evaluate based off those bullet points.

start time: 1326:10:10.000
end time: 1326:15:22.000
confidence: 0.56
E: Yes.

start time: 1326:16:26.000
end time: 1327:36:58.000
confidence: 0.89
B: And the contractor's not going to provide anything to us. We're doing it ourselves.

start time: 1327:38:34.000
end time: 1327:43:54.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Yes.

start time: 1327:44:42.000
end time: 1327:56:10.000

B: Okay.

start time: 1327:58:50.000
end time: 1328:53:50.000
confidence: 0.96
H: So these documents are being provided by the contractor.

start time: 1329:18:10.000
end time: 1336:30:34.000
confidence: 0.96
E: What they give us are the students that they serve and the student's id and we match that up and then we can match it to students achievement data, their discipline data, their attendance, et cetera, and then we can run analyses to understand. And those aren't done by the racial equity and social justice team. Those are done by the research and evaluation team. So it's a different team who. That's their area of expertise that does that work.

start time: 1336:32:02.000
end time: 1337:22:02.000
confidence: 0.94
A: And it's somewhat independent too, then, I mean.

start time: 1337:25:06.000
end time: 1338:08:32.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Right. Because they have nothing to do with the partnerships.

A: Yeah, yeah.

end time: 1354:08:10.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Yeah. So the scope of work. So I'm looking at. I went back a little bit on board book to the Aug. 28 meeting, going over some of the contracts that we had and the scope of work documents. Are those. Because I'm looking on page six, contract performance measures. Is that just data handed to us by the contractors or is that.

end time: 1358:12:10.000
confidence: 0.95
E: Yeah. I just don't have my device, so I can't track it with you. Number of students served, they give us that.

start time: 1358:26:30.000
end time: 1359:58:08.000

end time: 1365:14:04.000
confidence: 0.92

start time: 1365:15:32.000
end time: 1372:59:10.000
confidence: 0.98
E: Because then what we can do is we can do analyses that say. Or we can ask the question, is there a relationship between the number of hours you are provided as a student and your attendance per se? If you're working on a mentoring strategy, like maybe the connection with the mentor is then being realized through your having a stronger connection to school and coming to school a little bit more frequently than you otherwise would have. So we can ask those types of questions.

start time: 1373:12:50.000
end time: 1373:48:58.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Those are those pivot tables.

start time: 1373:51:54.000
end time: 1388:00:00.000
confidence: 0.97
E: It could be a pivot table, yes. So if we look at. Thank you, Myung, for that. If we look at number 4 and 4B, 4 talks about really the specialized scope of work and having specific performance measures and expected outcomes. And what I can say is the contracts that came forward in August are using the specialized scope of work format. And I know we need to clean up and get more specific with types of performance measures. Again, that was in process when I took over in leadership. So that will be in place moving forward with new contracts which will come to the board in June for July 1, August, whatever the first day of school is, start date. So that'll be in place by July 1st.

end time: 1398:35:10.000
confidence: 0.97
A: Number nine.

start time: 1398:48:10.000
end time: 1399:13:22.000
confidence: 0.72
E: Number is number nine.

start time: 1399:15:06.000
end time: 1399:57:22.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Let's see number nine.

start time: 1400:00:26.000
end time: 1401:17:22.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Number and 17 and 18. Those kind of go together.

start time: 1401:19:06.000
end time: 1402:45:50.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Yeah, they do. Let's see for eight. Why did I have eight there?

start time: 1403:24:10.000
end time: 1404:01:10.000
confidence: 0.91
D: Oh, that's reviewing contracts.

start time: 1404:57:30.000
end time: 1406:06:42.000
confidence: 0.98
A: We can go looking at the time. We can go through at 9.

start time: 1406:08:26.000
end time: 1406:20:10.000
confidence: 0.76
B: Skip 8.

start time: 1406:21:30.000
end time: 1407:23:06.000
confidence: 0.91
A: We skip 8, we can go to 9 and then 17 and 18.

start time: 1407:24:18.000
end time: 1407:29:46.000
confidence: 0.92
E: Sure.

start time: 1407:30:58.000
end time: 1407:55:06.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Because they are related.

start time: 1407:57:38.000
end time: 1410:55:50.000
confidence: 0.99
E: So 9 is about making sure that contract management responsibilities are being performed. I see that as a part of my supervision of my team and my staff.

start time: 1411:00:50.000
end time: 1411:39:22.000
confidence: 0.78
A: So that we.

start time: 1411:39:46.000
end time: 1412:51:54.000
confidence: 0.90
E: You do as well. Right. I'm glad we're on the same pace. I'm so excited.

start time: 1412:52:42.000
end time: 1413:06:30.000
confidence: 1.00
C: We agree.

start time: 1413:31:40.000
end time: 1428:20:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: And so this is in place now. Right. I have with my contract managers, I have either weekly or bi weekly check ins where we're talking about lots of different things, including contract management responsibilities. Because I understand that that's an area that was a concern and an area that came up in the audit is one that we should address. So this is in place. Also. I have not had. The office has not had a person in charge of the racial equity and social justice partnerships for two years. There's been a challenge with hiring and I think there may have been not budget for it. I don't know. I don't have that history. But what I can tell you right now is I have budget for it. I have a position posted, I have interested applicants and we're looking at. I'm hoping to get somebody in the seat in the next 60 days.

start time: 1428:22:40.000
end time: 1430:25:42.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Wow. You're already ahead of it. That's fantastic. I mean, just to have somebody, a personnel, a person assigned to.

A: Caring about this.

start time: 1431:01:18.000
end time: 1434:19:18.000
confidence: 0.96
E: It was falling on another staff member's work responsibilities on top of their already full time job and along with another work responsibility as well. So I'm trying to clean all that up.

start time: 1434:20:14.000
end time: 1434:39:18.000
confidence: 0.78
A: Trying to like isolate.

start time: 1434:40:54.000
end time: 1436:19:04.000
confidence: 0.98
E: Yeah, exactly. I need you to please have this. This is your full plate and you don't need a second full plate.

start time: 1436:19:52.000
end time: 1436:25:12.000
confidence: 0.53
A: Yes.

start time: 1436:26:16.000
end time: 1437:01:12.000
confidence: 0.99
E: You can come for seconds, but you can't have two plates.

start time: 1437:02:16.000
end time: 1437:07:52.000
confidence: 0.65
A: Yes.

start time: 1437:08:56.000
end time: 1438:06:32.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Right. At the same time. Right. One plate at a time.

start time: 1438:09:36.000
end time: 1438:30:48.000
confidence: 0.99
A: This is not Thanksgiving.

start time: 1438:32:24.000
end time: 1442:19:52.000
confidence: 0.96
E: This is not Thanksgiving and we don't want people overloading. You know, I believe in, you know, I believe in work life balance and it's a good balance if you're trying to do two and a half jobs at once. So we want to stop that.

start time: 1442:21:36.000
end time: 1443:04:08.000
confidence: 0.99
H: Don't want to make it feel like after Thanksgiving where you eat too much.

start time: 1443:05:04.000
end time: 1443:37:28.000
confidence: 0.84
E: And then you can't move and you're.

start time: 1443:37:44.000
end time: 1444:09:50.000
confidence: 0.92
H: In pain because you ate way too much.

start time: 1444:25:30.000
end time: 1444:48:30.000
confidence: 0.90
D: Can't do the job.

start time: 1444:56:10.000
end time: 1445:12:30.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Thank you.

start time: 1445:20:10.000
end time: 1451:13:46.000
confidence: 0.94
E: 17. What I can say here is the position description that I have. The job posting position description for the staff member that will have this responsibilities includes language around contract management very explicitly. It is in fact the second bullet on the list of things you're responsible for.

start time: 1451:14:58.000
end time: 1451:32:26.000
confidence: 1.00
A: That's fantastic.

start time: 1451:34:18.000
end time: 1452:15:38.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I saw it today. I'm so excited.

start time: 1452:17:14.000
end time: 1452:30:18.000
confidence: 0.97
E: And I have it here.

start time: 1452:31:14.000
end time: 1452:43:50.000
confidence: 0.89
B: The best.

start time: 1452:58:10.000
end time: 1454:48:26.000
confidence: 0.90
A: Wow. That is a great job for that for the right person. Yeah.

start time: 1454:48:58.000
end time: 1455:33:50.000
confidence: 1.00
E: I'm excited about finding a good fit.

start time: 1456:00:50.000
end time: 1456:30:22.000
confidence: 0.99
A: And then finally. 18.

start time: 1456:32:49.000
end time: 1466:25:58.000
confidence: 0.97
E: 18. This was about workload, you know, part of. Yeah. So this is going to be addressed through our hiring process where then I won't have a staff member trying to juggle all of these contracts and partnership responsibilities on top of their other regularly Scheduled full load of responsibilities. So, again, I'm hoping that this is resolved in the next 60 days. I mean, in terms of having someone here, we know it takes time to onboard staff and get them up to speed, but, you know, four hands are better than two when it comes to this work.

start time: 1466:26:54.000
end time: 1474:27:34.000
confidence: 0.97
A: So I guess I'm really excited about because where the work lives and trying to align where the work lives with the needs that we have and the students that have high needs. So it seems like a good alignment of focusing on this body of work and aligning that work with the kids that need the most help in our system. So I'm really excited about it.

start time: 1474:30:22.000
end time: 1477:13:30.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Thank you. I've never heard of someone in an audit committee say they're excited, but I'll take it. I'm going to take it. I'm going to take it and run with that all the way through the holiday.

start time: 1477:27:10.000
end time: 1479:14:10.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Nobody said this committee was. I did. Nobody said this committee wasn't fun.

start time: 1479:21:50.000
end time: 1480:14:46.000
confidence: 0.92
E: No, it's just my first time. I like to experience it for myself.

E: Sure.

start time: 1483:23:12.000

end time: 1487:05:28.000
confidence: 0.95
A: And then also. Are you going to be graying? I will these out or do you need to have a person in the seat for you?

start time: 1487:07:44.000
end time: 1487:21:28.000
confidence: 0.83
B: I will gray.

confidence: 0.96
E: Sure. It's an. It's important work. We. We know our students need support. We want to fund that support and we want to make sure that everything we're funding that we have some kind of return on investment. So I'm a believer in all of those things. So I appreciate the committee's attention to this and we'll work to improve things where I can.

confidence: 0.95
A: Thank you. Okay, we've got two more items. And looking at the time, it's about 25 till. We've got two more items. We've got an update to the edits of the board policy. And you've got a redlined board policy in board book. And we talked about this very briefly at one of our last board meetings.

start time: 1520:23:00.000
end time: 1522:17:00.000
confidence: 0.97
B: No, it was at the last audit committee meeting. We were wanting to bring on another community member.

start time: 1522:19:00.000
end time: 1522:26:20.000
confidence: 0.77
A: Yes.

start time: 1522:27:40.000
end time: 1524:03:56.000
confidence: 0.96
B: But we didn't actually have a policy that allowed for it. So this policy.

start time: 1524:06:28.000
end time: 1524:50:52.000
confidence: 0.96
A: So we did talk about. I mean, this was on the list.

start time: 1524:51:16.000
end time: 1525:04:44.000
confidence: 0.76
I: Of the policy committee.

start time: 1525:06:12.000
end time: 1525:10:36.000
confidence: 0.66
B: Yeah.

start time: 1525:11:08.000
end time: 1526:02:50.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Oh, so the policy committee. Not the full. Thank you. Not the full board.

start time: 1526:05:00.000
end time: 1526:50:50.000
confidence: 0.93
B: So this hasn't already gone to the policy.

start time: 1527:07:50.000
end time: 1527:22:06.000
confidence: 0.90
C: Yeah.

start time: 1527:25:18.000
end time: 1530:03:58.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yes, it has already gone to the policy committee. The policy committee referred it out of the committee to the full board for the first reading.

start time: 1530:05:34.000
end time: 1530:11:42.000
confidence: 0.89
A: Yes.

start time: 1530:12:46.000
end time: 1531:27:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: And it has been on. It has gone through the first reading.

start time: 1531:28:30.000
end time: 1531:45:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yes, it has.

start time: 1531:50:30.000
end time: 1532:18:38.000
confidence: 0.99
B: So this is.

start time: 1532:19:34.000
end time: 1532:40:46.000
confidence: 0.93
A: And I don't know that we've gotten any.

start time: 1532:41:58.000
end time: 1536:53:58.000
confidence: 0.96
B: For the audit committee. If you see anything, you know, speak now, because this is kind of. We're moving forward and getting it approved. But I did want to bring back the edits to the audit committee to make sure everybody had a chance to take a look.

start time: 1536:56:14.000
end time: 1542:24:30.000
confidence: 0.93
A: Yeah, I've already submitted my comments. And basically this was to. The language about having two committee members was originally in the poll in the district performance auditing policy somehow was removed inadvertently. It's now back in and we've got a second community member that's anxious to get started. So.

start time: 1542:26:30.000
end time: 1547:51:58.000
confidence: 0.91
I: And I also think, isn't there other board policy that says that you can have community members on our committees? There's a different policy. So I want to assure people that by having somebody, we weren't actually running afoul of the other policy. This just makes it really explicit that we have this.

start time: 1547:54:14.000
end time: 1555:08:40.000
confidence: 0.98
A: I thought that both were referenced, but I might be mistaken. The only other question or comment I had was whether we should require audit committee members that are community members to go through our ethics training, and perhaps the ethics training could be recorded. This was Janice's idea. Recorded. So all of our community volunteers.

start time: 1555:11:20.000
end time: 1555:54:16.000
confidence: 0.87
I: And it is recorded also.

start time: 1555:55:28.000
end time: 1556:28:36.000
confidence: 0.89
B: It's on YouTube. So we could.

start time: 1556:29:48.000
end time: 1556:54:44.000
confidence: 0.97
A: It is on YouTube. Okay.

start time: 1556:56:52.000
end time: 1557:14:28.000
confidence: 0.69
B: Because we'll just.

start time: 1557:15:24.000
end time: 1557:47:48.000
confidence: 0.94
A: But do we have a way to track if.

start time: 1557:50:04.000
end time: 1558:58:44.000
confidence: 0.92
B: Yes. So if we did put it into Pepper, then we could track who's taken it.

start time: 1559:00:12.000
end time: 1561:20:04.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Okay. Yes. So just in our ethics training that we went through a couple of weeks ago, I think you can figure out.

start time: 1561:20:12.000
end time: 1561:41:56.000
confidence: 0.87
I: How to get that into Pepper.

start time: 1561:43:48.000
end time: 1564:01:20.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Okay. Yeah, we talked about just that volunteers are public officials also.

start time: 1564:07:40.000
end time: 1564:14:28.000
confidence: 0.90
C: So.

start time: 1564:15:24.000
end time: 1564:49:24.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Okay. That was my only.

start time: 1564:50:52.000
end time: 1566:38:28.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Did you want that to be in as an edit to the plot? Do you want that in the policy or do you want.

start time: 1566:40:44.000
end time: 1570:00:00.000
confidence: 0.97
A: I mean, I think it's the other policy, Roseanne, that you just mentioned that it would be. It's a broader policy. I don't have the number in front of me. I guess I could look it up.

start time: 1570:14:20.000
end time: 1570:43:32.000
confidence: 0.97
I: I'm not sure what policy that is.

start time: 1570:43:56.000
end time: 1573:01:00.000
confidence: 0.94
A: I. But it should apply to all of our community members, not just the ethics training. Yes.

start time: 1573:30:40.000

H: And I said board meetings were fun before a board meeting started like a month and a half ago or something. And everybody. You guys were in another meeting and everybody in the room turned around, looks at me and just goes, you find this fun? The one thing I am curious about is I am not on the district student council. Right. So I'm not a student representative for the district, unlike Joe. So where do I fall in? Because that's a fall in after the discretionary discretion chair.

A: I think I might have shared that I met, that I meet board members from all over the country and some, some boards have two student representatives and of some of those boards they have voting. The student representative can vote on board activity. Okay, next one. So Detroit, I believe is one of those that has two student reps. There are a couple in California, there's one in Texas. I can get the list if you're interested. I'm going to take a little bit of fact finding, but yeah, so they're voting board members at the board level. The student representatives are voting and not in every district but in some districts. And there's a movement of students, by the way, that are working to make sure every single student has a vote.

confidence: 0.94
A: Okay. So. And it's, it's got the first reading and sounds like there's no comments on it. So we'll just let it go through the second. Let it go through.

B: The last thing on the agenda is you guys asked last meeting for a rough template of what we're going to do for future meetings. So I use this for myself. So I just am giving you what I already made, but I pop into this section things that I think are going to be needed in that meeting. So on the agenda, for example, in the February meeting we'll need to talk about the OIPA budget and in the May meeting we'll need to talk about our annual performance evaluation. So I popped those in to the meetings. But there can still be more things if anybody wants to add to it. We can discuss more. But I just try to drop in the priority things so you can know what to expect at future meetings.

start time: 1652:08:10.000

A: Well, I appreciate it. I find this helpful to refer back to. And we only have two more meetings this year, so we've got our next meeting is February 28th at 5. It looks like a really full agenda. And then our final meeting for the year will be May 15, 2024. With that, I'd really love to give everybody their 16 minutes back because it's the holidays and it's just the right thing to do anyway. Unless there are other questions.

I: I was just noticing that the other policy says that community members are non voting and this one says they're voting. So there is a conflict there.

start time: 1664:30:00.000
end time: 1667:53:44.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Okay. So there's a conflict between whether community members are voting or non voting. I think so. Can we have further discussion offline about that and figure out how to a path forward?

start time: 1667:56:32.000
end time: 1668:59:00.000
confidence: 0.93

start time: 1675:35:10.000
end time: 1678:23:30.000
confidence: 0.93
I: But that was one thing you referenced before about why we weren't concerned about having that committee member join is because there was another policy that over.

start time: 1678:32:30.000
end time: 1680:38:10.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Yes. Okay. So the question is whether or not audit committee members are voting members.

end time: 1683:32:20.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Sounds like it's in conflict with another policy. But let me probably need to reach out to legal.
