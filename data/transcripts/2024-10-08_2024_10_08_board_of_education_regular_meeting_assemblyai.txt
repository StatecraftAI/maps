A: This public regular meeting of the Board of education for October 8, 2024 is called to order. All items being considered this evening are posted on the PPS website under the Board and Meetings tab. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed throughout the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. All right. Good evening and welcome. Thank you all for being here this evening. Before we get started, I want to share a few housekeeping reminders. In order to ensure safety, please keep walkways and aisles clear. I don't think it will be a problem today. We will also ask you to please consider around those around you and keep signs below chin level. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that our primary objective is engage in the business and service of our children. We want everyone to be examples of being respectful and courteous to each other, including board members, even when we disagree. One thing I do want to remind as a quick reminder, one of the proposed changes, the proposed change for board meetings and attendance is that we are trying to remember the proposed changes. We are basically going to allow as many people to attend that can fill the main auditorium seats. And then to maximize the amount of seats that we have, we ask staff to sit in those wonderful green high quality desks in the back. But once the boardroom is filled, the doors will be closed. This is for safety reasons and occupancy reasons. However, the board meetings will be accessible through streaming on TV, YouTube and PPS TV. Alright, to start, let's start off with Superintendent Dr. Armstrong. Would you like to start off with your report?

D: Cue up my slides and jump right on to it. I am excited to report that we have just finished 30 days of school. And yes, I want to start the presentation off with an Update on the 100 Days of School plan. I am excited to highlight a few key actions and I want to also acknowledge the hard work of my team in the rear of the room. Expanded cabinet. Next slide. First, I want to tell you about the kickoff event that is happening for the community transition team is what it's called ctt. It's happening this Friday. There are three dates where I will join the community in discussion and reflection. October 11, November 15 and January 23. The next slide shows you some of the businesses and organizations who will be represented in the space. So we are super excited to invite partners into the space and hear about the work that will be happening over the next few months. Next slide. So thinking of those three priorities, I won't Restate them. There's just three different things I want to lift up. The first is that the science of reading remains a core piece of learning. And during the month of September, educators in the 20 schools that make up our first Science of Reading cohort completed the first asynchronous learning module on phonological awareness and then engaged in cross site Synchronous PD during our September early release. And so super excited that that ARC is continuing and literacy is something that we are leaning into. The second is I had the opportunity. I've been doing listening and learning sessions and so just a couple of days ago I was able to participate in an experience with the Portland association of Teachers and I was able to hear experiences directly from the core Enrichment teachers. As you all know, we made changes to our funding model and I am looking forward to hearing from my team the results of that work and just being able to pair that with the experiences that I'm hearing directly from teachers. And then lastly tonight, the board action on our collective work for our legislative agenda and then also continuing to make progress and looking forward towards eventually a bond resolution to improve our facilities and finish those last few high schools. Next slide. So it is National Principals Month. Super excited. We have 95 principals across programs. Principals, vice principals, assistant principals play a key role in the mission of Portland Public Schools and I am so proud of our extraordinary leaders. I just want to highlight three really quickly. The next slide we have David Holm, Portland Evening and Summer Scholars. You can read more about him. This PDF will be posted the next slide. Super excited about Cheryl James for Teen Parent Services, learning about her and her work. And then lastly I want to lift up Trevor Greer and Harriet Tubman and the work that he's doing at our middle school. I am so excited that you will be able oh yes. So I said 95 principals and I named three. We don't have time for me to go through the other 92, but what you can do is follow along on social media, Instagram, Facebook, x Twitter and our very own website where you can see the different leaders that will be featured throughout this month. And so again, just super excited. I'm also excited to acknowledge on the next slide that it is Dyslexia Awareness Month and we know that literacy is a civil right. And as you all know from my first goal, we are leaning into lifting literacy across our city. And I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Dyslexia Awareness Month and to know that the work that needs to happen happens in all spaces. So thank you and Lastly, I love that this goes without saying. Our very own Portland Public School schools graduate, who is now a teacher in our system who has been for a decade, is now Oregon State teacher of the Year. Brian Butcher, junior math teacher at Beaumont Middle School. We gotta applause again. Come on. There we go.

A: Good evening, Chair Hong, Vice chair depass, members of the school board and superintendent Armstrong. My name is Jorge Sanchez Bautista. J O R G E B A U T I S T A I am a student senior at McDaniel High School, formerly known as James Madison, as you all know, and a community organizer. I am here today to urge prioritizing school safety for PPS students. Over the years, schools such as McDaniel, Roosevelt, Jefferson, Cleveland and Franklin have been impacted by gun violence in the past decade. For an example, McDaniel Last year, students had a lockdown during passing period for almost about a half hour due to a potential threat. I don't quite remember if it was a bomb threat or a gun threat, but I do remember it was a type of threat. And afterwards we had learned that it was nothing serious. We were directed to just go back to class as if nothing had happened. And within an hour of the new period starting, we had over 300 students leave campus. Not as a protest, but just like, I don't want to be here after, you know, this had happened, you know, in Roosevelt may have in dismay, you know, shots were fired near Roosevelt high school in 2021. We had that big lockdown where like three schools were shut down for some time because of a student stealing another Student's weapon In Jefferson in 2022, students were shot by a drive by in Franklin in 2023 during a basketball game. There was a teenager that was injured there right next to the gym. My supervisor at my job had told me about this. There's some teenagers shooting. And then In Cleveland in 2022, a teenager was shot right outside the school, which caused lockdown. You know, most people like myself understand that this isn't just a local problem, but a national matter as we've seen so many school shootings and violence occur in schools. You know, this has become so common that when we see it on the news, we're not even shocked or surprised, but we're just like, okay, this is sad. You know, like, we need to do something about it. And like, you know, students like myself are always asking or teachers or families, like, are we next? Is this going to happen in our school or in our school district? And then, you know, the. That fear and thought that students have, like, where are the exits? Where do I go? Or what do I do in case this happens? Do I have to get a weapon? Do I stay in the corner like my teacher is instructing me to do? I help them out because the teachers are the ones that are going to have to sacrifice their lives for us. And that part we just can't accept that students and teachers shouldn't have to be the ones going to do that. And families having to think whether their kids are going to be coming back that day. You know, like back in the day, students and families felt comfortable with their kids going to school because that was the most protected part. But that isn't the part right now. I do want to respect each other's time, but, you know, just keep in mind that what we have mentioned is a priority not just for pps, but, you know, throughout the Portland community. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Go ahead.

start time: 251:25:42.000
end time: 260:28:54.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Do want to make a comment on when we're talking about that? I know there was a year before last that we actually did a safety task force and there was a few recommendations that came from our students. And so I'm hoping that we revisit that at some point to look at what those recommendations were. They had a very robust conversation with our students and our students gave them some real great feedback. So if we can come back around to some of those recommendations, that would be great.

start time: 260:31:42.000
end time: 268:33:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Thanks, some good ideas and thank you to our students for bringing that up. And also to remind everybody about that lockdown drills are, you know, we shouldn't be normalizing. They're really messed up. Right. I mean, we shouldn't be even having them. So thank you for bringing that up and, and bringing up ideas for how we can help make that better on the. The other end of it. So thank you.

start time: 271:59:30.000
end time: 272:18:30.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Is this available?

start time: 274:27:30.000

confidence: 0.96
G: And I'd also like to state that the list that he gave you is actually not even close to being what it actually is. He gave you a very brief listing. There were several that he's. That he could have went into and shared more about that were a lot closer to the schools than we like to pay homage to. And we generally brush it over because maybe it happened after school hours. And so we like to say that if it happened after school hours, was it technically a school event. But yet we also find out that they are. They are our students from different spaces. Regardless of whether it's after school hours, if it's coming back from a game or returning to a game, there's a lot more. There's a lot more involved here. And I do want to appreciate you for taking the time and doing the homework. And I know that there's a lot more that could have been shared and you probably held out a lot just out of respect of time. But I want to make sure that we go on record as stating that we know, even if he didn't say it, we know that there are a lot more shootings that are happening within a 1 mile radius of our schools than we like to talk about. And a mile is too close.

A: Yeah.

start time: 295:39:38.000

start time: 296:23:30.000
end time: 297:29:30.000
confidence: 0.99
D: Because I think it truly matters to students if we could connect with each other to meet more about this.

start time: 297:30:10.000
end time: 297:45:30.000
confidence: 0.96
G: That way I could get a better.

end time: 304:09:30.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Understanding seeing how we can actually make some of these changes. Thank you so much. Yes, thank you. All right, any other comments before moving on? All right, moving on. Our next item is to approve the Portland Public Schools advocacy agenda. Dr. Armstrong, would you like to introduce this item?

start time: 304:36:30.000
end time: 331:16:40.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yeah, absolutely. I appreciate that. Sorry, I'm getting caught up. Okay. So the 2025 legislative session will be extremely important this year, in part due to the approximate 4 million shortfall we are currently forecasting. Our team will spend their time both pushing for funding and that not only closes those gaps, but allows us to provide the high quality education that our students deserve. We'll be also advocating for long overdue changes to the funding formula for special education and pushing the legislator to fund the mandates they place on our districts. Given the sheer number of work groups and task force during the interim on topics such as Accountability, chronic absenteeism and school funding. We expect education to be a major focus this season. Given the events of last school year, PPS will be a critical voice during the upcoming session. We will weigh in on bills, provide verbal and written testimony, and meet regularly with lawmakers. We will also partner with PPS families and key community leaders to advocate for our shared priorities. We're meeting with parent advocates who are lobbying our elected officials and elevating education funding to our delegation. So walking us through the revised advocacy the agenda, based on feedback we heard from you at the last meeting, is Chief of Staff Deborah Kafouri.

F: Thank you, Superintendent. Good evening, Directors. I'm Deborah Caffori. I'm the chief of staff. And Lisa Marek, who, as you know, is our senior manager of government relations, is out of town, so she is unable to be with us tonight. And I'm here to present to you the proposed 2025 Advocacy Agenda, which includes both local, state and federal priorities. Lisa walked through the specifics with you at the work session on September 24th. So tonight I am merely going to highlight a few of the changes, thanks to your questions and your comments. The agenda now specifically calls out full funding for the quality education model known as qem, which, as you know, will ensure that not only would PPS forego the potential $40 million in cuts, but it will allow us to offer the type of learning and supports that our kids need and deserve. That is really the major change that we made. The rest of the minor tweaks were merely to clean up some of the redundancies in the language. And that said, I ask you tonight for your I vote and I'm happy.

start time: 352:32:24.000
end time: 361:19:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So on the new report that came out August, I know we have in here 12.7 and then when I look at the report, it talks about 13.526. And of course, that's including the Student Success act transfer. They estimate our projection to be about 8,22,822 million. Can we modify our acts to reflect the number that's in their report?

start time: 361:52:10.000
end time: 363:50:58.000
confidence: 0.97
F: Well, I think that question is up to you, but if you all vote to add that, yes, we can make whatever changes you need to feel comfortable.

start time: 363:52:34.000
end time: 367:39:10.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Yeah, I like to amend the number that we have in there to. To reflect what the Quality Education commission report of 2024, which states 13.526 billion.

start time: 368:28:10.000
end time: 404:12:08.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Oh, yeah. I was going to respond to that really quick. Yep. When I read through these changes, interestingly enough, one thing I didn't like was actually the inclusion of a number. Because one of the ultimate goal, right, for what we're hoping for. The best case scenario that we're hoping for is that Oregon is going to change the whole system, how they fund education. Because the system we have right now is rocky. It goes up and down, up and down, based on the season, based on the economy, and every five, six years, we have to undergo massive cuts. And it's like a big, huge restart as we're letting go of people and institutional knowledge gets lost. And so I think with the thing with an advocacy agenda is that if you put a number in there, then it becomes about the number instead of being about changing the system, if that makes sense. I mean, I'm okay with changing the number. So if you want to vote for a higher number, I'm totally okay with that. I just want to flag the idea that, you know, one possibility is if, you know, like, I flag the worry that if we include the number, like, even if we raise it to 13.5, you don't know, like, maybe like five years from now, because of inflation, raising costs, 13.5 might not even be enough then. Right. So I just. I guess my response is that I. I support that if you want, if that's the way people want to go. But I also think that it'd be. I like the flexibility of not having number, but rather putting in the idea of actually modernizing the QEM and that we should be changing, like Lisa Marek said last board meeting, that what we would like Oregon to have is to have a vision around education and change it to support that vision instead of this kind of piecemeal system we have with unfunded mandates and all these things. So that's my kind of response to that. And again, I am flexible, but I just want to bring that issue up.

start time: 404:13:04.000
end time: 436:15:24.000
confidence: 0.92
C: I'm going to speak in favor of, and I spoke last week of having a number in there, because the reality is, in the next six months, they're going to pick a number. And I think what the number that Director Hollins mentioned does represent a vision and, you know, five years from now. But I think what it does is it puts a stake on the ground. I mean, the reason why I really was supportive of changes is I felt that it was mushy because what is full funding mean? And so I think having a number actually allows staff, teachers, parents, students to speak to a specific number, which the number does speak to the vision. That is what in 1995, when the quality education model first was started, that was the whole thing. It's like how do we design what would an ideal school system look like with the longer school year, lower class sizes, curriculum, all the things that we know that we need. And then that got rolled up into a number. I do think that's still the vision and just get shorthanded into qem, which I don't think sounds very visionary. But if you step back and what it was supposed to be and then this is the funding that would take to get to that model. So I'm like I say, oftentimes especially when you get down to the short strokes in the session, there's not a lot of chit chat. It's just like what is it that you want? So it allows community members to shorthand say exactly what it is that we're advocating for.

start time: 436:18:12.000
end time: 438:56:18.000
confidence: 0.87
B: And I'm just to Director Wong's point, the vision piece and reading from the thing that's 128 pages, I haven't got to do all of it, but almost all of it.

end time: 439:06:42.000

F: Thank you.

start time: 439:08:26.000
end time: 466:56:30.000

B: So they're literally. There are legislative assemblies that's coming right off of their thing. We talk about vision, right? They have a vision, right? Their Legislative assembly believes that education is a major civilizing influence on the development of a human, of a humane, responsible, informed sentencery. No, I got that all wrong. Able to adjust to and grow in a rapid changing world, students must be encouraged to learn of their heritage and their place in a global society. The Legislative assembly concludes that these goals are not inconsistent with the goals to be implemented under this chapter. Some of their goals is to equip students with academic and career skills and information necessary to pursue the future of their choice through a program of rigorous academic preparation and career readiness. To prepare students for successful transitions to the next phase of their educational development. To provide students with their skills necessary to pursue learning throughout their lives in an ever changing world. So they have a vision, right? They have a vision, they have a goal. They just need to fund it at this point, you know, when we, and I get what you're saying, if, if we had funded this and we have come up short, then that could be a conversation for look at changing something. But I don't know, how do you change something that we haven't even done yet? Right. And so that's just my piece on that stuff. There's a lot of stuff going on with the QEM model in this document, which is a great read. It lays out a great vision for where we should go and it even talks about, on page.

B: It says the full implementation of the QEM is not aspirational, it is attainable. Now this is their own document. Let me read that again. It says the full implementation of the QEM is not aspirational, it is attainable. There are several important functions, funding needs that are not represented in the 2024 QEM. They can continue to analyze new input for the, for the future, an integration model. But let's say that again, this is their own document. This is the state document that they put together. The fuel implementation of the QM is not aspirational, it is attainable. So I want to make sure that we're taking that when we go and talk to our state legislators, you know, our representatives that, representatives that are, you know, supposed to be working for our consistent, their consistency, right? The people who vote for them. If they're saying this is what we need to do, then we need to make sure that's a priority, bottom line. And you know, it's, you know, we, we play this political game where we have, you know, one group saying, oh, well, it's this person's fault, it's that person's fault. But in the reality, it's all of our fault for not funding our school districts. It's the reps at the state, senators at the state, our board community. It's all of us that are failing our kids. So we can keep pointing the blame game here and there. Like, you know, the group of folks that decided to go on TV and try to blast the school district, you know, know, around our funding, which, you know, of course they seen it wasn't just us, it was all over the state. But instead of playing this political game, how about we play a game of how do we make this work? You know, so that's, I'm gonna just leave it there.

G: Director Green, I totally agree with and thank you for giving me an opportunity to share with having the number. And I also agree about the fluctuation. I would like to propose that if we're going to put something in there that we indicate that this represents the current QEM model. So if we were to say we're going to, we want to put in this number, which is 13, I think you said it's 13.26 or 13.28 million, whatever the number is, that we include a language that said, which represents 10 current quality education model, because that would give room to say if the number goes up and in five years is 15 billion, then the reason that we asked for this, because it represents the current QEM model and as that number goes up, we Expect to get more money because we're doing this for our kids. And I believe that we need to be blatant, very blatant about it. Stop saying that you care about education if you're not going to fund it. Like, I think we need to say stuff like that. We care more about the houseless community's garbage than we do, than we do our kids because we're not funding them at the, at the same level. Say something weird like that. You gotta get on the heads. That's what I say. It's like, we care. We gotta stop saying we really care about gun violence because we don't.

G: We spend more money taking out trash for the houseless community than we do actually spending money on bonds reduction within our city. And so if we really cared about it, we put money into it. We cared about COVID and we solved it and we're still dealing with it. But everybody dropped everything that they had, sunk all their money into it because it became a national priority. And we said, we got to do something about this no matter what. I think we need to hold them to that kind of fire. We need to be that kind of blatant. And they don't gotta like us. But we're not here to be liked. We're here to change lives. So that's, that's my thought on it.

start time: 533:52:10.000

confidence: 0.96
C: So I, I don't know what's better, to put a hard number in there or to just express a vision, but we just got our outcomes data last week and I'm really interested in, you know, financing or funding what will produce the outcomes that we expect. I think that's important. Every year we come back post Covid and we've got kids that aren't hitting the achievement levels that we expect them.

start time: 558:34:00.000
end time: 580:32:40.000
confidence: 0.93
C: I just want to call out another change that was made that I'm appreciative that's included in here, which is that we're supporting the governor's recommended changes to the current service level budget, but that it must be floor, not the ceiling. That's very important, but. Or maybe it's. And this should be the floor to the ceiling. But the 515 million that she has put in, they're relatively technical changes. I mean, it's. To even explain what they are. They're very technical. But it does add up to a pretty significant amount of money. 550 million, which I think is about 20 million for PDS. But having talked to a couple legislators already, that was like, well, you know, we don't know the perfectly to go along with that. So I'm glad it's in here because that's not an automatic. Just because the governor puts it in the budget, because the legislature has their process. So it should be that and the other pieces would get us to qem. So I'm appreciative of that, that call out. And that's a good early thing to fight for in addition to everything. But it's not automatic just because the governor wants it in the budget.

start time: 580:47:40.000
end time: 584:18:10.000
confidence: 0.94
A: Thank you. Just one question really quick. Is, is it true that if we fund. If they fund the governor's recommended current service level, it would still result in cuts?

B: Yeah. So I'm going to respond to Director Berm Edwards and talk to those who will be making these decisions down in Salem. You know, when we fail to fund education, we're not only undermining our schools, we compound the very issue that our own governor has expressed as parties for the state. Housing, homelessness, behavioral health crisis, and the need for early learning opportunities are all interconnected with education. A poorly funded education system continues the cycle of poverty and homelessness as students who struggle in school are more likely to struggle later in life. It limits access to early learning, which is a key factor in closing achievement gaps before they become insurmountable, and it exacerbates the behavioral health challenges we see in our communities as schools often serve as the front line for identifying, addressing the needs of young people in crisis. So one of the things I want to say is that to all those legislators in Salem, and this is not just a Portland thing, we've been seeing this all over the state. And if our legislators will not step up to the plate, then I think we need to get new legislators.

start time: 613:17:20.000
end time: 622:03:02.000
confidence: 0.95
A: So really quick following up on. First, Director Hollins and Director Green, you're asked. So that the sentence is about the $12.7 billion. We could change that to something like, you know, it says, must take bold steps to modernize the quality education model and fully fund the QEM with a state school fund investment. And we can add comma, which currently sits at $13.5 billion as of 2024. Would that be a change like that would be?

start time: 622:04:46.000
end time: 632:29:10.000
confidence: 0.94
G: I think anything that we can say that is inclusive of which like and represents the current. I think they're a lot smarter in wordsmithing stuff than I am. And so I don't want to tell them what to write. I just want to make sure that they understand the essence of. Of what? The heartbeat. The heartbeat is that something that would say this number, which is a representation of the current. And however they say it, they're smarter than I am. So I'm not going to tell them how to wordsmith something, but I believe that they can do it. But I don't know if we got a vote on that or not. Or do we just.

F: I think in the. The 12.7 number is in the resolution. I think there's a consensus that when you put this on the table, it's not yet on the table. You can make the motion with a replaced number of 13.562 million or billion. Sorry.

A: All right, Just kind of read some quick bullet points here. Really quick. Thank you, Chief Ghafori. Just kind of reminder, this advocacy agenda is really designed to be a framework and a ground that grounds us in our values and priorities, while also at the same time giving us flexibility to respond to bills, initiatives, and proposed budgets as they become available through the year. It's not intended to be a comprehensive document that captures every possible issue we could encounter. I know that the government relations teams will call on us as board members to help advocate this agenda. There's a lot of stake at this this session, and we are going to. We're looking for regular updates from our government's relations team on the progress on these priorities and also other issues that may pop up. Again, just remind, this isn't an ambitious agenda, but I think it's important to accurately portray the extent of our needs and the impact of legislation decisions on our district and ultimately on our kids. We have two resolutions before us today. Our first resolution is focused specifically on the local and federal priorities. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt Resolution 6973 Resolution to adopt the 2025 Portland Public Schools local and federal priorities advocacy agenda. Typed it.

F: Members of the school board, I appreciate the chance to offer testimony today. My name is Christy Splitt, and I'm here on behalf of my children, Delaney and Sylvan, the entire community at Hayhurst Elementary School and the board and members of community and Parents for Public Schools. Launched in 1999 Community and parents for public schools was reignited just this year. And I'm really excited to report that we've been doing a ton of work since, really, since we got started again, we've held two town halls bringing together families, community members and legislators to talk about school funding. We've brought 50 Portland Public Schools families down to Salem during the last legislative session to meet with legislators to talk about school funding. And so we just one, want to make sure you know that we have your back. Hearing the conversation today has been really heartening. I wanted to do this the whole time and just want you to know that we're here doing this hard work so that you're not alone and so that you also know that legislators are hearing from families on just the effect of cuts on our schools and our kids and our families. I also want to point out we're working so hard that our president, Ashley Schofield, can't be here tonight because she's at Creston PTA talking to them about advocacy. We also know of another PTA tonight also doing an advocacy night, bringing families together to talk about how to support increased school funding during the next legislative session. I want to lend my support to the legislative agenda. Thank you so much being brought forward tonight. And to also flag some concerns about the road ahead in Salem. I'm heartened by leadership from Governor Kotak and an increasing number of Portland legislators talking about how important school funding is. We also know, and we're hearing about that dynamic regarding revenue in the state and the conflicting priorities the legislators will have. We want to just really enforce the idea that the district can and should continue to demand full funding for schools, regardless of that dynamic, to push forward and say we need that QEM met in order for our kids and our staff and our teachers and our administrators to get the support that they need to accomplish goals. So just want to make sure you know that you have support to continue to go big instead of feeling like you need to bend to some sort of dynamic of what's possible. I also just want to say that you all addressed a concern that I have a whole paragraph about so I can skip it about adding that 822 million from the Student Success act to get to the actual 13.526 billion number. So thank you for catching that concern and making that happen. So we are indeed asking for the closest thing that we have to a statewide goal that we can point to with other school districts. We know the QEM is due for an update. There's a lot of conversations about that, but it doesn't mean we need to shove it aside. It's still something that we can aim for until we have something better to aim for in the Future. That was three minutes.

F: 30 second Oregon test scores this week continue to demonstrate what decades of underfunding can do to a system. Really can't say enough about the work PPS does to kind of buck that dynamic. I also just want to know that my kids started kindergarten during the pandemic. We've had cuts every single year since we started at school to our staff at our school, including even this fall, losing half of our special ed supports at our school. And I wasn't surprised to see our third grade scores be lower. It was a market decline because our school has less grownups. And these are the kids that have had that experience the whole time. So I just wanted to make sure that you all know that we see those cuts, and we really are glad to stand with you. And finally, just to look really quickly, we can be civil with our state's elected leaders, and I know you will be, and we will be, too. But we also need to make sure civility does not mean agreeing to or accepting the status quo. So we're here to join you in bucking that trend together and look forward to working together next session and the session after that and the one after that. Maybe the one after that until we get to fully funded schools in Oregon and in Portland.

I think we have the opportunity to head to Salem really strong and united with our parents, with our students, their staff, with our teachers, and with other superintendents and school boards around the state. So I think this is going to be a very strong effort by all of us. Thank you.

And as you all know, we had some disruptions in the last academic year. And tonight we're asking you to approve exemptions for time which at this point cannot be made up. And we need to approve it in order to be in compliance. And so Dr. Proctor is going to walk you through our recommendations for exemptions that we are requesting. Thank you, Dr. Proctor.

E: Yeah, as required annually. Right. So MIC is hot. So as you know, each year we present updates to the board on where we stand with instructional time and with the number of interruptions that we had last year. As was outlined in the staff report, we were looking at a number of schools that fall short of the required instructional time.

start time: 881:13:30.000
end time: 881:25:50.000

C: So.

start time: 882:00:00.000
end time: 907:58:00.000

E: OAR Required Instructional times allows for districts in Oregon to use exemptions to ensure compliance with this OAR's rule. During the 24232324 school year there were several disruptions as we noted in the calendar. We made district wide adjustments to recover times with our strike and those plans had all grade levels meeting instructional requirements across the district. We had a three hour early release day on Friday January 12th and we experienced after the Martin Luther king holiday closures January 16th to the new 19th due to the winter storm. So with this, what we are looking at is, you know, specific schools. The analysis of the situation is that we have specific schools that are out of compliance for the required instructional time. Schools are as follows with grade levels, all Kindergarten students, all seniors Aster K 8 all grades Ainsworth elementary all grades Forest Park elementary all grades Markham elementary all grades Skyline K 8 grades K through 5 Alliance High School Alternative High.

start time: 907:58:40.000
end time: 908:08:20.000

C: School.

start time: 908:42:40.000
end time: 991:30:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Metropolitan MLC Alternative School. So in the report we outlined by date the number of hours missed of instructional time per school. It's important for me to note that while the state requires all school districts to ensure that at least 92% of all students in the district and at least 80% of all students at each school operated by the district are scheduled to receive annual annually the minimum power. So instead, instructional time as follows. Grade 12, 966 hours. Grade 9 through 11990 hours and then grades K8 900 hours. So after our recommendation, after you've had an opportunity to read the full staff report with the justification of of what has occurred within each school that is out of compliance for instructional time, our recommendation is option one for kindergarten. Excuse me, Kindergarten students did not meet the minimum 900 hours due to the winter storm in January. Across the district, Kindergarten has three fewer instructional days as compared to all other grade levels. As there are three days built into the calendar to welcome families and students to school. These three days combined with the district wide inclement weather days means that all kindergarten received less than the required time. So with that this is again exasperated exacerbated four schools that remained closed due to the storm damage. Forest park had the longest closure which resulted in a 55 hour shortfall. So for kindergarten, the option is one required instructional time, exemption 6A and emergency emergency closure hours. In order for Portland Public Schools to be in compliance with the required instructional time, as we've reported, we can count the 14 emergency hours approved already by ODE. In addition, we would also need to request exemption 6A upon all the local school. Upon approval by the local school board, the district may include a calculation of instructional time required in subsection one of this rule for kindergarten programs offering 900 or more hours of instructional time up to 60 hours of recess. So to include up to 60 hours of recess and then you know, outside of that making up the time that is required, we are able to to make up the time required with your approval of option one. Outside of that, we would not be in compliance in terms of our alternative schools, namely Alliance High School and mlc. We are requesting that the board approve required instructional time exemption 4 for Portland Public Schools to be in compliance with with requirement of instructional time. As reported in Division 22, the board will need to approve Exemption 4 for Alliance High School and MLC. And I included the language there for the exemption. So the permission will be granted where we could again meet those those requirements for alliance and MLC schools. Okay, so that is a summary of what was in the staff report. In addition, I do want to note that the question that was raised previously regarding our high schools and at least that 80% of our students being scheduled with a full schedule. All of our high schools are in compliance with that scheduling requirement. With the exception of one where the school is currently working with the eight students that are outside of having the full schedule. And we'll be making adjustments in those schedules as well, thus ultimately bringing all of our schools into compliance. But all schools are in compliance as of today with the exception exception of one. All right, any questions Just regarding the.

start time: 994:43:00.000
end time: 998:55:32.000
confidence: 0.94
E: That was a separate notation that I wanted to make for the board that in the high school schedule, it is also noted that that at least 80% of our students in the high schools need to have a full schedule represented.

start time: 998:56:36.000
end time: 999:09:56.000

A: For the high school.

start time: 999:11:08.000
end time: 1004:32:30.000
confidence: 0.94
E: You have some school students that have early dismissal. You have some students that have late arrival. And the ruling is that we have at least 80% of the high school students, all with a full schedule for the required Instruction. Okay, it worked.

start time: 1004:42:10.000
end time: 1020:45:50.000
confidence: 0.90
C: So the background for that, Director Silva, is that in 2012, the district required all of our high schools but two to schedule students in not a full school day. So students were scheduled anywhere from five to seven classes versus eight, thereby shortchanging them about three weeks of instruction. And there was a complaint filed against pps, ODE found for the parents. And as a result of that, this standard was implemented statewide because it's essentially students were just had late arrival, early dismissal during double lunch, and sometimes kids weren't going to school till noon.

start time: 1020:56:50.000
end time: 1023:07:10.000
confidence: 0.95
F: And so this change helped. Helped us make ourselves right after the storm somehow.

start time: 1023:12:50.000
end time: 1028:14:40.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yeah, yeah, we're definitely in class. And if you can imagine, then that would be. That would mean more students would not have the required instructional time by the state. So in order to stay within the state rule, we review where each high school is in meeting that requirement. And.

start time: 1028:25:00.000
end time: 1030:34:40.000
confidence: 0.86
C: Yeah, so question being eight students off, is that this year or last year?

end time: 1035:10:10.000
confidence: 0.87
E: That's. That is. That is actually this year. So we're. We're monitoring. Each year. We're monitoring where our schools are in terms of being in compliance.

end time: 1038:25:50.000
confidence: 0.82
C: Great. So we had a plan to get.

start time: 1038:27:50.000
end time: 1049:09:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Yes. So, yeah, noted at the top of the memo. We did indicate any high schools specifically with the exception of again, the alliance program at mlc. But all in general, all the high schools, we did have seniors that miss instructional time, not to say missed instructional time, but are also in the fold of needing your approval for us to be in compliance with the instructional minutes similar to kindergarten and those specific schools outlined that were heavily impacted by the winter storm.

start time: 1049:39:00.000
end time: 1051:46:00.000
confidence: 0.90
C: What's the penalty for non compliance for those kindergarteners who didn't meet the instructional hours?

B: Yeah.

start time: 1053:41:32.000
end time: 1067:45:30.000
confidence: 0.92
E: So being out of compliance, you know, if the vote does not go and we are out of compliance, the board could choose again to not apply the allowable exemptions and be out of compliance for kindergarten students. Given the extraordinary circumstances of the year, our plan is to correct this would increase the instructional time by extending again the student day. In terms of what the direct consequences for being out of compliance, we would have to fall into some kind of corrective action with ode. But outside of that, we've always been managed to with the board approval to be in compliance.

start time: 1067:51:10.000
end time: 1069:07:00.000
confidence: 0.86

start time: 1069:48:40.000
end time: 1076:57:10.000
confidence: 0.93
E: And just remember that those, you know, again, those 14 hours that noting the winter storm and the impact that that it had across the state ODE was gracious enough to go ahead and allow that as an exemption up front. So many districts have chosen to take the benefit of that that and this is what we're asking the board to approve today.

A: Any other questions for Dr. Proctor before moving this putting it on table? I just want to make one comment. This is just another example of where our state funding needs fixing because I mean we had closings of Ainsworth, Robert Gray Markham Forest park due to severe weather. One thing that our state does not do is fund facilities maintenance and capital. We have generous. Our community is so generous in passing our bonds and we have grants and stuff like that. But those are one time things. It's very different when we have consistent funding that can deal with facilities maintenance and things like that. So I just want to kind of flag this. This is an example of one thing where we could ask you know Salem, you could make this change and we could have a lot more students in school more often. So please. So I'm just sorry. Do I have a motion and a second to adopt resolution 6972 resolution to approve OAR 5810222320 required instructional time exemptions 4 and 6. A school district may request permission to exempt an alternative education program.

start time: 1098:57:50.000

A: Director Green moves and Director Holland seconds. Is there any board discussion?

start time: 1101:17:50.000
end time: 1145:05:38.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Yeah, I look at the resolution. I don't have any issue with the compliance for the second part of having getting a compliance by counting 16 hours of recess for kindergarten and using 30 hours staff professional development time. From my perspective like I wouldn't count those as instructional time and so I'm not going to be supportive. In the past there have been times when the board has just decided that there's not necessarily a penalty for non compliance. And again I was part of this group that spent several years with ODE and parents and the School Boards association cosa, the state PTA trying to set standards. There was a big push to count things that we wouldn't consider to be instruction as instruction and given and we did this whole Nationally at the number of hours that Oregon students took in we're among the lowest in the country. In fact I think if you add up Washington State's they do it by they do hours as well but it's something like their students get a whole extra year of school because they have more instructional hours. So there was pressure to count a whole bunch of things that weren't I don't think that we would consider instruction as instruction to meet the 990 when that wasn't actually instruction anyway. So from my perspective, I really appreciate the point you made about the facilities because I think that's a great point. But they're also. We can also change our calendar in the sense of accounting for more making up snow days. And then there's some things that, you know, I'm noticing in here, like Harrison park last year lost a day for construction. They lost, I think two to three days this year for construction. Those, to me, those instructional hours are like precious. And I don't. I want to keep the pressure on to really build our calendars and our advocacy and everything we do to increase instructional time versus say that something like staff professional development day, that students aren't even in school is instructional time.

start time: 1145:06:34.000
end time: 1145:16:30.000

E: So.

start time: 1145:22:50.000

start time: 1146:54:50.000
end time: 1156:16:50.000
confidence: 0.96
E: And just for a point of clarification, what we are proposing are all allowable by the state, as you just noted. I think it's really in the instance of those extraneous situations where, you know, again, like the two notations last year of schools being closed with the strike and the ice storm, that we are looking at taking some of those allowable modifications to the instructional time so that we can be in compliance.

start time: 1156:35:50.000
end time: 1171:23:00.000
confidence: 0.94
C: That didn't mean to imply at all that they weren't allowed. I mean, they were written into statute. But there was a lot of conversation about how much would be allowed. And frankly, there were a lot. There used to be a lot more of them that were allowed when actually students weren't even in school. So it's better now, having been on the board now for a fair number of time, we have things come up all the time and I guess there's not really a penalty besides you have to plan and correct it. I think that's fine to do and just acknowledge we're out of compliance, that we were out of compliance, but we're moving back into compliance. We're still is saying we're going to use some time that really isn't student instructional time to count as instructional hours.

I don't love it. I think Director Bermember's points are really good, you know, because I don't think we want to pretend. I think we want to be really transparent. There's a lot happened last year that resulted in this. But one of the things that I really want to stress is, you know, the facility failures that resulted in kids missing school are going to continue. But I want to be really clear. They're not continuing because Portland Public Schools doesn't know what we're doing or we're somehow making bad decisions.

start time: 1185:55:08.000
end time: 1213:28:32.000
confidence: 0.96
H: They're. They're going to continue because the state doesn't give us enough money to both fully fund our classrooms and fully fund our maintenance. And it's one of the things that I've gone back and forth with a lot of parents who get angry and, you know, those, those schools are in my zone, you know, Markham Gray and, you know, they were really angry. Why didn't the district fund this maintenance previously? And, you know, as though it was just. We could have just done it and there would have been no impact. And one of the examples I used with some of them was to say, well, let me go back in time a year ago. What if I had told you, hey, I've got a plan to fix your roof and your plumbing systems and a couple other things that need to be fixed so that they won't freeze in a storm? And everyone would say, well, that's great. And I said, great. All we need to do is take away three of your teachers this next year from the classroom and we'll be able to do it. And I guarantee that every one of those schools would have said, oh, hell no. Like, that is not a trade off we're okay with, but that is the trade off we as a district have been facing for years. And so I just want to be really clear. To the extent the state continues to underfund education, our facilities will continue to fail. And to the extent our facilities continue to fail, our kids will continue to miss school as a result. Our bonds are incredible. Our support for our bonds from our voters is incredible. It's allowed us to redo the high schools. Our high schools are not likely to fail because they've been redone with a couple left. But all these other facilities, it's going to take 10, 20, 30 years to make that progress. But that will go a lot more quickly if we have a legislature that fully funds education in the state because it will allow us to be able to do some of that preventative maintenance that will keep our kids in school. So I just, I don't want to lose that point. Director Wong, Chair Wong, you already made it, but I just really want to amplify it.

So thank you for bringing that up. Just wanted to put climate change in there because that's a contributing factor.

We look forward to hearing your thoughts and reflections. Our board office may follow up if there are board related issues or questions. We request that complaints about individual employees be directed to the superintendent's office as a personnel matter. For materials you would like the board to receive, please hand them to Ms. Powell. And then just a reminder, if you are giving public comments. Sorry. Just be aware about public testimony about not providing testimony about students that could violate confidential protections under ferpa. This includes testimony using information that could identify students, especially in their schools, by use of direct or indirect linkages such as school grade, special education, or other status. Please make sure when you begin your comments that you clearly state your name and spell your last name. You will have three minutes to speak. You'll hear a sound after three minutes, which means you have 30 seconds to finish up. Thank you. You may start when you're ready.

I: Okay. My name is Garrett Hillier. The last name is H I L L Y E R Good evening Directors. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you all and for the work you do throughout the year. I'm here to request that the Board ensures Saban elementary School's compliance with the City of Portland's Title 18 noise control code. Title 18 limits sound producing equipment to 55 decibels at the property line, roughly equivalent to a normal conversation between two people, and requires a variance for louder events. The laws outlined by Title 18 aim to promote health and the common good, while noise variances offer a fair compromise allowing entities to hold louder events on fixed days and times if they provide proper written notice to the surrounding community. The variances also provide for neutral oversight by the Portland Noise Office. For the past two years at least the past two years, Saban elementary has repeatedly violated Title 18 during their weekly Friday dance party events even after receiving messages of concern from the community throughout that period. In April of this year, Saban procured a noise variance from the Portland Noise Office following significant push and pull between the school and the community. Unfortunately, the school has violated that variance at least 10 documented times within a six month period, often starting or continuing their Friday dance parties outside the hours outlined in the variance and holding related music non related music events that have no variance at all. One particularly disruptive event two weeks ago lasting from 7:55am to 10:51am measured 100 decibels of the property line, roughly equivalent to a concert, and caused widespread concern among the community. Despite prior requests from the community to Sabin that it procure a variance before once again breaking the the law. In other words, they knowingly chose to violate the law. As a former high school teacher and current college professor, I fully support Students Right to Joy and the school's efforts to hold music events that foster community and enjoyment. However, it is crucial that these events comply with city laws. Continued violations of those laws not only disrupt the surrounding neighborhood, but also erode trust between the school and the community. I understand some may view this issue as minor. But the solution to addressing rules we believe to be minor is not simply to break them. For example, I would like five minutes to speak to you all tonight, not three and a half. After all, it's only an extra minute or so, which seems pretty minor to me. But would it be rational or respectful to ignore the rules set by this board simply because I disagree with them? No, it would not. What's more, as an educator, I try to set an example for my students. I ask them to follow rules. And so I strive to as well. I therefore hope this board agrees that laws exist for a reason. And I am respectfully asking you to ensure that Saban elementary and its leadership follow them. You can do this in a number of ways, including emailing the co applicants of Sabin's noise variance, which I sent to this board earlier today, reminding them of the language in that noise variance, which they again applied for and agreed to.

end time: 1348:40:10.000
confidence: 0.96
I: Yeah. So the one that they have a variance for, they're calling Friday dance parties. They basically are a recess event where there's loud music playing. And again, I totally support them having the event. It looks fun and I understand it. They just need to apply for a variance with the city. And then once they have that variance with the set dates and times, the current variance says every Friday between. I think the current variance is 1145-1245. They need to stick to that. If they don't, they're in violation of the law.

start time: 1359:02:50.000
end time: 1375:48:40.000
confidence: 0.97
I: I would say anecdotally, maybe 10 to 15. It's a little bit difficult to Get a number. I haven't done a survey or anything like that. I've just talked with neighbors. In regard to the event I referenced two weeks ago, there was something of a firestorm on the Nextdoor app. There were about 53 comments from different people. I called the school very respectfully, meekly, humbly, you know, saying, hey, you know, this event is violating the noise variance that you all have. And the staff member told me, oh, thank you for being so nice. We've gotten tons of calls today from angry people, so I don't know the number. I would just like to say, Director Hollins, with all due respect, the number is really irrelevant. It's not incumbent upon me to do a survey and show you all how many people feel that the law is being violated. It's incumbent upon the school, especially as a municipal institution and quite frankly, one of education, to follow the law. I respect, again, that you might think that the issue is minor, but it is a city law. And the answer, again, is not to break it. It's to go through the proper democratic steps to change it.

F: My name is Alison Tarka. Tarka. I've been a PPS parent and volunteer for the last 13 years. All three of our kids currently attend PPS schools and I'd like to shout out the McDaniel High School and Scott Elementary. We love both communities and our kids are thriving there. Tonight I am showing up as a board member for a REC basketball organization who runs teams at our neighborhood school for the Golden Ball program with Portland Parks and Rec. Last year we had over 80 third through fifth graders on 10 teams from Scott School. Our organization is run on volunteers, grants and a minimal registration fee for students at our Title one school. I'm here to bring attention to the current civic use of buildings or CUB situation for outside groups and volunteers who serve students and sponsor events that create enrichment and opportunities for PPS students, families and neighborhoods. Currently, CUBS policy, administrative directives and practices are outdated, inequitable and prohibitive to groups and volunteers attempting to use PPS building space. This year, liability insurance has become an absolute requirement for every single group wanting to schedule space. They must now show proof of insurance or purchase insurance directly through Facilitron, the new system. The insurance costs, in addition to building fees are now cost free, prohibitive for many and probably most of the groups who sponsor these events. In our school buildings each week. Estimates are calculated in the hundreds and thousands of dollars. If PPS truly desires its building space to house robust programming that is equitable and accessible outside of school hours, then current practices need to be revised. What I'm asking Number one Change the system and requirements to effectively support the PPS mission and vision for students. Revise the entire administrative directive and give priority to groups that directly work with and for students above and beyond just PTA and Sun School, for example. Number three allow these priority groups to come under PPS liability coverage. 4. Provide a public comment period and with community input as the speaker impacts our entire school system. These changes were made with seemingly zero input from the community. In addition, the new Facilitron system and its confusing rollout to the community has greatly lacked in training and communication from pps. No group was able to anticipate or prepare for these outrageous costs. Groups this day are scrambling to get events scheduled in the very near future and find a way to pay for it. Volunteers should not have to cough up funds for insurance in addition to building fees. Our group was lucky in our situation as Golden Ball and PPS found a solution that better served our school. We are really grateful for this, but it shouldn't take luck to accomplish this. Finally, I'd like to thank Patty in the CUB office who has been very helpful to our group as we navigate the new Facilitron system.

A: Yes, thank you. And you have the email to send that in? Yes, thank you. Thanks for taking time to see tonight. Thank you to the Superintendent of the Board. My name is Derek Ranta R A N T A I am a parent of three students at Cleveland High School. Lifelong Portland Public School family. I myself went to Portland Public Schools. My dad went to Portland Public Schools. My grandfather again parents all went to Portland Public Schools. So we're a fourth generation family. We're hoping to get an invite to the Salem Friday Dance Festivals or Sabin Friday Morning Dance Festivals. Those sound fantastic, so I wish our school had done the same back in the day. But tonight I know you grapple with a lot of very serious issues, but I'm here just to ask you for one simple thing. Well, actually two simple things. As a parent at Cleveland, I also represent the Cleveland High Boosters Club in support of our athletic program. The two things I'm asking for are two lights to be added to the outside of the stadium. At Cleveland, we've been requesting this for a number of years now, but if anybody has been to the Cleveland High School stadium, it affronts 31st Avenue. 31st is also on Powell, and we get a lot of individuals down in that area. My wife and I spend hours cleaning 31st Avenue and have a very direct knowledge of the materials that are found out there. Drug needles, all sorts of paraphernalia.

I: Right.

start time: 1474:07:12.000
end time: 1500:25:22.000
confidence: 0.95
A: And the issue that we have is that the kids are exiting the stadium at night in dark circumstances. It's an inner city school with one athletic facility that all sports teams have to share. You've probably heard this message a few times, but it makes it a real challenge as girls, young girls, young athletes of all ages are exiting the facility in the dark. They could be stepping on needles, they could be entering, changing with some of these individuals and having interactions they don't really need to have at that time. All we're asking for is two lights to be added to the exterior of the stadium that would shine out towards the street. That would provide the students a safer outcome as they're leaving the facility. I think it's a reasonable ask. I've requested it from the school. I've requested it from facilities management at Portland Public Schools. If it's a matter of funding, I'm sure the boosters club would be happy to work with the school. However, we need to know what that cost is, what the process looks like, why we can't move forward on it. We're already in the middle of fall. We're halfway through the fall season. That dark night is upon us now. I really want to have my kids and the kids in the program feel safe exiting the stadium. I have an 82 year old mother who wants to go see her granddaughters play soccer. She doesn't feel safe going to that stadium because the darkness that she has to go through to get to that. And so what I'm asking for is just some form of path forward so we can make that change. We're willing to help with funding. I'm personally willing to help with funding, but I just need somebody to tell me how we can get there. So thank you for your time. Thank you for bringing that to our attention. Did you want to respond? Yeah, it was just to Superintendent Armstrong. If we could get a follow up.

E: Okay. Well, as we power through. Thank you, Roseanne. As we power through to the next slide and the next, I'm going to give a very brief overview of Division 22 as it was noted in the next slide. Yep, right there. That this is really just the the standard to which Oregon Administrative rule has set through Division 22 for Public Education elementary and secondary schools. The standard is meant to be the floor, meaning the baseline. And this is what all schools and districts need to have in place. Compliance with these rules ensure again that there's a baseline level of service across the entire state. Next slide. So these are. There are category rules and the category rules are bucketed into four buckets. Teaching and learning, Health and safety, District performance and accountability and human resources and staffing. And the next slide will give you you just a little bit more about each. Under teaching and learning, of course, we have curriculum and instruction, assessments and reporting, program and service requirements, High school diploma under health and safety, we have policies and practices plans and reports and athletic and interscholastic activities. And with our district performance and accountability, there are compliance procedures to ensure that we're meeting those measures. And similarly with human resources and staffing that we're doing the baseline that is required by the state, things like fingerprinting.

E: Next slide. So there are a number of resources that we go to for information on how best we can meet the requirements of the state for each of these rules. And we just highlighted three of those resources, which is the ODE Rules at a Glance Summary of State Secretary of State's Oregon Administrative rules database and ODE's Division 22 standards newsletter. Plus, we are in regular communication with ODE and their department to ensure that we are meeting the required standards and measures. Next slide. So you know what I want you to take away from this slide that's titled what are the Division 22 standard assurances? There are three major things that there's a combined accountability model, that there is local accountability in that we need to report these measures and how we are meeting the measures to our local school board. And then of course, state accountability. By November 15, districts must submit assurances to ODE noting that we have met all of said requirements. Next slide. So this is our why it signals our commitment to providing high quality education experiences and equitable opportunities to all students. Division 22 standards articulate the floor of the education to be provided to students, not the ceiling. And the assurances process offers an opportunity for districts not in Compliance to reflect on areas where we could actually do better and how we could receive technical assistance to come into compliance. And what happens if the districts are out of compliance? We can move into a corrective action. The state offers technical assistance with plan. We continue to provide. The state continues to provide support to districts with their ODE specialists. The corrective action then must be completed by the beginning of the next school year. And if district fails again to come back into compliance, there is some impact on state funding of monies. So this is our report for our 2324 school year last year. When it comes to waivers, it's important to note that the essential skills graduation requirement was waived for students graduating through the end of 2728 school year. So it is not currently a requirement. And the state has waived that similarly essential skills assessment for English language learners. This related policy requirement has also been waived for the same school year. 27:28.

B: So these assessments are not required from the state, but do we still do them or. We don't do them either.

start time: 1665:27:48.000
end time: 1665:56:00.000

confidence: 0.92
E: All right, next slide. That's fine. All right, here we are. So there are new rules. New rule in effect for Last year was 23:24.

start time: 1673:17:10.000
end time: 1673:20:30.000
confidence: 0.64
C: School.

start time: 1673:21:10.000
end time: 1682:14:16.000
confidence: 0.91
E: School year was menstrual dignity for students. It was adopted by the state board of Education. Excuse me. In October 2023. This was the first time districts are reporting on whether or not we're being in compliance with this rule. It requires free and accessible products in every school, school bathroom, K12. And there are specific instructions and guidelines that were provided.

start time: 1682:16:08.000
end time: 1682:39:40.000
confidence: 0.93
C: That was a new rule.

start time: 1682:45:20.000
end time: 1682:56:56.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Another question.

start time: 1682:58:08.000
end time: 1683:09:00.000
confidence: 0.79
A: Yes.

start time: 1683:17:20.000
end time: 1683:53:12.000
confidence: 0.97
B: So this is a state mandate, right?

start time: 1683:54:56.000
end time: 1684:03:20.000
confidence: 0.62
C: Correct.

start time: 1684:04:40.000
end time: 1685:54:20.000
confidence: 0.98
B: Do they provide any funding for these free things that we need to put in every bathroom?

start time: 1686:26:40.000
end time: 1690:39:50.000
confidence: 0.98
E: I would have to follow up with you on that. But as far as directly, you know, we have. We work through our operations and through our teams to make sure that they are provided.

start time: 1690:50:50.000
end time: 1693:50:58.000
confidence: 0.95
B: So we have to take this out of our general funds that could go towards instruction with this new mandate that the state is doing without any additional funding. Okay, I'm just making sure.

start time: 1693:53:14.000
end time: 1694:59:56.000
confidence: 0.98
A: Yeah. And then my question. Does this apply to contracted alternative schools as well?

start time: 1695:02:28.000
end time: 1696:13:32.000
confidence: 0.94
E: All bathrooms? Yes. All bathrooms in K12 settings?

start time: 1696:14:36.000
end time: 1698:00:00.000
confidence: 0.60
C: Yes. Okay.

start time: 1698:31:00.000
end time: 1716:32:10.000
confidence: 0.95
E: So with that we'll go to the next slide. There was a rule revision regarding health services for last year. New requirements were adopted by the state board of education in June of 2023 and requires school districts to develop, implement and annually update a written prevention oriented health services plan for all students. And in our reporting to the board, we linked a copy of that plan. Next slide. All right. So for compliance for Division 22 standards for 2324 Portland Public Schools is in compliance with Division 22, all standards with the exception of PE. Next slide. We are currently in partial compliance where 45% of PPS schools with grades 6 to 8.

start time: 1717:13:10.000
end time: 1717:23:10.000
confidence: 0.76
C: Excuse me.

start time: 1717:23:50.000
end time: 1806:37:16.000
confidence: 0.94
E: During the 2324 school year, PPS was partially compliant. 45% of PPS schools with Grades 6 to 8 were 100% compliant with this standard. One barrier to full implementation of our 3/4 of PE for for all students in 6th 8th grades is physical space, PPS facilities and health. PE teams were able to collaborate and bring 79% of PPS schools with grades 6 to 8 into 100% compliance and the remaining 21% to 75% compliance by the start of this school year 2425, which maintains again that partial compliance status. There are six schools that are remaining that we're working to ensure compliance and those six schools are Chavez, da Vinci, George Ockley Green and MLC and Winter Haven. In order to address the needs for space in many K8 and comprehensive middle schools, movement labs were created. Movement labs have been created in either underutilized spaces or classrooms or unused spaces. These labs include a variety of equipment options and final determinations of appropriate spaces was made in collaboration with our people. Again with these schools, we were able to make some modifications. But with middle grade students shifting from the five of seven to make room for three quarters of PE in grade six to eight for this fall, we still have those six schools that are in need. And in order to come into full compliance on the next slide, the movement labs are still needed in those six schools identified. And it really is about facility, space and funding to make it happen. Next slide. Curriculum adoption for Science. For the 202324 school year, we are in compliance again with K8s in grades 9 through 12. We will be adopting. We postpone the adoption for this year with approval from the state. And we will be adopting for the spring of 2025 and looking ahead in terms of compliance going to the next slide and the next slide we have our. Regarding district curriculum beginning. Beginning this year, districts must have a planned K12 instructional program for social emotional learning and a planned 912 instructional program which introduces personal finance and higher education and career path skills content standards. And we are currently in implementing those areas. And regarding diploma requirements, credit requirements for students who were first enrolled in ninth grade during the 2324 school year or first enrolled in ninth grade and any subsequent school year must include again that 0.5 credit for personal finance and then another 5 credit for higher education Career pathways modified Diploma, extended diploma and certificates of attendance. Pps, along with other districts must annually provide parents information about diploma availability and requirements and disclosures about certificates of attendance or on site access to all courses is required for a diploma at all high schools. So we are moving forward with those new and revised rules. In addition to substance use prevention and intervention plan, which is the requirement for a comprehensive plan of substance use prevention and intervention, which includes K12 substance use prevention education that meets again the health education standards, it requires a minimum of one ODE, opioid prevention education lesson in grades 6, 7 and 8 and then.

start time: 1806:38:28.000
end time: 1807:02:00.000
confidence: 0.99
A: Once in high school.

start time: 1807:48:20.000
end time: 1830:49:20.000
confidence: 0.95
E: When it comes to compliance for the next. Sorry, keep clicking and moving forward. Next slide. Again, when it comes to compliance for the 2425 school year, we are working towards meeting all standards for compliance and continue to work to make revisions, particularly in pe. Now, when it comes to district curriculum, we've linked for the board's review our SEL care and community scope and sequence, our SEL way finder 6, 8, you know, SEL programming in the classroom for culture, personal finance education and higher education and career path skills. These programmatic elements were linked into the report and into the slides again so that the directors at your will can see some of the measures that we are taking to ensure that we will continue to be in compliance for this current year, which will be reported out again next fall. And that concludes my presentation.

start time: 1832:43:56.000
end time: 1839:11:30.000
confidence: 0.94
F: I had one, yes. I saw in the report that this year, I think is the first year that students in grades three through eight and one time in high school conduct a local performance assessment in writing, speaking, mathematical problem solving and scientific inquiry. And I just wondered what that is exactly. Is that a public speaking thing?

start time: 1839:23:10.000
end time: 1840:07:02.000
confidence: 0.94

F: The part that said where you were out of compliance before. Is it page three? Yeah, page.

start time: 1844:35:20.000
end time: 1851:51:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Oh, I just didn't know what it was. Yeah, this is the. This is the same thing that we were talking about with this, the social, emotional elements. Did you say page three?

start time: 1852:35:30.000
end time: 1853:16:30.000
confidence: 0.97

end time: 1860:10:44.000
confidence: 0.93
F: I just had no idea what it is.

start time: 1860:12:12.000
end time: 1869:10:04.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah. But what we could do is we could definitely give you more detail about that and what it looks like. But it is happening this school year currently for the first time. And it kind of goes in line with performance assessments, I think that are required for monitoring our student performance. But we could definitely get more.

start time: 1869:11:32.000
end time: 1870:12:40.000
confidence: 0.92
F: Yeah, I'd like to know what students actually do.

start time: 1871:52:20.000
end time: 1872:26:40.000
confidence: 1.00
A: Thank you. Any other questions?

start time: 1873:37:50.000
end time: 1882:37:00.000
confidence: 0.91
C: I think there were a couple reports. Hopefully I have the right one. I think there were corrections made. So hopefully I have the right one that I'm asking. So this is the 2324 School Year Division 22 report. Right. So if we hadn't just. If the board had just done the exemptions for instructional hours, would the district be reporting that it was out of compliance?

start time: 1883:50:40.000
end time: 1884:03:40.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Yes.

start time: 1884:16:00.000
end time: 1887:30:00.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Instructional hours are Division 22 and 2 requirements. So the fact that we. The fact that the board just provided exemptions means that otherwise it would have been on this report.

start time: 1887:37:40.000
end time: 1887:52:00.000
confidence: 0.98
E: Correct.

start time: 1888:19:00.000
end time: 1903:29:40.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Okay, so another Division 22. So instructional hours have been just historically issues for PPS. And the other ongoing issue for the last 20 years has been TAG compliance. And I'm noting here that it says during the 2223 school year the district was unable to verify that every TAG student in every PPS classroom had their rate and level of learning interest. So that was, I think the same thing as last year, maybe the year before. And my question is, do we have. Is that viewed as like that's aspirational that we could verify that or even do it or we'd just be potentially out of compliance with a standard.

start time: 1904:16:40.000
end time: 1909:33:30.000
confidence: 0.93
E: We're currently working with ODE to ensure that we're better in compliance with this. I will have someone from the TAG team come present more information specifically about.

start time: 1909:34:10.000
end time: 1914:18:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: How we're going to go about doing that. Okay, I guess I'm confused because why is it that. Where are we measuring the 2223 school year? If this is the 2324 report? That may be.

start time: 1915:23:40.000
end time: 1922:52:24.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I think if you go to the header, it's a comparative of 2223 compliance in 2223 and 2324. But we did do the reporting for to 2324.

start time: 1922:55:12.000
end time: 1934:57:20.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Okay. But last year we were still out of compliance. You can follow up after afterwards. But just understanding because I know the corrective action plan or the consolidation agreement is very lengthy. It's just we've had this for several years. When I look at it in 17 very. It's very high bar which set high standards. And I'm wondering if in our. Again, I don't need this sign whether our agreement has us on a path to do that or just the district will be perpetually not in a plan.

start time: 1935:03:40.000
end time: 1936:02:28.000
confidence: 0.93
E: We can definitely follow up with that question.

start time: 1936:04:44.000
end time: 1940:08:22.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Okay, then the next question I had was around IP and I don't need this tonight, but I had never heard of respiration rates being an issue of why the district wouldn't be incomplete.

start time: 1940:09:26.000
end time: 1940:32:22.000
confidence: 0.98
G: I don't even quite know what it is.

start time: 1940:32:46.000
end time: 1942:27:30.000
confidence: 0.94
C: I mean, I can imagine and I don't even need an answer tonight, but I would be interested what that is.

start time: 1942:52:30.000
end time: 1944:43:40.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Is there CO2 level measurements in a classroom especially important after like the COVID.

start time: 1944:50:00.000
end time: 1954:00:58.000
confidence: 0.90
C: Yeah, I mean, is it, I guess. Is there some sort of formula that we can use? Again, I don't need the answer tonight, but I'm interested in what that means. And then I had the same question, I think as Director Sullivan on the Essential Skills, because are we listing it here because it used to be required but it's been waived, or is this something else?

start time: 1954:02:34.000
end time: 1954:19:10.000
confidence: 0.93
E: It's waived.

start time: 1954:38:10.000
end time: 1955:38:50.000
confidence: 0.85
C: Then why are we listening? I mean, confused about are you looking.

start time: 1955:39:30.000
end time: 1956:03:38.000
confidence: 0.87
E: At the staff member?

start time: 1956:05:54.000
end time: 1962:01:00.000
confidence: 0.89
C: I am. And so I'm wondering if it's my understanding waived till 2627 or 2728. Is that why we would be listing ourselves as not in compliance?

start time: 1964:05:20.000
end time: 1965:54:22.000
confidence: 0.94
E: I think we were just making the notation. But I will definitely make sure that.

start time: 1965:54:46.000
end time: 1984:14:40.000
confidence: 0.92
C: We have an updated staff report for today. My last point, and this is going to go back to earlier in the meeting and it revolves around the legislative session. I know you read a statement that said that staff gives general guidelines, that staff had some flexibility. I would hope that if there's major issues that come up, like when the central skills discussion came up about waiving it, that actually comes to the board and we are asked whether we want to take a position because PPS kind of sat that one out and it seemed like we may have wanted to take a position on it. So I guess I'm just going to go back to the legislative agenda. I hope things major things that come up that aren't on the legislative agenda that we might have an opinion about as a board that get brought back to the board because the Essential Skills was something that we just didn't even weigh in on and maybe we would decide not to take a position, but I think maybe I.

start time: 1985:37:00.000
end time: 1986:58:40.000
confidence: 0.97
E: So we are doing a local assessment this year that was part of what was noted in.

start time: 1987:26:30.000
end time: 1988:11:42.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Is that different from the Essential Skills?

start time: 1988:14:06.000
end time: 1991:45:02.000
confidence: 0.98
E: It's different, but I guess it's our localized way of measuring. Right. So while the waiver would be in place, we are taking local measures and that's why we made the notation that.

start time: 1991:45:26.000
end time: 1992:20:10.000
confidence: 0.95
C: That is happening Starting this year.

Big, thorough report. Yeah. All right, next, we're moving on to our budget calendar review. Dr. Armstrong, could you introduce us as well?

A: Good evening, board members. Thank you for your time on this busy agenda. This is maybe a little hard to believe, but. But it's time to start the process again for the budget development cycle. So tonight you have our draft budget calendar for the fiscal year 202526 budget. And I'm guessing that most of you will recall that last fall around this time we presented a similar looking document. And this is for discussion and this will be back before you for adoption at your November 6th meeting. So in most respects, this draft calendar pretty closely resembles the rough dates for the key events in the spring and then just mapping backwards to the engagement processes, including this fall. But just to highlight, there are several steps to the process, including community engagement. If you recall, we had a challenging set of circumstances last year with. I'll just say it was tough to have a lot of engagement, including with the board in the fall, just given everything else that was going on. So we're hoping that we'll be able to create some more time. You'll see that there are some references to school board work sessions on the budget in December and then January through March and then in April. Per our draft calendar, on April 22nd would be the presentation by the superintendent of the 2526 proposed budget. That would precede an approval on May 20th of next year and then official adoption on June 10th. And along the way, there are lots of opportunities for discussion, more community engagement, and ultimately the official filing with the TSCC as well. So there's a staff memo that's also included in your materials. It doesn't say a ton of additional details, but basically just recaps the main reasons why we're proposing this at this time. And a lot of those have to do with best practices. If you have any questions or feedback tonight, we're listening attentively and otherwise we'll Bring this back for. For your consideration on November 6th.

A: My question is if you could explain more about what the community engagement events would look like.

start time: 2067:44:00.000
end time: 2081:10:00.000
confidence: 0.95
D: May I jump in on that one? Only because I understand that this calendar represents board engagement. We will have a robust community engagement communication plan to go along with this. So I imagine putting out videos, having some zoom zoom sessions where we are actively sharing with the community our current state. And hopefully that leads to a call to action for folks to join us in Salem to advocate for funding. And so there will be a detailed communication plan that is directed towards our families and our staff. But this outline is more directed towards the board.

start time: 2081:40:20.000
end time: 2092:20:22.000
confidence: 0.95
A: Thank you, Dr. Armstrong. And if I can mention one other thing which I meant to say before, this is also, we're seeking to incorporate and integrate the community engagement processes for this overall budget, along with the required elements of community engagement and stakeholder engagement for our integrated grant processes. So those two, hopefully, instead of having separate processes, because those are required as well, we will have a harmonized approach. And some of those elements do have.

confidence: 0.96
D: Yeah, I appreciate that. And then I just want to take an opportunity. Opportunity. I know in my superintendent's report, I talked about meeting with core enrichment teachers. And I just want to resurface that and emphasize that when we make, and I know you all know this, but when we make budget decisions based on our resources and the way that we allocate, there are real consequences and sometimes unintended. There are surprises that happen on the school. School site. And so one of the ways that we look to counter that and get in front of that is to engage often and to be as clear as we can in our current state and the things that we're looking for in getting feedback, we don't want to make decisions in isolation. We want to bring in feedback. And, you know, at the end of the day, we need to make sure that we deliver a balanced budget, but we also want to make sure that. That it's informed and that stakeholders feel our families and our community feel like they were included and involved in the process and that it wasn't a surprise. And I think when I talk about priority two, about trust in relationships, I think it starts there, right? Can we do what we said we would do and make sure that community and families, not meaning that they're going to get all things, will go their way, but they'll be informed and they'll know the process and they'll know where to go to get more information.

C: So I have a couple feedback on the timeline. So early this fall. I think it would be useful for there to be either brief materials or as part of one of these meetings, information provided on what happened with the equity funding reduction. Because there's a lot of questions in the community. And even though I looked through all the materials you sent me, I still don't see when it went to 8 to 4%. So we've got lots of community discussion, like what happened. And then because this is a change sort of where we are with the Fund for pps and then have two. Two big items like additions to the calendar is January to March 2025, that there be a board whenever either a board meeting or a work session around the time when the staffing gets released to the schools. So a briefing on the staffing manuals. What sort of assumptions are being made in terms of distributing staffing? It's just 85% of the budget is going out the door at that time. Of course, during the budget process, we ratify it, but it really, when it gets sent out to schools is the time in which we start hearing from people and just understanding what assumptions are being made in terms of school based staffing so that we're not hearing it from the community and that we have accurate information provided to schools. And then the other thing that's not on here is every year already is like, you know, we have basically a month and three meetings between the proposed budget and they approve. All through meetings, including the meeting, we approve it. It's just barely over. Well, just barely under a month this time. But that we have a commitment that we get the budget at least in advance of the. I think last year was like we got it two weeks or 12 days before it actually got presented. So we have an opportunity to look through the state budget. But I think we got it like the 12 days before, which was super helpful because then we weren't looking at a stack. Our first one of only four meetings we were going to have on the budget. So that would just be another request with the terms of the calendar.

Just a reminder, we will be voting on the final budget calendar on November on our November 6th board meeting. Thank you. Chiefly Dr. Proctor. All right, moving on to the general obligation bond discussion. So Dr. Armstrong, could you. Would you like to share some stuff before we start this discussion?

D: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you, Chair and board. So we are very fortunate to have a community that continues to show up and support our students. You know, most recently we saw that in the local option levy that was passed in May. And now we have another opportunity to our community for help. And I know that we have lots of capital needs across our system. I love Director Scott's words about the trade offs and the reality that many of our buildings face during storms. We have to be able to be aggressive with creating a plan where we have safe schools in classrooms with environments that support every single one of our learners across the city. Even with all of those capital needs. I understand that we had a commitment to build our last three high schools, so Ida B. Wells, Cleveland and Jefferson, Jefferson being the next one and then Ida B. Wells in Cleveland. And so as we face the amount of need that we face with elementary and middle schools, I hope that we remain focused on our long term goals. And that's bringing all of our facilities up to standard in environments that our students deserve, not just when they get to high school, but when they start with us in kindergarten or preschool. And so I want to thank you all for your commitment to our physical buildings and I appreciate you for acknowledging the trade offs that are difficult and that you have to grapple with. So I just wanted to publicly announce that and just say how thankful I am that this conversation is moving forward and we have work to do and I look forward to us moving on that work as soon as we possibly can.

Director Scott, you scheduled a policy committee meeting on October 21st at 6pm immediately following the Policy Committee meeting. So it'll be a nice, exciting, exciting, eventful day. Dr. Scott, I don't know if you want to say a few words about that or. No, thanks. Chair Wong.

Well, although I wasn't here at the time, it is my understanding that the last time that this board discussed the bond was in June of 2024. And at that time, as I understand, the conversation was talking about the myriad of needs in our district and even upwards of $3 billion was the conversation. Since then, your staff here at the district have been very busy exploring many options, including some of the things that Director Scott talked about. The size of the bond, the timing of the bond, and the items to be included in that bond. And I know you all know that there are pros and cons to all of these options and there's many considerations that you're all going to have to make. But we here or, and Your staff here is in strong support of moving this conversation forward and we will fully participate in the School Facilities Improvement Oversight Committee, which is actually the name of it. It's that long, that important.

B: I don't have any questions yet. I'm not sure if I'm going to be back for that conversation, so I'm going to just say what's on my mind now. You know, I know there's this conversation around what previous boards committed to our promise, the community, about the schools. And I've said this before, and I'm gonna say it again, you know, there, that's very bad governance when one board obligates future boards to any kind of decisions. Not looking at the things that we might need to pivot needs change as well. And so while I understand that there is this wanting to finish the high schools, I just, hopefully we really look at all of our schools, especially with the changes when climate disruptions, things like that that's coming up, that we really start looking at prioritizing not just maybe two schools, but maybe prioritizing potentially 15 or 10 or 15 schools. You know, because when we talk about priorities, we talk about, you know, and Andrew talked about this earlier, know we have trade offs, you know, and you know, one of the things he made a comment he made to the parents was, well, if we take three, three teachers, you know, how would that, how would you know that? How you wouldn't like that as well? Well, I'm gonna say the same thing to us. You know, are we talking about two, two high schools? Are we talking about a potentially 10 to 15 high schools we can get done or are we retrofitted? Those are the areas that we are in now. These are the times that we're in now. I don't know what, what decision making process was done when they talked about doing all the high schools, as I was not on the board at that time. So, and I'm, to be honest, I don't feel obligated to that because I was not here for That I think our community are looking at all the demands and all the needs our facilities has at this point. And I, from the conversations that I've had, their conversations is not just about two schools. Their conversations about their elementary schools in their neighborhood, their middle schools in their neighborhood as well. And I don't know if they want to wait 10, 20, 30 years for that to happen. So I just hope during these conversations that we really start looking at how much we can get done versus, you know, some, some promises that was made and not that promises, you know, don't need to happen. But I think sometimes we might need to pivot on some of those and look at where we are now and where we are, where we're trying to get to. So I'm just put that out there. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it to the meeting on the 21st. So I just thought I'd give my thoughts out there about that now also, one of my thoughts is too. I'm sorry, I got one more thought. When we say we have a budget and when we stick to that budget, if we say a school is going to be this amount, then we stick to that school amount. When we talk about educational standards, it's not the word, I can't remember the word we use. When we talk about what a school needs. Aspects, right. We make sure we are being fluid and looking at where we're at and looking at where we're going. You know, I heard a comment today that this district was built for 70,000 kids. Well, we have 44,000 kids and it looked like it's going down according to PCC's birth rates and all those things. So while we were at 70,000 kids, we have to pivot to 44. If we're going to be losing other kids, we might have to look at or revisit those aspects, right? You know, to look for where we at now and where those 10 to 15 years year projections are going to be at. Because we have such a big school district, we have room if population increases, we have room to spread out if need be. So I just once again just talk about if we're going to do stuff, we're going to have a budget. We still have to try to stick to that budget as much as possible. If we can't, then we need to really look at what trade offs we're going to have or not have. And we might have to relook at everything to make sure we're staying under budget or staying close to what we're saying stuff costs. Because as a taxpayer, I'm gonna tell you, I get frustrated when we have to go back out to bond after bond for the same thing. We had to do that with Benson. We had to do that. It looks almost like we have to do that with Jeff. And that's frustrating. When I go look at my property tax bills every. Every November and seeing that, well, shoot, they didn't have that much money here. Well, now they got to do it again. That's not a good practice. So how we look at that at these meetings. Thank you.

A: Yeah, thank you, Director Holland, for mentioning that. I think it's to kind of reinforce your point. I think it's always important to, you know, as stewards of public money, we always look at what's going to. I mean, our money is limited. The money that comes in, PPS limited. And it's always important to look at making sure that we're maximizing the benefit to our students and whether we decide to go with the high schools or, you know, it's. But it's also important to look at the options to be like, you know, this is what that money could have been used for and how many more students could have helped. And I think that also helps transparency with the public when they understand that, you know, money is limited. These are the options on the table. We could go there, but these are the, these are the things, the trade offs. Or we could go the other way, and these are the trade offs. So I think either way, whatever direction we go, I think it's important to present what those trade offs are. So thank you, Director Scott. Yeah, thanks, Chairwoman.

H: Yeah, Gary. I would just say. Or sorry, Chair, Board member, Director Hollins, feel free to send if you're not able to. Any comments or thoughts in addition to what you shared tonight would be really helpful for that committee meeting. I did just a couple of notes. I completely agree with you about doing what we can to stick to scope, schedule, and budget. I guess one of the things I just want to react to and sort of just put for all of us to consider is that sometimes we miss those things because of construction inflation or construction delays or other things. But other times we. Those. Those cost estimates change because of board decisions. And I just want to be really clear. I mean, one of the reasons Jefferson's costs have increased dramatically is because we as a board gave direction to staff not to move those students. And so that was a decision that this board made that said we don't want to. We don't want to make these Students go across town for high school, and so we want to keep them on site that significantly increase the cost. So I just want to be. When we say stick to budget amounts, like, that's also on us as a board to make sure that we're taking that into account and that when we make those decisions, we're being really clear, like, yeah, we made this decision to respond to community input, but there's a huge increase in cost as a result of that, and there are trade offs as a result of that. The other thing I want to come back to is, you know, I just want to be really clear. You talk talked about, about sort of bad governance around obligating future boards. And I guess I just want to make sure it's really clear. Prior boards did not obligate current boards to do anything. So what prior boards did was they laid out a plan and they said, here's the plan that we think the district should do with bonds. This board has the ability to do anything they want. One of the reasons, though, why they laid out a plan to do the high schools was because it would benefit the, the most students. And so the idea was that we have a lot of facilities, needs in the district. By doing the high schools, you're going to benefit every student. Once you finish them, you'll benefit every student. Even if they're in an old grade school, an old middle school, they're going to go to a modernized, you know, high school. And that was the reason for it. And when that vision was laid out, there were priority decisions made about which high schools went first, which high schools went later. There were some changes. And I think what I want to be really cautious about is that communities such as Wells, communities such as Cleveland, strongly supported prior bonds and supported them at the ballot box, supported them through donations, supported them through fundraisers, through getting out there and saying, like, this is important to the district because they assumed we're going to get our high school as well. And so that's, for me, I don't feel obligated by a prior board to do this. We can make our own decisions. I think it was a good plan, and it's a plan that I want to see continue forward. And that's really the conversation that frankly, this board should have transparently. I would be very, very nervous about moving away from that because I think, you know, it was a good plan to begin with. I think we should stick with it. I don't disagree with you at all about all of those needs. I do think, you know, spending a lot of money on a middle school or a grade school that serves 300 or 400 students or 500 or 600 students versus redoing a high school that serves 16 or 17 or 1800 students. We do need to think about that impact. And I also want to say from a climate perspective, from a facility perspective, you know, Ida B. Wells is one of the schools that we had to shut down during the early heat wave because they do not have air conditioning, because they do not have a modern building, because it gets to 90 plus degrees in some of those classrooms. So this is focused on those exact things that you talk about. But the other reality is we have a massive backlog and this next bond is not going to fix it. And what we need to do, what I want to do, is continue this bond program, continue to do it effectively, continue to spend our money wisely, continue to show the results so that future voters and future board members will say, yeah, we can go back out to the voters again, we can get future bonds, we can make a change. It's going to take decades and I know that it's really frustrating for everyone to hear, but it also took decades.

C: I'm just going to follow on Director Scott's comments. This is my fifth bond. I will be my confront and it's a little bit bittersweet because I had kids in PPS for 18 years and not one of them went into a modernized high school. They did go into schools though that investments had been made in seismic and also safety investments, accessibility investments. So while I would have loved for my kids to have gone through a modern, a really cool modernized high school, it just didn't happen in 95 to when my kids graduated. But they did benefit from the other bond investments and I'm very appreciative of some of the tech investments as well. And having said that, while it's bittersweet, I think this is a pay it forward play for me, for others. Somebody built the schools that I'm looking here. Director Scott, Director Hollins, Director DePass and I all went to here in PPS and we continue to pay it forward even if we're not a direct beneficiary. I'm very supportive of finishing the plan to modernize all the high schools. Just like as Director Scott said, having been at the table, especially in 2017, there was this mad scramble to like everybody wanted to be in the bond because they were afraid that what would happen is the last high schools would not happen because people would forget there was this bigger plan. And so everybody, as people may recall, everybody was trying to get into that Bond, ended up 100 million short. And we then had to put part of Benson in the next bond. But I think our school communities knew when if you were in the Franklin neighborhood, you voted for the bond even though Franklin wasn't on it because you already had your. Your school modernized or you were in Cleveland or Lincoln or Ida B. Wells, and those communities worked on the bond campaigns, talked to their neighbors, voted for it, are paying the taxes, and yet weren't the beneficiaries. But it was because knowing that there was this larger strategy and plan. I also just want to note that both Jefferson and Cleveland are some of the, according to the facilities index, some of the worst buildings in the district, which is why in 2011, they were on the bond and the bond failed by about 900 votes, not because of what was in the package, but for other reasons. But they were in that initial package because they were among the oldest, most rundown, crumbling schools. And then when they got out of that, somehow they went to the back of the line. So. And this isn't to say that Wells is deserving. I think Wells is deserving to be renovated as well. It's a little bit newer, but I just want to note that the Cleveland and Jefferson community have been waiting. This will be almost. It'll be more than 15 years since they were supposed to move into being modernized. So I'm very supportive of the high schools, like finishing that off so that every student who goes through a high school will go through a modernized high school. Also in this mod package. I want to just talk about the importance of the investments that we're making in safe, warm, dry and accessible. We heard students tonight talk about student safety. We know that we still have work to do to have our buildings fully ada accessible. We want the roofs to hold the investments that help our buildings withstand extreme weather events. So having an increment of funds set aside for that work is really important to have that included in the common bond. I will say one thing that I know there's a lot of interest in. As we growing from Portland, there wasn't extreme weather. It was just sort of maybe a couple of days in August, it got to be 100, but it was really rare, and now it's less rare. And Looking at how we can use the funds that we receive from the clean energy fund already, and then we have another increment in like how those funds we have an agreement with Pat to address the heat and the cold. But you know, how we can creatively use some of these other funds to make investments that complement our bond, investments that help some of our schools, especially those that are sleep born to weather extremes, to ensure that we have the building systems, even if they're not going to be modernized for a while. So I think we have some other things we can do in addition to that. So I'm super excited the conversation is starting. I think we're getting started a little bit late, but we could just pick up the pace. And with us through and speaking of picking up the pace, Liz, what is the referral date that we'd have to have the referral done?

But I will say that the team and I did talk about other options and should there be other recommendations that we would make. And so I think when it came down to thinking about our high schools, just being clear that, you know, from the previous bonds we received an allocation of funds to do site plans and things. And so it cost us about $40,000 a day. Our construction firm gets about $150,000 a month in pre construction services. And so when we think of, you know, pivoting with funds that were already issued, I mean, we would stand to lose upwards of 20 million. I mean, for or you can do the math, right. $40,000 a day, every day that we're paused to explore other options. And so we wanted to be prudent with those funds. But I will say that we are interested and invested in continuing the conversation on how we can impact as many buildings as we can. But I just wanted to close that to connect some dollar signs to of the decision points. But go ahead, Dan.

I: Thank you. It's a good question, Director Beerman Everts, and it partially depends on what the findings are that come out of the analysis. So what this firm is going to do is look at actually four of.

A: Our projects and compare it to the Beaverton project and look at hard costs, look at soft costs, also look at market conditions, how those are different and.

start time: 2623:15:04.000
end time: 2638:18:38.000

I: Also cost controls, how we procure costs, how we evaluate costs, those sort of things. So it really will depend, I think, on what they find and how we might be able. There might be opportunities to make changes and other things. It might be more fixed. What I anticipate, I don't know, of course what I anticipate is that it's a pretty quick review. Getting apples to apples on different capital projects can get really complex. If you want to get real detailed, you're really going to look at a team of consultants, designers, professional cost estimators, contractors as well. But the hope is that they're able to identify at least a handful of areas where there are deviations. Either say here's what appears to be why there's deviation or here's something you might want to investigate further. So it's hard to know how much time that might be, if there's lots of quick pivots or not great.

C: And so then the other, I think it would be great for us to have because a frequent question we get is like how come your high schools cost so much? And that leads me to Anderson that did Benson, that also has been selected for Jefferson. And I'm concerned because the school wasn't. All of our other projects have been relatively on time and on budget and I'm hearing that there may be significant cost overruns and their estimate for the Jefferson project is 400, what is it?

C: And I'm concerned that a firm that did not deliver and we still don't know what the full scope of it, but deliver Benson on budget, that we're about ready to enter into another project that looks very, very, you know, half a billion dollars for a high school, that's a stunning amount. And so I am going to be asking for, like, that we have more answers relating to, like, what happened with Benson. Are they carrying that forward into Jefferson and have we selected the right firm or how are we going to contain the costs for a school? I mean, both Cleveland and Wilson are going to be predicted to be lower costs. So we don't need to answer it tonight. But those are the questions I have on whether Anderson's the right firm to.

G: So trying to piggyback on some of this. I love the idea of having a conversation about what we're doing with some of our schools because as much as I agree that I want our kids in high school to have this experience and that people have been waiting, the thing that I kept writing down is that our kids are spending eight out of their 12 educational years in dilapidated buildings that are falling down every day, that are having heat problems in the summer and vice versa.

start time: 2683:12:28.000
end time: 2683:15:40.000
confidence: 0.52
A: Right.

start time: 2683:16:20.000
end time: 2748:45:58.000
confidence: 0.95
G: You know, it's too hot in the summer and it's too cold in the winter. And so they're spending a lot of time in these, these buildings, like eight out of the 12 years. But we keep telling them, you know, but when you get to high school, it's going to be great. So I'm interested in the conversation. It's not to say that we don't. We don't need to do them, because I agree that we should. I'm bound by, you know, swear to your own hurt and change is not. And so I'm bound by some of these rules that I have that for myself. I just think we need to have a discussion. I believe if we open up the table to have a conversation with our community involved, engaging the community to say, I understand that we were going to do this and your elementary kids and your middle school kids are suffering. And with mental health being the way that it is right now and suicide ideation being what it is right now and all these other things, I can compile a lot of different things. I want to create an environment that is inducive for all of our children, that when they come into a building, they walk into a building, they walk into a space that they believe that this space was intentionally designed for me to be here, that they want me to grow and they want me to be better. And so I don't know how we get that, though, with the limited amount of funding that we have. So I am open to, very open to having a conversation and a dialogue about this situation and bringing the community in to have them have some input on this and do they understand the trade offs? Bring in some of the students and let them talk about it. So do they really understand the trade offs? Again, it's not to say, it's not to say that we don't need to do these two schools because I do believe that we do. These families have been waiting for a long time and like all of you have said, they have been giving knowing that their turn was going to come and I would like to offer that we come back to them and say, I know that you've been waiting and I'd like to give you something else to consider. So they wait over options. That's the one thought on schools. The other thought was on, I'm so glad that you brought up, you brought up Jeff and I totally believe that we need to do Jeff. Everybody know that I want to get Jeff done. I didn't go to the school. I'm saying they're like the Roosevelt rivalry, you know, saying that's my. But it's still my community. Those is my kids, those is my families. I know the people that are in that, you know, that are going to the school. I know the people that would like to go to school, but they don't live in the area. I know this family, I know this community and I want to see us done right. My question is, do we have to seeming that things have gotten like we had a number set for Jeff, that this is what we're going to be doing, this is what's going to cost. And then these numbers keep going up, they keep going up. And now we're putting it off and saying that, you know, we're going to have to put a portion of chep into the next bond in order to get it right. And my question is, do we have to do that? If we control the budget, can we come back to the table and say, no, we want to build the school, this is what we want, this is what we want in our school and this is how much money you have to do it, do it or find someone else. So can we come back to the table seeming that all this other stuff has changed? Do we have to keep the current agreement that we have? Can we come back to the table and say or how do we come back to the table? Say I don't want to Anderson Construction. If you can do it for what was it? 325, 375. Whatever the number is, we give them the number. If you can do it for this, then I'm with you. If you're not, then I'm going to go back out to bid. I'm going to put out another rfp. I'm going to do whatever else we need to do. Because you didn't meet our number. I don't want to go to the table because then now they just keep coming back to saying you need to give me more money, you need to give me more money, you need to give me more money. No, this is how much we're going to give you. Anything you do above that you eat.

A: Yep. I just want to mention thank you for pointing those out. I have the same exact questions. Director Green and also Director Brigham Edwards in discussions with, with leadership. I believe those are also the topics that were are to be discussed during the facilities meeting. And then for the sake of time I just kind of want to move on because I do believe those issues that you brought up are one of many discussion or points during that facilities meeting. So I, and I think in the facilities meeting it's going to be more conducive to have that kind of discussion and really delve deep into the issues and the trade offs. So just for the sake of time, I just want to say that and kind of quickly move on. Really. Thank you. And really quick question because I mean.

C: We'Ve been waiting a long time to have this discussion so I think we should round it out. So Director Scott, I know a lot of people have been waiting for the restart. Do you think right now there's one committee meeting set that relatively shortly set up a cadence that the committee would have a series of meetings that would lead to like a target date for recommendation to the board. I'm just curious because again the pace is going to pick up and people are wondering how do they come engage? What, what's going to happen? Yeah, no, no, it's a great question.

start time: 2775:10:06.000

H: I think the purpose of this first meeting is to, is to really see what, what do we have agreement on, what do we still need to get agreement on and then what kind of what are the next steps to get there. So I mean I, you know, from a, it is going to move quickly. I mean I think realistically we want to refer this by the end of the year so that we can run a really robust campaign for next May. That leaves pretty limited amount of time. I'm happy to just from a procedural standpoint to find another date a couple weeks after this one. But I think we also need to talk a little bit about, you know, what is that? Are we going to have some, you know, some evening meetings where folks can react to what's in the bond? What kind of community engagement do we want to talk to the Budget advisor or Bond Advice Accountability Committee? So there are a couple different options we'll talk about on the 21st in terms of working through all of that.

start time: 2789:04:50.000
end time: 2801:15:50.000
confidence: 0.93
B: Quick question and then I'll be done. So I'm really looking forward to those conversations when we talk about this timing. And I'm just putting it out here because it seemed like when we did the levy, we had it seem like we had a lot more Runway time. If we're doing this with this bond, is the Runway time adequate or can that, can it be moved to like November to give us more time? It seems, seems like we have a lot of things to try to discuss with priorities, things like that. Is November like a time that some wouldn't get done? I mean, can we at least find out if there's a negatives and positive pros and cons if we do look at November?

F: Yes, Director Hollins, and that is a topic for discussion at the meeting on the 21st. And we will explain the pros and cons of why one of the recommendations from SEER staff is going to be a May bond. But again, the decision is yours. And there are some. There's no, like, yeah, that is definitely the go to. There's, there's trade offs with every one of these decisions that we're making. But I will say that, you know, I've run worked on a lot of campaigns. 1995 school bond campaign. Right here, baby. Yes, technology, computers, it was a new thing back then. So, yeah, I've worked on a lot of these. And I do know that while there's never enough time, you really want to, you want to have years to be.

Thank you. Thank you, both of you. Right, we're moving on to reports from our board committees. For the sake of time, I'm asking if you can keep it within a minute or two. Let's see.

So the first meeting will be Tuesday, October 29, from 5 to 6:30. And there's going to be quite a bit on that agenda, actually. Janice Hansen, the PPS's internal auditor, will provide an overview of the Office of Internal Performance Audit. And we're also going to review and discuss the Audit Committee's work plan for the 2425 school year. And Janice Hanson again will provide the Office of Internal Performance Audit's annual report and audit plan. And we'll be hearing from our Finance Department and the Office of Operations considerations on the corrective actions taken in response to external audit recommendations. And we'll also be discussing the request for proposal process related to contracted auditors. We need to make a request because we've had this auditor for 15 years and you're supposed to re ask every three to five years. So even if we keep the same on, we need to do another request. And I will provide the board summary of this meeting at our regularly scheduled meeting on November 6th. And I'd also just like to give our internal auditor, Janice, just some kudos for the time she spends and how much she's helped me understand.

It's just a fairly novel agreement that has some complexities that don't arise out of disagreement, but out of working through the structure and future events that haven't yet been identified. So it's just the documenting of that. And both sides have sophisticated law firms helping to put that into place. And I do think. I want to really emphasize that we are working well together to get that in place. And I do think it will be soon, but I hesitate to give you an exact date and not hit it.

That would be one thing. And the other is given it's October and we have our fall enrollment numbers. Be great.
