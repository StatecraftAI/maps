B: I just want to. Please, you know, if you need a. I'm doing wrong or walking through. This is my first time sharing committee, so I'll be stumbling a lot along the way. Just feel free to let me know. I don't really. Feedback is always welcome. Yeah. So thanks for all being here. I guess this is. We haven't had a student success committee in a few years. I was, you know, talking with, with a few of the educational leaders and stuff and board members and part of the goal as I envision it. Well, also this first meeting is also I want to hear from all of you about what you think, what kind of goals you want to also achieve. So what I'm going to say here is kind of preliminary and just, kind of, just the kind of preliminary vision of what we're doing. I guess ultimately part of the, the role of the committee is to. And probably not very often because it's probably like the culminating work is to oversee policy. If there's any new policy that we can recommend to the board in terms of like if there's things that need to be changed or removed even or added to help your work. Because you know, one of the things is I, I see us as a team, you all are the educational leaders, the experts in this. And so part of us is to help work with and figure out what we can do to help achieve our goals, which I think we're all pretty in alignment. So that's kind of like the big overarching picture of what I see this committee doing. The next part is also part of it is also just to monitor the progress where I see oversight monitor to make sure that we are meeting our metrics, how we can figure out if we're meeting our metrics and also if what we're doing is being effective or not. Now I know that things like this are maybe multi year things. So we may not be able to figure everything out and that's totally fine. But I think where I think the big picture of this idea, the oversight monitoring is that if there's work to be done in the future because of things that we've uncovered this year, we can start getting ready for that and set us up for success next school year. For example. One thing is, for example, and hopefully we don't have to ever come to this. But one thing, for example is if we having issues with boundaries or school populations that need to be revisited, something like that, maybe we need to set up again. This is not something, I'm just throwing something random out there. This is not what I see. Hopefully it's not an issue and yeah. And so that's kind of where we're at. And then I also want to hear from hopefully all of you to see if there's anything you want to add. So I guess this kind of start from our pre meeting session. We came up with some ideas and let me know what things that you want or think you want to add or even remove. So a couple ideas that we had are. Sorry, I'm looking at the wrong. Yeah, a couple ideas we had were you know the stuff that was on this year so over monitoring the middle school redesign the progress and curriculum adaptation. One big thing that we might want to visit also graduation requirements for high school. That that's not necessarily something that we. I mean it could be but it's something I just want to talk and have an ongoing conversation. And then also monitoring and kind of overseeing the science of reading. Still early for me. Tend to be a night person so anything before noon lunchtime I'm usually bumbling my way through and. Yeah. Am I forgetting everything? Oh yeah. Things that I personally would like to also make sure that we kind of oversee is just kind of the course offering equity with all our middle schools especially in lieu of all the boundary changes. Yeah. And then also just the implementation of the work that you're doing and how we can kind of help or monitor or help suggest, you know just oversee. Right. So I'll kind of open it up to kind of other topics that other people would like to talk upon. Yeah a lot of ideas here hopefully to get us started thinking.

G: Thank you. One of the things that I like to see us looking into as part of this, the student success Committee. As we start thinking about what the. What is going to help all of our students be successful would be to have we considered like ROTC and JRLTC programs and the curriculum that they offered. I've spoken with with a couple with a few different people as well as some students to see if there's. See where the interest at. The interest came as a result of some of the students at Roosevelt High School. And I didn't know enough about it so I started looking into it. I've checked with Oregon City, I've spoken with the mayor of of Washington, well Vancouver about their stuff and I'm just looking around to see how. How this can help our graduation rate and get more kids access to things that are going to help them to be successful. Understanding that it's not. It's probably not best for everybody but for the ones that it is good for. I want to make sure that we, that we give them an offering if we can.

So that could be a huge part of that as well. That kind of discussion like that some other ideas that kind of kind of piggybacking off what Director Green mentioned. You also not only just looking at graduation requirements but also like we're talking about multiple pathways like CT programs. Right. Highlight the portrait of a graduate. What do we mean by that and how is it implemented? I should say also things I would also like to learn more about is like our Indian Ed program. Right. And just kind of see how. How best we can support these programs. Right. Especially looking at populations that have historically been less successful than we would like. Right. Great.

We're talking about middle school science reading and high school graduation. Just kind of overseeing population trends, making sure we. We just keep a close eye on that middle school redesign. And we're looking at multiple pathways to graduation, including the great things that director Green also mentioned as well. Yeah, I think that's pretty much. That's what I got. Right. All right. Seems like a huge workload for the year. Thanks for y'all for being here. If there's nothing else, I guess we can move on to the next agenda item, which is the. Which I don't have in front of me. The middle school design. Great.

E: Well, good morning again. I'm Joanna Tobin, senior director for middle grades for academics and redesign. And thank you so much for the invitation to speak on these topics and to share our work with you and our next steps overview here. We'd like to share the wonderful work from Dr. Armstrong's team, which is a guidebook. And a lot of this work sits within that guidebook. So we'll share that with you today. We'd like to give you the brochure, huge labor of love here. Our middle grades redesign brochure give an overview of core academics and implementation. And then I'll pass to Philippe to. We will speak on those high school graduation requirements and give a high level overview there. Centering our board goals for 8th grade readiness and high school graduation is really the work of this team and what we're aiming to do. I'll just share very briefly. Of course, this is not a presentation on data. However, our trends really are trending in the right direction. And so I'll touch on that as we go through the core areas and what we're seeing there a bit more. Let's start though with this guidebook. I'll pass this around. And as mentioned, the talks that we're touching on today are included in this guidebook. Again on Dr. Armstrong's behalf. This is really a compilation of multiple departments and really aiming to have one central location for board members, community educators, families, to be able to see a high level overview of all of what we are working on and providing for our students in gps. So the future now a collective, a teaching and learning collective. For those who are online. There's a URL code or there's a code there and also a link and hard copies are available at the district office. So centering our middle grades. When we talk about middle grades, we talk about middle grades, core academics and redesign. We really are talking about both our comprehensive middle schools and our K8 schools. So of course our K8s include 6th through 8th grade students. And so oftentimes we get that question, does middle school redesign include just comprehensives or K8? So we just want to make that really clear. This is from page 8 of the Middle grades brochure. So just really highlighting all of the schools that we serve within redesign and within core academics. So with that, next we will pass out this just tremendous body of work with PPS staff and community and leaning on the research in middle grades. Nationwide research, definitely a labor of love. The last page highlights many of the staff that were involved in this process and of course many more. And so I just want to say in gratitude to everyone who has worked on this before, I pass it over to Director of Middle Grade Design Richard Smith. Just wanted to say thank you to all who are involved, our community and our staff and many schools who were represented in the construction of this. Over to you.

A: So this is our middle grades redesign plan. It's been a work in progress over the last couple years and there's been a lot of different committees that have gotten together with a lot of feedback from parents, from students, from principals about what should go in here as well as research. So we have a middle grades website that has the brochure linked. That's what's presented up there. And I'll just Briefly kind of go through what this packet has on the first page. It has our foundations, our mission, our vision and the guiding values as we went through this. And then on page two on the introductions, just kind of a brief overview of some of the processes that happened to get to the point where we are today and why we engaged in this work. Page three goes through the timeline of what's happened with middle grades redesign over the last few years and how we got to where we are today in August of 2023. And it was definitely a work in progress to get there. Though I'm new in the role, I was also involved in this process, so I was able to follow along as we went through it. And then the themes are important on page four because these themes is where our buckets of work lie for what we're trying to do with our middle grades redesign. You can see what's in bold right there is what's going to be talked about quite a bit in the initiatives coming up. Those are inclusive and differentiated teaching and learning, embracing change, racial equity and social justice, professional excellence and support, and integrated adolescent supports. As we go to page five, I just want to highlight real quickly there how we got to these items. It was on current research, which is referenced at the back of the packet, Best practices from other institutions. So we saw what was happening elsewhere. And then guidance from our association for Middle Level Education, which is a group that we partner with, survey feedback and then expertise from the different offices here at central office. And so on page six, seven and eight, that is where you can see those five items and what initiatives fall under each of those. I won't go through every single one of them right now because there's 18 of them and it sounds quite a bit, but these are very closely tied together, these 18 initiatives and you can't really do one without the other. Many of these are ongoing in our school currently and I want to hone in specifically. For example, what's already happening in schools right now is like Initiative 4, provide comprehensive social, emotional and mental health services. We've increased our counselor to students student. We've lowered that threshold at our schools. We have different supports in the schools for that and different partnerships including upcoming with the Ballmer. So those are things that are ongoing when you look at Initiative 5, implement Engaging Grade level and standards aligned curriculum. That's also happening in our school with the curriculum adoption. So skipping over to page 9 and 10 really hones into how the plan unfolds into our school. And so I'm going to scroll down to that. So on page 10, the plan for 23, 20 years, 2023 through 2026, there's eight ongoing that are currently ongoing at the top. And then the simultaneous initiatives is what I wanted to spend just a couple minutes on today. And then the year to year is what's going to happen down the line a little bit.

B: So.

A: The five key plans for this school year, the simultaneous initiatives that all K8s and 6 8s are going to be working on is providing all middle grade students with access to advisory programs. So schools last year got to adopt a specific curriculum and built an advisory to their schedule. So all schools this year will be doing advisory and we'll be monitoring what that looks like and how that works with students feeling an increased sense of belonging in their schools. We also had our best schools craft innovative schedules with more opportunities for enrichment, with more opportunities for access to grade level curriculum and more access to different electives and access to advisory. And so those schedules reflect that for this upcoming year. One that we're working on in process is standardizing our 8th grade field trips and capstones. We know that those experiences widely vary across our district. And so we're partnering with principals and finding out how to standardize those in a culminating capstone. And we have some great ideas around how that looks like from sixth to eighth grade. When we think about sixth grade outdoor school, that's a really cool opportunity all of our students currently engage in. And then we're exploring how to provide additional opportunities in seventh and eighth grade that students would then carry forth until the end of their eighth grade year for a capstone and presentation, then fully implementing a restorative justice framework. This year, all K8s and 6 8s have been provided with a restorative justice coordinator. And so thank you for providing that funding for our schools. And so we're partnering with the schools to get that framework up and running to lower disparity and discipline to help students feel a better sense of belonging and ownership in their schools. And then finally implementing interdisciplinary 8th grade success teams. This is going to be where we help that transition from 8th to 9th grade with all of our students to be able to build that bridge. We have pretty good bridges from fifth to sixth, but eighth to ninth, we're seeing that we're losing some kiddos there. So we want to build that bridge deeper in. So those are the five core simultaneous initiatives that this year we'll be working through with principals and their staff. And then finally, this is just kind of an overview of how that's currently happening. You know, we have some more campus safety associates. We have the restorative justice professional learning and then the core counseling crew, which is with the advisory programs going on in the school. And so this year we're also gonna be partnering with principals on the last five initiatives to see how we roll that out over the three years. And those will be campus specific plans over the next three years. That's a bit about middle grades redesign.

E: Just to add a little bit more to the advisory programs. This is a partnership with the T Cell department. They have been working on the adoption for a few years now. And so we really gave, as Richard said, we gave school leaders that opportunity to engage with the community around selection of one or two different options. Wayfinder. And we do it for the culture. And so this is also really touching on, as Richard said, all of these initiatives are really interdependent and rely upon one another. And so we do have on our website, we have links for our teachers, our teachers this Thursday on all of our middle school teachers will be trained in the curriculum that their school selected. And so that was really a big undertaking. Making these shifts in our large, wonderful district takes a lot of intentionality and time with our teachers that they have that preparation heading into that opportunity to implement and launch these advisory programs. And so I want to also elevate that as a real cross departmental work and elevate Jill Bryant and that TESOL department for their work. It was a wonderful way for us to hold hands on this implementation for our students.

E: Transformative social, emotional learning. Thank you. Yes. So that is happening and that's really exciting to elevate. And we look forward to as you opened with the asks or what to move forward. And these schedule pieces, we have some really great pieces in place. We were planning to look last year what we was needed to make space for advisory within our schedules. That happened. We have some next steps that we also want to implement to make more room for all of these 18 initiatives. And so as these are our simultaneous initiatives that we're really elevating this year. Again, there's a lot of interplay with all of them as Richard shared.

C: You having to cut out?

start time: 400:59:56.000
end time: 412:48:00.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yes, I know it's always hard. So currently many of our schools are on what's Called a five of seven period. So they have students have access to seven different classes. Some of our schools throughout the district still are on a six period day. So there are differences. And in here on page. We can put you to page 12 that gives a little bit more of an overview of that. So our scheduling work this year really looked at how do we maximize within our current contractual. Within our current constraints, which really we are. We are really in this construct of some schools having the opportunity for five of seven and some being on a six period. When we say five of seven teachers teach five of the seven periods, but.

start time: 412:48:40.000
end time: 414:07:40.000
confidence: 0.84
C: Students have access to six, two additional periods or.

start time: 414:23:40.000
end time: 426:24:32.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yes. And so with that six period teachers teach five of six periods. And so what we're really striving to do is to provide more opportunities for our students. Ultimately everyone having access to that seven period day. We also have a hybrid. Two of our schools have the hybrid in place already. So that being George Middle School and Oakley Green have some variation of a hybrid schedule. Which what that means is the periods aren't identical on every single single day. And so they have a longer period within the week for their advisory that's been in place for some time and has been working well for them. Some of our schools did already have advisory programs in place prior to this year, but they weren't standardized with that social emotional learning that the district's providing.

start time: 426:25:36.000

E: Yes, oftentimes. Yes. And so we've really moved to a more consistent three times a week. And schools are approaching that a little bit differently which we gave room for this year as we launch and we'll look at that data gives us an opportunity to see what's really working well.

C: So with the five of seven, you know, we're able to add time into student schedule so that we don't have to take any. It might have been a study hall. Well, it was intentional to build a five or seven so that we could add more lectures. What we found initially was that there was limitation with the six period schedule of what electives and how many electives students could opt into. But then with the middle school redesign, looking at how we could build other intentional programming like advisory and the T cell. So if you have seven instead of six, you've got shorter periods.

start time: 443:33:00.000
end time: 444:28:04.000
confidence: 0.99
E: You actually have longer periods on a six period.

B: But.

confidence: 0.97
E: But fewer opportunities. And this will become increasingly important for us to navigate and get your help funding wise as we really elevate PE requirements. Because one of the pieces. So again the interplay. So we talk About PE for a moment. Our PE requirements are increasing and our schedules need to support that access for students on the sixth period. It is very, very challenging to make that happen.

B: Reese, just kind of clarify really quick. Is the move trying to push towards all schools to be five of seven or is it their choice?

start time: 453:37:36.000
end time: 453:59:28.000
confidence: 0.91
A: Okay, that would be the hope.

start time: 454:00:24.000
end time: 456:33:00.000
confidence: 0.88
B: Yes, the hope. And currently there are 10 of the 15, 10 of the seven. Okay. And what's, what are the barriers for the, the rest of the five?

start time: 457:02:00.000
end time: 459:47:32.000
confidence: 0.97
E: It does require an increase of staffing and that is. We know those numbers and we are hoping to realize that for all schools.

start time: 459:48:36.000

B: Okay.

start time: 459:55:32.000
end time: 465:22:44.000
confidence: 0.93
C: And we have been able to over time increase the 5 of 7 just in the past two years. Yes, I'm not sure. I don't recall where it was prior to the two years, but we're making instrumental progress because now we're at 10 or 15 schools where before. Margaret, you want to add? Yeah.

start time: 465:23:32.000
end time: 471:24:12.000
confidence: 0.89
D: So I think, you know, over time this is. So I appreciate the timeline in the front of this of the book here because part of as many of you know, we've gone from transitioning from primarily a K8 model back to a middle grades model. And as you're describing, Director Wang, when it was around, what are the course offerings?

start time: 471:25:16.000
end time: 471:29:48.000
confidence: 0.68
C: Right.

start time: 471:30:44.000
end time: 491:44:16.000
confidence: 0.94
D: So how do we have robust course offerings? What does that look like? How large, what's the student population you need to have with that? And then actually how do you provide interventions and support within the day as well as a robust programming? What does that look like in six periods versus seven? Sort of. Where is that flexibility? And I know that some of the, as we went through this transition and coming back to opening middle schools like Tubman was reopened and Roseway Heights was converted, you know, as we've gone through Harrison park this year, so, so as we've gone through Transitioning out of K8s back to middle schools, we've looked at what are the needs of the schools. And little by little, incrementally, as Dr. Proctor has stated, we've moved through how many schools are on a seven community day. And I'm trying to think, last year we, there were three additions, this year there's a fourth, so bringing us to 10. So in the last two years we've been able to add four schools into that seven period day. And the hope is to continue to do that as we move forward to have some consistency, as you're mentioning, about academic programming.

start time: 491:46:08.000
end time: 505:47:40.000
confidence: 0.94
C: And we do also keep an eye, just for the sake of equity, when you talk about middle school. We're looking at, yes, the standalone middle schools. But we also, if you listen in the language, we talk heavily about middle years because we want to ensure that even in the K8s, that we are intentional about the middle years experience for the students. So it encompasses all of our students in grades six to eight. We get the same opportunities and that's what we're striving towards. I was wondering, is it more than K8 where it's harder to get the seven periods? K8 is a little bit more challenging because yes, you have fewer kids students in K8 and because you have fewer kids in K8, it is harder to provide a more robust curriculum.

C: Absolutely, absolutely. So it's part of the work that SEGC tackled in order to get students to Kellogg, we had to take some K8 and make them K5 year.

end time: 513:14:26.000
confidence: 0.94
B: I don't want to, I definitely don't want to also underscore the importance of like all middle schools in particular having an advisory and being consistent with it. When you're talking about three times they're.

start time: 513:14:58.000
end time: 513:44:34.000
confidence: 0.92
A: Offered opportunities to be an advisory and.

start time: 513:44:42.000
end time: 533:56:50.000
confidence: 0.93
B: If you don't know what advisory is, advisory is opportunities where they can have conversations that they need to have that they maybe won't have in a line of charge math class where you can talk about definitely permanent things that are happening outside of school and how would it actually affects them in their daily life lives. And actually setting aside time to do that is extremely important and we've all known that. We've seen it across the country. Some of the coming back from pandemic, especially at the middle grades, how much of a struggle it's been. And so this opportunity at the middle levels got two questions. One is the, when you mentioned the 10 to 15 that are at 5 to 7, those are just the middle schools. Right, right. And then yeah, I guess the question was advisories. I have been in a few advisors, some that have been done well and some that haven't. So I'm just curious about what, what supports do we have in place in terms of like supporting how advising, you know, the transition to advisory. Because I know that, you know, a lot of teachers when they just throw advisory, like, oh, they don't know what to do. So what, what kind of supports do we have for our teachers?

start time: 534:02:30.000
end time: 549:00:00.000
confidence: 0.97
E: I mean, I think the biggest piece to elevate right now is the shared learning experience. So carving out that half day time coming up this Thursday and then we have some ongoing professional development throughout the year. We're in a learning pit with this. It's going to be a shift. Approximately 66% of our schools had some form of advisory and yet did not have a standardized curriculum in their hands. And so, you know, trade offs. I think that, you know, the access to this curriculum that has very strategic professional development with it will be a big support for our teachers. And I also don't want to be naive to the fact that it is a big shift. Right. So we will be in that learning and growing pit as we know, and listening to what our schools need. Some schools are leaning into it with a little bit of a softer start the first week or so and just grow, growing into that pacing off of their staff needs. Our principals are very in tune to what their teachers are needing right now.

A: I was going to say we've added in a person at each school lead that'll get eight hours of extended time to be able to help lead that work at each of the schools.

start time: 551:39:16.000
end time: 557:09:00.000
confidence: 0.92
B: There you go. Do we have any feedback in terms of like, you know, from students, from teachers, from the principals about how advisory is going in these implementations? I guess, I mean, in general, 507 as well.

start time: 557:22:00.000
end time: 565:56:30.000
confidence: 0.96
A: Having spoken with the K8 and middle grades principals, they express that they're excited to get up and running. They want to see how it goes. They've invited us in to come walk with them and see to evaluate how it's going. But they're excited about the curriculum. They think that they had a chance last year to review it and adopt it. And so overall, the general tone from building leaders is that they're really, you know, they're always a little bit nervous, of course, to roll something new out. But they're also really excited to have a standardized curriculum of one of these two across their schools.

start time: 566:16:50.000
end time: 586:20:50.000
confidence: 0.95
D: I think that. So there were a number of schools that have piloted. There are two different sort of entry points. I would say some schools develop their own sort of curriculum and kind of went through that process. Like Hosford is an example of a school that really had developed it over a number of years. And then there are other schools that went through the pilot process. So Beaumont's another example, the school that went through a pilot process. And thinking about when we talk about some really critical things around identity, community, connection, people, those are things that have surfaced from schools about and how students interact with each other and with peers. And also sort of one of those communal community agreements has been probably the things that I've heard most about what people see as positive. I think in concert with some of the work that we're doing around restorative practices. Like this is a space also where students can practice and there will be entry points for people to go in and. And do some school wide lessons to sort of set the tenor as well.

end time: 596:28:30.000
confidence: 0.98
E: Yeah. Actually in our design for this year, it is embedded within a class period. So looking at how we can pull this off is really does need to be connected to a class period for the teacher taking attendance. Some classes may end up with a co teaching situation. The majority will be one teacher within a class period. So it may be. Many of our schools are doing a first period. Also some are doing a midday opposite of lunch. So either that third period, fourth period.

confidence: 0.97
A: Oh yeah. I mean many of the K8s are really small too when you really think about it. And so some even only have like one section per grade level. So those kids travel together as they move up. At most you typically see two sections per grade level. And so it gives them a chance to build community with that group. And also we understand the limitations as well with sizes.

G: My question actually goes back to what we were just talking about prior to. As far as like we say we have 10 or 15. I'm looking to find out what is the budgetary impact to get all schools there to all. Because I'm sure the reason that we're at 10 or 15 has something to do with money. And so if we said we wanted to do it in all 15 schools, have we investigated what that budgetary impact would look like to find out even if it's feasible or what sacrifices would need to be made? Or is it best to just leave it how it sits? But what's the number.

start time: 628:17:40.000
end time: 632:34:14.000
confidence: 0.93
C: The team has investigated over the course of years? I'm going to turn it over to Margaret Calvert may not be able to pull a number out of her wonderful brain, but will give us some what we see in this trend as need.

start time: 632:37:02.000
end time: 632:43:34.000

B: Yeah.

start time: 632:44:22.000
end time: 634:55:50.000
confidence: 0.90
D: So I think there is an additional FTE requirement, Director Green, and I think that that is UBI 5 FTE. What's that?

start time: 634:56:30.000
end time: 635:17:42.000
confidence: 0.74
C: UBI 5 FTE.

start time: 635:20:06.000
end time: 641:10:44.000
confidence: 0.96
D: It is. I think I would like to come. I would like to come back with a more definitive number. But the biggest thing is that there's. There's an actual staffing implication and I think we have some analysis we've done and I'm happy to bring back the details of what the. How to get to the all 15 to that level. Happy to do that.

start time: 641:13:32.000
end time: 646:37:52.000
confidence: 0.94
C: So it would look like a range of FTE maybe somewhere between 5 and 10. 5 and 10, possibly. And then the average cost of one FTE is. Is it 150? 120. Approximately.

start time: 646:38:56.000
end time: 646:59:40.000
confidence: 0.96
B: At least 120.

start time: 647:14:00.000
end time: 652:25:30.000
confidence: 0.95
C: So we'll. So giving you those rough numbers is just to let you know that we have thought about it. We do have an idea of what it would be. And if we're going to present something, we want to take a little time to crunch the numbers better so we can give you a definitive dollar amount.

start time: 652:28:10.000
end time: 657:11:50.000
confidence: 0.96
G: Okay, I would love that. And then my thought, just to follow up with that, based on the numbers you just said, would this be additional fte, meaning that staff that we don't already have, or would this be giving somebody else a new job or something like that?

start time: 657:22:10.000
end time: 658:19:06.000
confidence: 0.98
C: It would be additional FTE staff we don't have.

start time: 658:21:38.000
end time: 659:30:40.000
confidence: 0.92
G: Okay, yeah. That's what I'm looking for. Right, that's what I'm looking for. We need new bodies.

start time: 659:32:50.000
end time: 659:44:40.000

E: Yes.

start time: 659:59:40.000
end time: 678:49:28.000
confidence: 0.97
C: So, and then to just piggyback on the PE question, we did make a proposal. We initiated some of our early budget conversations of how we were gonna spend down the additional dollars that we received from state funding. And we did make a proposal to the board. Part of the proposal was to add FTE for PE so that we can increase and be better in compliance with pe. And with that breakdown is going to be coming forward for the board's full consideration. I do want to add that the two go hand in hand. Right. So while we made a proposal for PE, it didn't address the 5 of 7, but by addressing the 5 of 7, we could potentially address both that and the PE. And I don't know if anyone wants to elaborate on what I'm trying to put out there.

start time: 678:51:44.000
end time: 690:59:30.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Yeah, sure, sure. I think just to add to that, our Goal. So it is really happening. PE requirements are increasing for 6, 8 ODE. We've had had a really long Runway and it multiplied a couple of times. I remember clear back in oh, 2026, as a middle school principal, this was happening and now it's here. So we really are making headway to arrive at 3/4 of PE for all of our middle grades by the 2025, 26 school year. And Odee has made it very clear that we have to make that happen. There are no more sort of progress updates around that. And so with that, as Dr. Proctor was saying, this goes hand in hand with our schedule work and our shifts and our increase around fte.

start time: 691:02:10.000
end time: 696:12:00.000
confidence: 0.97
C: And then with that, you know, with that proposal that's coming forward, there is some additional fte. So at this point right now, not all middle schools have PE programs.

start time: 696:23:00.000
end time: 699:26:52.000
confidence: 0.96
E: They have PE programs. They do not meet the full demand of the latest requirements around PE or the requirements set forth by ODE, which.

start time: 699:27:16.000
end time: 714:11:40.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Is 150 minutes per week average for the school year. Each chapter, 150 average per week for the year. So in the way it's designed now, as we were making progress towards it, we chunked it quarter at a time. So many schools are offering one full quarter of pe. We are proposing that schools increase to three quarters of pe and with the budgetary ask that will be coming forward to the board, that would bring us to better alignment. And, and so more information will come with the percentages of what percentage of schools would then be in compliance.

start time: 715:39:52.000

E: Just fly through these four academic slides here real quick? So great grounding in our vision and our purpose around middle grades, core academics again of course serving students in our comprehensive middle schools and our K8s to talk about math. We are now heading into our second year of our adoption which is mid school math. This rated very high on ed reports. It really is hands on, engaging real world math for sixth through eighth. And also we've embarked upon deep learning and reflection within our Kids 12 math system for how we meet middle grades learners situated within there our trend data right now. Again we're seeing some really positive results from from our math and wanting to stay the course. Also noting that we do have a conversation around our accelerated or some other opportunities within our system currently really looking at how we ensure that our students have great access to our grade level standards align math and that we still maintain pathways to more rigorous math courses as well. So there'll be more to come on that in the future. Over to science. We're now in our third year of implementation of the Science Education for Public Education program or CPAP as we refer to it. Again, this is also really hands on. When you walk into many of our science classes, you'll see students getting in there and doing experiments and really making meaning in partnership or in small groups. And it was really designed in alignment with the three dimensional areas for those next generation science standards. That's really the foundation for our science currently.

E: I'm really excited to share about our developments for social science for middle grades this year. This past year, K12 worked really really hard on the adoption process and it's challenging the standards. Currently we're in an off cycle. So ODE will be presenting new standards by 2026. And so the. The texts out there currently just did not beautifully align. But we found a really great pathway forward. Our error committee for six eight had been working really. It just was a great representation of our teachers. And we currently have. We had an edition of TCI History Alive. Our AIR committee landed on a recommendation for TCI and we were able to find a way to do a bridge until we reached those new standards to have our teachers access the latest editions for TCI History live for the teacher editions, the student editions. And we also really are excited about this new curriculum. Black history 365. That curriculum we are calling not a supplemental, we're calling it a complimentary program because it really goes really hand in hand with our seventh and eighth grade standards. The standards within black history through 65 do not touch as much on sixth grade. And so we did not order the text for sixth grade. We did for seventh and eighth. And so that's being rolled out currently and was a part of the teacher professional development in June and August. English Language Arts. This is our second year of an adoption. We partner with 912 as well on this. Both great bands adopted. Intro to Literature by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. So we call it HMH as it's referred to. And so this is a really rough, robust curriculum. We find that there are just many elements to it. And so as we live into the second year of the adoption, teachers are really getting in there and utilizing those pieces even more so. And with that, I can pause if there are any core academic questions before passing it to Philippe.

So this is our second year of implementation with the English language arts group, and we still brought out our vendors the second year still, again, using that implementation, that learning pit analogy. We still are really learning in that second year. And so we brought out our vendors both in June and this month and again for the new teacher session on Thursday. And so we're really lucky to have that resource within the bond funds supporting our deeply engaging curriculum. Also being that teacher development, teacher professional development piece.

F: What's exciting to hear about all the good work happening in middle schools as they prepare students for high school? And of course, our mission is to make sure there are high schoolers are ready for for college and career. So I'll talk briefly about some graduation requirements. We'll look at our most recent graduation data. We can take a quick look at the high school success plan. Feel free to stop. Me and Margaret will be able to answer and jump in as needed.

start time: 820:35:00.000
end time: 821:13:20.000
confidence: 0.80
B: All the questions. All the questions.

start time: 821:25:40.000
end time: 855:54:50.000
confidence: 0.97
F: So our high school graduation requirements. I'll do a quick overview and then talk about some details. So in order to graduate from PPS, high school, students need four years of English, three years of social studies, three years of math, three years of science, two years of world language, one year of fine or performing art or technical art, one year of health, one year of PE, and then six electives. So for a total of 24 credits, students earn half a credit per semester, so they earn a full credit over the course of a school year. Our students take eight classes typically, so over the course of four years, they can earn up to 32 credits. One thing to note is that our graduation requirements are considerably more rigorous than what the state requires. So, for example, in social studies, we're very specific to say that students need to take one year of US History, one year of modern world history, one year of government and econ. The state says that students just need three social studies credits, half a credit, which needs to be in civic education. When it comes to math, we require students to take at least Algebra 1, Algebra 2 and Geometry. The state simply says that students need three years of math above Algebra 1. With regards to science, we're specific to say all students have to take physics, chemistry and biology as opposed to the state requirement which says that students just need one year of lab science. The state does not require world language. We do two, two years and I think that's it. As far as the differences.

start time: 856:07:10.000
end time: 860:50:30.000
confidence: 0.91
B: The two years of world language coincide with the OUS system. In order to get into the OUS system, you need the two years coincide with what? The Oregon University system. So Novo, Oregon State, Eastern Oregon. And so they require minimum two years. So it makes sense, right?

start time: 860:52:30.000
end time: 861:05:30.000
confidence: 0.76
C: Yeah.

start time: 861:51:10.000
end time: 886:17:30.000
confidence: 0.96
F: So if we look at the next slide, when we look at how our graduation rates compare to the state, it's exciting to see that we're performing considerably better than the state. And I think that's especially impressive considering that our requirements are more. More rigorous. If we look at the next slide, we want to understand the big picture. We also want to understand how our different student populations performing. On the left hand side you can see the four year cohort graduation rate. So that is the percent of students who started in ninth grade who graduated four years later. Then on the right you can see the fifth or the five year cohort completion rate. So that's percent of students who also graduated after the additional year. We were excited to be outperforming the state. We're definitely concerned that not all of our students are performing as well as they as they could. We're seeing some modest gains over the last three years with the exception of our Latino students who were not seeing those gains. Let's go, let's skip the next slide and then just look at the high school success plan.

start time: 886:51:50.000
end time: 887:38:54.000
confidence: 0.82
B: So can we go back to the.

start time: 887:39:02.000
end time: 889:25:50.000
confidence: 0.92
D: Slides just real quick? Thanks. The other piece, I just want to say, I know we mentioned the multiple pathways to graduation.

start time: 889:28:30.000
end time: 889:33:50.000
confidence: 0.70
C: Right.

start time: 889:34:30.000
end time: 899:06:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: The other thing that we pay attention to is five year completer rates. So there are students that enter our system and it may take for a variety of reasons, slightly longer, but our commitment is to get students to complete. This is often the work of our multiple pathway schools which include not only our district alternatives that are contracted alternatives that we have with community based organizations. So we attend to both and it kind of looks at a complete picture of the system in that realm on both of us.

start time: 899:24:50.000
end time: 901:10:02.000
confidence: 0.97
C: Thank you for explaining that. So the fifth year side is certainly fewer students, right?

start time: 901:11:46.000
end time: 916:53:20.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Yes. Okay. So it would be. There are some students that continue. So some students may choose that they do not complete based on their entry year of high school. They may return to their high school and finish as a fifth year students. They may go to one of our district alternative school at alliance for example and they may only have part of a year to finish but they finish in that fifth year so they count in that next year's moment. Or they may be at one of our community based alternatives schools like Mount Scott, Rosemary Anderson, PYC north or through one of, through some of our programs with pcc for example. So it gives a sort of a holistic view of an entire class that comes in at a given year, sort of what their paths are to completion and, and getting to a diploma and, or to a ged.

start time: 917:28:20.000
end time: 918:51:08.000
confidence: 0.96
B: It's really quick, hopefully quick. So we just don't have the 202223.

B: January, yeah.

start time: 920:53:58.000
end time: 921:59:30.000

F: And we all eagerly await data.

start time: 922:09:50.000
end time: 922:55:50.000

D: The validation for graduation takes a while.

start time: 922:57:50.000
end time: 923:02:30.000
confidence: 0.88
C: Right.

start time: 923:03:10.000
end time: 925:11:34.000
confidence: 0.96
D: And to compile the data and so we work with ODE to do that. And it's usually a mid year so it lags by about six months from.

start time: 925:14:22.000
end time: 930:27:40.000
confidence: 0.90
C: And we have that scheduled for the full board every year. And sometimes in that fifth grade cohort you have your second language learners, your newcomers who need a little bit more time especially around language acquisition and your special needs students.

start time: 931:24:40.000
end time: 939:54:26.000
confidence: 0.92
F: I'm not sure if this level of details of interest, but if a student enrolls, let's say at Ida B. Wells High School as a freshman and they remain enrolled, if they graduate, they're part of our completion date. If they stop coming to school, they're considered part of our cohort as well. If the student transfers to Lincoln High School their sophomore year, they become part of Lincoln High School's cohort.

start time: 939:57:38.000
end time: 940:10:42.000
confidence: 0.55
B: Right.

start time: 940:13:46.000
end time: 952:25:50.000
confidence: 0.95
F: If they transfer to, if they move out of state and we lose track of them for some reason, they're still considered Ida B. Wells student. If Ida B. Wells gets a senior from another school district who's credit deficient as a senior, they become part of our cohort graduation rate. And so as Margaret mentioned that the validation process the state essentially needs to go through a process of accounting for all the students before they can finally say what the high school graduation rates. So it's certainly not number of kids who started as seniors and finish the seniors. It's much more intricate than that.

start time: 952:42:50.000
end time: 958:53:12.000
confidence: 0.96
D: So there's one more graduation that's going to happen for the class of 2023 as well and we hope that you guys have it on your calendar. So there are students that finish over the summer and we'll hold a graduation for them in the next coming in the upcoming weeks. And so we hope that you guys will be able to join us for that September 7th. Thank you.

start time: 958:56:16.000
end time: 959:40:20.000
confidence: 0.89
B: Thank you. You're in my mind. That's what I was going to say too.

end time: 977:32:12.000
confidence: 0.95
F: All right, so very briefly, PPS high schools, the principals and district leaders came together to create a plan for what are the things that all of our high schools are working towards in order to ensure college and career readiness. And so there are three kind of main buckets of work. One is around improving instruction and aligning assessment. It's very much aligns with our district instructional priorities. We're also engaging students through relationships and then focusing on preparing students for post secondary success. So there are some specific actions under each of those. And then on the next slide you can see some of the goals that we have for as far as outcomes are concerned with regards to post secondary readiness, graduation and student engagement. So this is a summary document, if you will.

start time: 977:35:16.000
end time: 979:43:30.000
confidence: 0.91
C: Did you go over two slides prior? I think. Did we touch on the preview? Yeah, there.

start time: 980:47:10.000
end time: 980:55:34.000
confidence: 1.00
B: Sure.

start time: 980:57:02.000
end time: 992:53:10.000
confidence: 0.94
D: So we in the board goals, the formal board goals are focused on graduation, but we also report on college readiness, which is measured in a variety of ways. So it is three advanced coursework, three courses. So it could be three classes of either advanced placements, an international baccalaureate course, or dual credit completion of the CTE pathway seal of biliteracy. There's a number of ways into that. So we also track and share with the board progress towards what we see as post secondary readiness.

start time: 993:09:00.000
end time: 993:20:52.000
confidence: 0.99
C: The goal.

start time: 993:21:56.000
end time: 1009:16:00.000
confidence: 0.95
D: You can see the goal overall, the board goal was set and for some of our. We're approaching it for all of our students. And there are areas that we need some specific focus. But the post secondary readiness is we look at both graduation and post secondary readiness. And post secondary readiness decision has additional requirements. Really looking at advanced coursework, which when you look at the high school success plan, there's a whole piece around are we doing CTE hands on work? Are we looking at preparing students to make a transition to either work technical or to directly to college? And this gets presented at about the same time to the overall board as when we do graduation grades. So similar data timing.

start time: 1009:37:40.000
end time: 1009:53:16.000
confidence: 0.95
C: Thank you.

confidence: 0.96
G: I have a question. I'm sorry. Looking at the. Just thinking about our. Our graduation requirements and I love that we. We're acknowledging that our requirements are more rigorous than. Than that of the state. And I'm grateful that we're exceeding that number. My question comes To, I guess it's twofold. One, are our requirements, our graduation requirements, are they a baseline for any college within Oregon so that if our students meet the graduation requirements for our high schools, then they, they automatically meet the requirements for all of our schools, our colleges within Oregon. And then the, the second part that I would ask. Well, I guess I'll, I'll pause on that one because I, I feel like if that's, if that's the case, then I'm, I'm struggling because just this past year, some of the students that, that graduated and I had a dad tell me, and I wanted to bring, I wanted to bring him back in so that I could have him speak to somebody else so that we could hear it. Somebody else outside of me could hear it directly, but I had a dad tell me that although he was glad that his son was walking, walking across the stage, he was sad that his son was walking across the stage and wasn't reading at a high school, at a high school level, but yet he graduated. And I don't even understand how that's possible because in my mind, we failed that student if we let them walk across the stage and they're not reading at the, they're not reading at the right level.

start time: 1043:31:00.000
end time: 1057:29:30.000
confidence: 0.94
F: So, Director Green, our graduation requirements are aligned with what's called the Oregon University System requirements. So we follow what are the entrance requirements for the public colleges and universities in Oregon, and we make sure that our graduation requirements align with those. So that's the easy answer. The harder question is the one that is your second question, which is how do we make sure that all of our students are graduating college and career, career ready? They have the critical thinking skills, the reading skills, the writing skills, the soft skills and the hard skills to be successful. And that there's no easy answer to that other than to say that there's an ongoing effort.

start time: 1057:32:10.000
end time: 1099:03:08.000
confidence: 0.95
C: And so with unlike other states or other districts that have other requirements for graduation in addition to pure credits, for example, there are some spaces where you have to have a minimum 2.0 HP. Your attendance has to be at 85% or a certain percentage or higher. You can't pass any particular class if you have more than 10 days of. So unfortunately, students, and please help me if I'm wrong, students in Oregon can graduate on credits with a 1.0 or a lower GPA with a 1.0 GPA, which we know is not satisfactory to get into any college or university anywhere really, in the country. Country. So then the question becomes, what do we have within our realm of control to provide. You know, we're providing the rigor, we're providing, you know, the curriculum. But how do we provide a standard so that, you know, we are encouraging more students to perform at higher levels than the bare minimum? Other systems, for example, and I'm just naming, have, because of the 2.0 requirement, have a grade, like a grade replacement policy, where teachers understand that if you give a child a D, you hurt them. And if a student receives an F in a class, they're required to take the class over. And if they take the class over and get a B, then that F is no longer in the calculation of your gpa. So different systems have different requirements. Unfortunately, we don't have that here in Oregon. And so it's set up such that students, you know, it's possible for them to graduate high school with a low gpa.

start time: 1099:06:04.000
end time: 1115:17:40.000
confidence: 0.94
D: And I think, you know, part of the focus of, you know, that our instructional priorities, which, you know, is really providing the through line from, you know, general policy right into the classroom around what does it mean to have grade level standardized instruction? What does that mean to have students, students engaged in rigorous content and across all content areas, and how are we really staying focused on that as part of the work we're doing? And I think that the question of how are we really looking at the skills and the readiness for students, I think is as a robust conversation, it's nuanced. And also we can talk about what are some of the indicators beyond what we see and how we're gathering that information.

start time: 1115:45:20.000

B: Yes, thank you for calling me. So I had a similar experience at one of our graduations. And I was trying to run back into person, talk to Dr. Franco was coming out of one graduation. So this is a lady and she, when I knew her from the past and we were talking and I was congratulating her about her kid graduating, and she stopped me.

start time: 1124:53:06.000

start time: 1131:07:00.000
end time: 1136:46:10.000
confidence: 0.91
B: And so I had that same experience during this year. The other question I had was, well, when I hear, well, we can graduate, I understand our graduation doesn't mean proficiency. I get that. But I don't understand how we are using our rigors for college.

start time: 1136:53:10.000

start time: 1138:25:10.000
end time: 1143:18:39.000
confidence: 0.90
B: But if we can graduate people at a 1.0 how it seems like that's. Yeah, it doesn't seem like that makes it like we're doing this at this college level but then we can graduate at 1.0 how they can't get into college so how are we going to college system when graduating?

start time: 1143:38:59.000
end time: 1163:56:12.000
confidence: 0.94
C: The other thing before I just wanted to throw in too because what is brought to my memory also about the state of Oregon is that while we do have the state assessment at the 10th grade level, at the high school level which in and of itself is intended and could be very rigorous to unveil some of these deficiencies and proficiency within our students unlike other districts states such it's not a part of the high school so. And we have a opt out process where many students don't have to take the state assessment that would really answer the question for each and every student regarding how are they translating their learning and how are they able to demonstrate proficiency in English and mathematics at minimum.

start time: 1163:57:46.000
end time: 1188:57:54.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Science we used to have this was before pandemic. We used to have an essential skills requirement and so kids could meet the essential skills requirement through a number of things. SBAC or OSAS was one, how they scored on the SAT or the ACT was another. And if they couldn't meet there then they could put together a work sample portfolio which was. And so they had to meet though one of those pieces in order to graduate. But since the pandemic ODE is. Has since gone away with, with that level of expectation. Another way of measuring students proficiency aside from say credit and those types of things. You know this, I love this conversation because it really to me brings up the topic of, of grading in particular. And I actually, I didn't. You asked Director Wang about what, what are some topics potentially. I think that's an outstanding topic. You know one of the things too you think about too is And I think Dr. Proctor mentioned it, you know I've seen scales where it's A, B, c. There's no Ds. Nobody gives Ds. And like I said, if a kid is, if a student is not proficient then what are those opportunities then to get them up to that level right across the board. But that's a whole, I mean that's a big, big conversation which I would really love to have.

start time: 1188:59:22.000
end time: 1192:06:26.000
confidence: 0.92
C: Yeah. To see if we can make some add back some of the proficiency requirements they talked about and then look at that and then go ahead.

C: Well, we also have to realize if someone doesn't have a high school diploma, then they're stuck. They can't go on. And so I don't think we expect everybody to be college ready, even though we kind of say that, but I don't think we expect that. And also, I mean, I have a grandchild who plenty capable of just plain lazy. So, you know, get managed to graduate with the help of a lot of teachers. And now she's going on. Now that she's older, she's going to do more.

B: Yeah, I think you brought up a huge issue as well. If we increase the graduation standards, are we also eliminating certain other pathways? Right. So this is a heavy topic. I also want to address kind of Director Green and also Director Hollins you mentioned, as someone who has taught high school, I would say, you know, those kids you're talking about, they're probably really smart. Because one of the things that I want to mention too is that a lot of the reading issues come not in high School actually starts really early, like, talking about elementary, middle school, because one of the things that we see in high school a lot is that kids who have struggled reading, especially in elementary school, have developed strategies to get by without having to be able to read. So, I mean, they're smart in that way, and then they figure out how to get by. And so they can still get through high school without figuring out how to. Without actually learning how to read. They just fake it, whatever, but they figure out how to get through. And I think that gets the bigger issue that you mentioned earlier about how we're talking about grading, assessment, how effectual that is in terms of catching. And I think that raises another question in terms of, like, do we want to talk about also what kind of system do we have in place that we can catch these kids that are not reading appropriately? And what kind of remedial systems that we can. You know, I mean, we. I know that we do have some. But, like, in terms of how we increase their effectiveness or even catch more students, you know, something where, you know, like, we're talking about SPAT and disabilities, that's a huge one. Identifying, for example, dyslexia earlier, even earlier than we, you know, I think we are. From what I remember, we're making some good progress on that. You know, things like that. And so, I mean, that. That goes beyond, I think, high school graduation, which is what I want to want to point out. Catch him early.

C: And the other factors that could be discussed with high school graduation requirements as well is proficiency. You know, we sometimes think of proficiency as reading, math, and in the academics. But proficiency is also demonstrated when a student who's going through a CTE career pathway is able to not only take and pass the NOCTI exam, but also take and pass that industry credential. And how do we set up our students to have options to graduate with a high school diploma where they could go to college if they choose, while at the same time graduating with an industry credential? That is something that I work. Most of my schools that I supervised in Philly were CTE schools as well. And what does it look like if the child graduates with a triple whammy of also having some dual enrollment under their belt? So when I think about the portrait of a grand graduate, it really is. How do we set up our students so that they could graduate with as many options as possible that they. That they may choose? So there's a way of weaving in proficiency through a career as well, like you're saying. And just to back up what you said too. We set up in San Diego some of our high schools so the kids can actually graduate from with a minimum entry qualification for any job. Like, they could go into bioservice, they could go into biomedical, they could go into nursing, but it was woven into their daily practice in the classroom. So we had people from the industry who actually taught those classes at CTE and gave them the certification. So, yes, you're correct.

F: Yeah, we're in the process of exploring what implementing equitable grading practices would look like at the middle school and high school. And so if you were interested in having us report on what, what those plans look like, we have to come back.

G: I'm interested in that as well, Director. So thanks to go. Before we go, I do have one question I'd like to volley to you so that I can get direction as to how I could. What I should expect moving forward as it pertains to the adding, adding ROTC and JROTC to the, to the multiple pathways for graduation. Who, who would be the best person in our, within our district to look and see the viability of that. And is that something that, that like I'm looking at and I'm online, so I'm looking at, at Dr. Proctor, who does curriculum. And I know that she has experienced this in other states and school districts that she's worked with. So would that be something that. What would be the best path? Because I don't want to leave here with an expectation that someone is looking into this and going to bring me something back and they're not. So if I could get a level of clarity around that, it would be greatly appreciated.

C: Director Green, I'd be happy to work with my team at Multiple Pathways High School, even in some middle school redesign elements to bring together a team so that we could bring some information together to see what has been done in the past, what can be done, what's possible. You know, it will be A lift because here in Portland, and I think Oregon is a state, it's not something that is maybe done and that's part of my investigation as well. And I could also investigate what it looks like with the team. And I see Philippe is taking notes and I know he's very interested as well. So we'll put together a team and we will be able to share what we have discovered, what's possible, how we could look, start planning forward if it's something that we have to engage community teachers and such and the board and, and all stakeholders into this discussion. But it is definitely something we could look into and bring back some information.

end time: 1359:04:38.000

G: And I can definitely tell you that Oregon's. It may be Portland, but it's not Oregon as a whole because Oregon City has a very robust ROTC and JROTC program that's functioning within several of their, their high schools. At least three that I was able to research.

confidence: 0.92
C: Great, great. And I came from a district many years ago where it felt like every high school had a, had a ROTC JROTC program. And yeah, so it is definitely something that is worth. It builds leadership in students. It gives them opportunities and options, you know, a sense of discipline. And again, leadership is, could be formulated through these areas as well.

G: So there's a lot of career building within those programs. And again, I'm looking at, not that this would be something that benefits, that has to benefit every single student. I just know that there are some students that this could be a benefit for. The same way engineering, mechanical engineering is going to benefit some students and nursing is going to benefit some students. The trade work, when you start thinking about sheet metal workers and you start thinking about the framers, the plumbers, the electricians, all those benefits some students. I'm trying to give as many of our students as possible a pathway to a career or an opportunity or something that would elevate them to a space where they feel that there's hope and that they believe in themselves and what they're capable of doing and becoming.

C: There's a misconception that just because a student goes to through a JRRTC program, that means they're automatically going into the military. And many of, I have, many of my students have gone to college and went on to have fine careers outside of the military. But those who wanted that option, it was, it was an option for them as.
