A: Alright, let's get started. As you know, the Board is supposed to meet every other week. So this is. Thanks for coming out of vacation to deal with this issue. Alright, this meeting for the board of education February 11, 2025 is call to order. All items to be considered this evening are posted on the PPS website on the Board and meetings tab. This meeting is being streamed live on PPS TV Services website and on Channel 28 and will be replayed through the next two weeks. Please check the district website for replay times. Welcome and thanks for being here. Tonight's special meeting before we get started, few housekeeping reminders. We ask that everyone attending this meeting tonight, members of the public staff and board members, treat each other with respect. If you wish to display signs, please hold those below chin level for safety reasons. Keep the walkway aisles clear, be mindful of each other and yeah, also let's see. Currently the Board right now has a bet on whether we can finish this meeting in 30 minutes or under. So I'll try to read this as fast as I can to make it fair. The purpose of tonight's meeting is to provide some guidance to the Superintendent in order to improve and provide cost reduction options for the high school modernization projects that are on the 2025 General Obligations Bond. It is our responsibility to identify four staff in our community, some guardrails and if you will, for cost reduction and trade offs. I'm going to turn this over to Director Ben Edwards to introduce this framework for delivering modernized high schools with cost reductions with the goal to adopt the framework tonight. Director Ben Edwards thank you Chair Wong.

B: So I'm bringing tonight to the Board a resolution with a framework for consideration which would direct the Superintendent to pursue and deliver cost reductions in the three high schools targeted for rebuilding and modernization. As background, the board and staff built the outlines of the next capital bond for the May 2025 election. At that time, board members and the superintendent asked about the elevated costs in the high schools. In November, the district contracted with the Cornerstone Management Group to evaluate our costs for for the next three high schools and to compare them to the previous PPS high school modernizations and also with Beaverton High School which is currently being built. In addition to effectively utilizing tax dollars, a reason for us to be looking at cost reductions in our high schools was so that PPS could potentially take those cost savings and add them to the investments already in the May bond for improvements and critical repairs in our aging elementary and middle schools. January 7th was the day was the date set for the board vote on the bond referral to the May ballot, which we did. At that time, Board and staff did not yet have the cost evaluation report, but the Board did vote to refer the measure, knowing that receiving the report at the end of January would still give us time to direct cost reductions in the high school modernizations. The Board received the PPS High School Cost Comparison Report completed by Cornerstone and received additional information from the Office of School Modernization regarding the projected costs. Last week the Board had a I think it was last week, wasn't it? Okay, time flies. Last week the Board had a meeting to discuss the Cornerstone report and cost reduction strategies and talk about our priorities both for what should be in the in the buildings and potentially what could be reduced or eliminated. Following that meeting, Directors Holland, Splitt and I met to create a draft set of requirements for the modernizations and a framework for cost reductions. Suggestions from the Board and Superintendent were incorporated into the framework, so I hope everybody sees their contributions and thoughts and priorities in that in the framework, modernization cost reductions are called for in two general areas, general contractor cost reductions and modernization cost reductions. In terms of the general contractor cost reduction, the Board directs the Superintendent to provide potential near term cost reduction options and associated trade offs regarding cost items such as pre construction services, general conditions, contractor fee, and more. In addition, in the midterm, the Board directs the Superintendent to provide recommendations related to future contracting, method utilization and efficiencies related to PPS project management. The second area of reductions were related to the modernizations. The Board establishes requirements for the modernization and directs the Superintendent to use the guidelines to provide potential cost reduction options, associated trade offs regarding hard construction costs including reduced building square footage, lower cost building systems and materials. It's important to note while the guidelines in the framework call for cost reductions in all three of the high school project, it also establishes that the schools will be built to meet PPS's comprehensive high school Education Specification Area Program minimum requirements for number and sizes of spaces and to be similar in terms of classroom and spaces that the previously modernized high schools have had. In addition, all three high schools will have a foundational level of athletic facilities and physical activity spaces. The buildings will be all electric and shall conform to PPS equity and contracting provisions. The requirements call for reduced square footage in all three high schools setting requirement of about 25, 295,000 square feet which is similar in size to the rebuilt Lincoln and Franklin high schools. Staff also should provide additional cost reductions including the reduction or elimination of spaces over and above the ED specs and certifications other than LEED Gold certification, childcare centers and school based health clinics may be optional depending on demonstrated need or provider availability. The framework also calls for the high school design advisory groups at each school to reconvene as soon as possible assuming the board adopts this framework. And with that I'd like to ask. I'd like to thank Director Hollins and Split for helping craft this framework and offer if you'd like to add anything or say a few words about it, please feel free to do so.

C: Thank you. Mostly I want to thank Director Brim Edwards in turn for getting us organized to have a conversation without having a quorum so that we could develop something and move it forward. At this meeting tonight. I mostly just want to say on behalf of the families in the Ida B. Wells cluster, I think that having the. The community be able to work on the reductions I think is really key and having a voice in that process. But I think also it's just as key to show like you started out with the. The care that we have for taxpayer dollars as a board and to demonstrate that and make sure that we are meeting not just the needs of the high schools, but other needs in our middle school and elementary schools as possible within the bond amount. And so I just want to say thank you for kind of taking those values that we all shared and additionally the values we have around climate and equity and putting those in so that we kind of can all be on the same page but move forward with something a little bit more structured. So thank you very much for your leadership, Director Hollins.

In addition, in the midterm, the board directs the superintendent to provide recommendations related to current and future contracting methods, method utilization and efficiencies related to the Office of School Modernization Project Management. Correct. Any discussion? Sir, I was going to ask Dr. Armstrong if you have any opinions on that. I am fine with that change. Seems like we have general consensus, so we can. Yes. Yeah. So as amended. Do I even have to say that? Is there any more board discussion? Thank you.

end time: 194:45:40.000

confidence: 0.96
A: Yes, thank you for just. Quick comment. Just want to appreciate the work that has gone into this. Not, you know, all the work that has led up to this, including relooking at all our contracting. So I just want to reiterate really clearly. This whole process is a long term process. It doesn't just finish today. It is something that we continue. It is the job of the board to oversee the spending of public money. And this is our commitment. Right? This is our commitment that we will continue this work to make sure that our money is being spent well. Sorry. Public money is being spent well. It is a difficult job. At the same time, we are also want to make sure. That the Cleveland Wells community understand that we are, we are committed to giving them something like a Lincoln or Franklin or maybe even, you know, with some custom options for their, their population. And they're. We're committed to giving them an equivalent school and just want to make that clear. This is. We're tackling two things at once here. Making sure our public dollars go as far as possible as well as making sure our Wells and Cleveland community get beautiful, state of the art schools. That's all I have to say. Thank you.

start time: 221:55:40.000
end time: 243:08:54.000
confidence: 0.95
E: And I think I would add to that that not only are they getting beautiful state of the art schools, but that we are not looking to minimize their. The ed specs. We're not looking to take away their theater rooms. We're not looking to take away their arts rooms. We're not looking to take away any of the things that are important to the. To the students and the communities of those schools and those in those communities. I'm hoping. I'm hoping that tonight what this does is this sends a loud message, a resounding message across the district and across the city that this school board values every school, every student, every community. And we're not in any way, shape, form or fashion looking to take anything away from our students and our communities. And I just want to say it out loud so that it's stated for the record that and it's Jefferson, Ida B. Wells and Cleveland, you are going to get state of the art schools. They're going to be magnificent and it is going to be great. So I just, I just need that out there so that people can stop saying y'all are trying to take my arts. I don't do theater, but I want all the people that do do it to have it. You know what I mean? So, like, let's just have it.

A: Bibb members.

start time: 246:54:20.000
end time: 300:39:50.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Sure. There was a couple things and I want to thank staff because when we got the cost reduction report, there was a lot of information in it that we'd been waiting for for some time. And we had a lot of questions. I had a lot of questions. And I really appreciate the very thorough responses you all provided because it definitely informed the drafting of the framework. And there's two things I wanted to just call out because there's been this. There's a little bit of a narrative, like how come ours is so much more, you know, expensive and we are going to be reducing cost. And I think there's just a couple things that's important to note that came out of the answers to the questions. First of all, the comparison with Beaverton. Their school is being built for 1500 students versus 1700 students. Beaverton is on 47 acres versus Cleveland which is on 8 acres. And actually two 4 acre postals in Beaverton they didn't include the kitchen cost because one already existed. That's another 18 million. They don't have a teen parent child center, they don't have a health care center. They still are putting fossil fuel infrastructure in and the escalation isn't quite synced up. So just want to note that when people are like look at what Beaverton did is like there are some very substantial differences between the projects. The other item I want to just call out along that same lines is that in the answers to the questions that we got, it also notes that there's this sort of, there's a comparison of Lincoln and Beaverton and trying to look at what the, if you did escalation for Lincoln, how it would compare to Beaverton. And I'm just noting that it's one of the answers to the question when I asked about that was that the answer is there's a large error in the Cornerstone report which they have admitted in terms of the escalation and that they used a 5% escalation when it should. The market average was 8% which results in a $45 million error in the report which is quite material. So I just want to note that when we're talking about the cost of things and the comparison so it's hard to do an apples to apples. And we should note, I think our teams have been good stewards of our tax dollars to date and that a straight out comparison is not always fair. I do have. This is just for the record, Dan, I'm wondering if you could speak to with the reduction in the square footage and the other direction that's been provided, do you have an approximate per project cost, like a range potentially of the cost reductions that we might achieve?

start time: 300:54:50.000
end time: 308:56:44.000
confidence: 0.95
G: Yeah. Good evening. Dan Young, chief operating officer. Good to see everyone. When we look in totality of we look through the framework which is super helpful, it gives excellent guidance to staff of how to proceed forward shooting from the hip. Don't hold it to us but we colloquially were thinking about 20 to 40 million dollars of savings per project. And so that's kind of where we think we are. We're happy to say that we've had that discussion. But once we get into the work.

start time: 308:58:12.000
end time: 309:19:20.000
confidence: 0.88
A: Of course we'll know more.

start time: 309:35:00.000
end time: 311:06:36.000
confidence: 0.93

start time: 311:09:08.000
end time: 313:16:42.000
confidence: 0.97
G: We were looking at that in total. Again, it's a big range. The projects are going to be different, but we'll know more soon.

start time: 314:35:14.000
end time: 315:08:26.000
confidence: 0.90

start time: 315:09:38.000
end time: 318:59:38.000
confidence: 0.95
B: Yeah. Well, can I do that? That that can then be put into the added to the investments that we're making already in this bond. 190 million into the elementary and middle school infrastructure.

end time: 319:13:30.000

start time: 319:16:10.000
end time: 323:46:54.000
confidence: 0.97
B: Okay. And then just my last question. Do you have what you need in order for the projects teams to continue their work and for the design advisory groups to reconvene?

start time: 323:49:02.000
end time: 331:37:00.000
confidence: 0.93
G: Yes. This again, this framework is very helpful. You know, immediate next steps are going to be re engaging the full design teams who've been on pause and also putting together really updates, engagement and communication plans. The design advisory groups are a piece of that, but they're of course not the only piece. And so there are a number of other stakeholders and stakeholder groups and other opportunities for engagement. So we'll be putting updating basically our plans based upon where we are now.

start time: 331:52:40.000
end time: 334:24:48.000

H: Well, I first want to thank my colleagues and staff for the amazing work they've been doing on this bond and this package that was shared today. I think I met with the student representatives to the Climate Crisis Response Committee and things they shared with me was a strong support for a bond that supports sustainability efforts and performing arts. One of the concerns they shared with me, they felt like lots of students weren't really involved in the process of the bond. So I think whether that's during the campaign or during our period of kind of developing the bond, if we could include student voice more, that would be really helpful.
