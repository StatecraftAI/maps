B: Thank you. Good evening, board of directors. Happy to be here for another of our data dives tonight to talk about not only the graduation rate for the class of 2023, but also their post secondary readiness. As you probably saw in the presentation, we have these four guiding questions. What is our rate for the class of 2023 and how does that compare to the state of Oregon? And over time, what are our high school grad. Our grad rates by high school. How did this class perform on the various indicators of post secondary readiness? And then I think what has. What I've found to be most atypical of the questions board directors have is really like the what. So what. What's next? So what is our reaction and action steps in response to the data that we had? So we're going to try to cover all of that in the next 30 minutes or less.

B: So as we discuss these data, it's important to remind the public and the board that These graduates in 2023 were our students whose freshman year was interrupted by the pandemic. So they had about two thirds of a school year in person and they were sent home in March and then they had their entire sophomore year online in virtual instruction and then came back that next year with some forms of hybrid before we got back completely face to face full time. And as you know, we've had some, as has been shown through our enrollment loss. I know I can speak for high school principals when I say there was great effort to reconnect with students who had, some of whom simply we didn't know what happened to them. They quote unquote disappeared. So I just wanted to throw that out into the ether as a consideration about these data tonight. On this slide you have our four year grad rate in red and our five year completion rate in blue. As you can see, our current grad rate and completion rates both declined slightly. For the class of 2023, our grad rate is 84.5% which is a decrease of about 1.2 percentage points over the previous class. Additionally, our five year completion rate is now at 89.5%, a slight dip of a half a percentage point compared to the Class of 2022. For this year's Class 2023, we had a total of 2,993 graduates out of over 3,500 students in the graduating total cohort. When we think about our grad rate compared to the state, even with our slight dip in graduation rate, PPS continues to outperform the state of Oregon in four year grad rate data. For the class of 2023, Oregon posted a grad rate of 81.3% which was holding steady to their previous grad rate while PPS grad rate was 3.2 percentage points higher at 84.5%. As I previously mentioned.

B: I'm gonna. I'm gonna ask if you could hold questions and see if we can get through the presentation pretty quickly and then we can have a robust conversation. This screen shows our graduation completion rates by race over the past three years. The most recent grad rate is shown on the top in the darkest shade of blue. The differential grad and completion rates are shown and fall along those predictable and unacceptable lines of race and ethnicity. Our student groups with the highest rates include our Asian, white and multiracial students who are white and Asian. It is also important to call out our fifth year cohort completers, which is something that the state tracks as we do as well. You can see those differences between and among the student groups. Here are our one year differences in graduation rates comparing the classes of 2022 and 2023. As you can see, the Hispanic, Latinx and multiracial and not underserved grad rates remain relatively flat while all the other grad rates experienced a decline. Here the African American grad rate has decreased by over 3 percentage points and the Asian grad rate decreased by 1.2 percentage points while the Native and Pacific Islander rates have also decreased. Interpretation of these differences should be made with caution as there are very few students in either group, typically around 25 or so students in each of those groups compared to the other groups that have hundreds or thousands of students. It's important to note that our five year core completed percentage experience increases in the black and multiracial groups. And here are our year to year differences in five year completion rates for students by race. I'll give you a moment to study those differences and here are graduation rates by each high school. With the exception of two schools, all high schools earn graduation rates at or above 77% for this year in particular, Jefferson High School reached a grad rate of over 91%. Six of our high schools graduated over 90% of their students. Next we'll look at year to year changes in grad rate by high school. As you can see, about half of the schools showed an increase and about half of the schools showed a decrease. Of note, alliance and Jefferson are seeing the largest one year increases while McDaniel and MLC are showing the largest one year decreases as was the case with graduation rate. When we look at 5 year completion rates by high school, we can see that almost all schools have five year completion rates of roughly 80% or higher. Overall PPS continues to see progress in the percentage of students who graduate within five years. This is of course a testament to the hard work of our principals, their staffs, our students and their families and caregivers. Next we have our year over year change in five year completion rate for high school. Here you can see that MLC had the greatest positive change with an increase of 16 percentage points, while other schools show a mix of increases and decreases ranging from plus two and a half percentage points to minus four percentage points. While one of our secondary measures of success is grad rate or high school completion, we also are keeping an eye on how prepared students are for college and or careers. Prior to adopting graduation rate as a board goal In June of 2021, the board had a high school goal for students centered on Post Secondary readiness. So next we'll examine our district trends in this area. As a reminder, there are several indicators of Post Secondary Readiness. There are actually six that we are tracking and monitoring Successful completion of Advanced Placement purposes, International Black Laureate or IB courses, successful completion of dual credit courses, completion of a career and technical pathway, attaining the seal of biliteracy and or successful attainment of a Post Secondary readiness score on a standardized measure, either that being psat, the sat, or the actual overall Post Secondary readiness Data are shown on the screen along with the previous board goal for context, data are shown for the last four years with the most recent year shown in the deepest color purple. As you can see, Post Secondary readiness for the class of 2023 decreased overall and for each student group except multiracial students and Pacific Islander students. Also of note is the fact that most students are meeting the previous board goal of 56% with the exception of Black and Latinx students, Native students, and Pacific Islanders.

B: On the next few slides, we'll unpack the Post Secondary readiness indicators that come together to paint this picture of college and career readiness. We'll start with Advanced Placement AP courses shown on the screen. Of the percentage of students who earned a C or better in at least three AP courses, you will note that between this year and last year, the overall percentage has increased for all PPS students, White students, and multiracial students. The percentages of Black and Latinx students meeting this indicator was flat or decreased ever so slightly. International Baccalaureate course completion remains very low for native, Black and Pacific Islander students. Overall, the rate for all students decreased, likely credited to decreases among groups of White students, Asian students, and multiracial students who are underserved. Also students of color. The overall percentage when we think about dual credit of students completing three or more dual credit courses rebounded with an increase from 2022 to the class of 2023. Increases were observed for Black, native, multiracial, underserved students, and White students. Next, we'll take a look a deeper dive at the percentage of students who completed a career in technical pathway, which currently involves completing three or more courses in the same pathway. While overall the percentage of CTE rates has increased, decreases are noted for students of color, including our Black students, our Latinx students, Pacific Islander students, and multiracial students who are underserved. Biliteracy remains an asset in today's global economy, so we know it's important for students to have that skill if they can attain it. For the class of 2023, the percentage of students earning the seal decline by 9 percentage points to 11.7 and in fact year to year decreases are noted for all student groups. It will be important here to let the public and the Board know that the requirements changed coming into this year for earning a seal and we think that had something to do with the decrease. We also examine students performance on college entrance exams as a measure of postsecondary readiness. Each of these exams has a threshold or score that indicates post secondary readiness. Here, as has been the trend with PPS assessment data, performance varies along the lines of race with black students showing the lowest achievement level among all groups, although they demonstrated a performance increase of almost 2 percentage points. So overall both our four year cohort graduation rate and our fifth year completion rate showed some slight decreases for the class of 2023 as compared to the class of 2032. There remain our unacceptable generational persistent gaps along the lines of race and ethnicity and overall post secondary readiness rates decline between 2022 and 2023 with those persistent gaps again prevalent across those measures. At this point I'm going to call on my colleagues from the school performance team to talk about the PPS response and action steps.

F: Good evening. I'm Margaret Calvert. I'm one of the Assistant superintendents with Forum Public Schools and we have a group with us today to talk through theory of actions that we have in place and some responses to the data that you're seeing in front of you. We started in 2017 to build out a high school success plan. It was part of in response to some investments made by the state to what we call measure 98. That high school success plan has a specific theory of action that we've been had in place and held essentially in place consistently for the last seven years with specific strategies that you will see will highlight that that will surface some of the changes that we will that we are looking at to support our students of color and our focal students in particular. Overall, we're seeing a decline for the first time in quite a number of years and that the differences in graduation and post secondary readiness persistent gaps. There are some spaces that we're seeing some improvements that we want to highlight as well. In general, the theory of action is grounded in looking at focal student work and looking at focal students and saying how are we working to provide them not only access but successful completion that then moves them towards graduation. Part of this work also starts in the freshman year with our freshman success teams. So we look at there are four specific places that we are intentional about looking at race and disrupting predictability of outcomes based on race, improving instruction and alignment, engaging students through meaningful relationships and preparing students for post secondary success. We do that by targeting efforts towards our local students, ensure that all of these impediments that we are, that we are seeing for student success, we remove as many barriers as possible. Then we'll graduate students that are ready to take take part in post secondary the next step. So that's sort of the general theory. It's embedded in a high school, in our high school success plan that is tied to our strategic plan and then also it's connected to our instructional framework. So we're trying to create alignment and coherence across. But then we'll talk about things within the plan that we're trying that we will use to leverage and address some of the things that surfaced in the data this year.

G: So John Franklin Chief of Schools so I think it's important to so the high school success plan, as Margaret was initially started as part of the Measure 98 work, which was freshman success. And it has adapted and evolved based on data annually. So this is something that the team annually reviews. And when I say team, it's a collective approach in regards to, first of all, principals. High school principals have to be immensely involved in this work. Also members of Osprey Office of Teaching. If you look at the high school success plan, you'll see three big indicators or goals. Improve instruction and line assessment. So that's been a big piece. You've seen it. Some of the math and the ELA presentations working to establish coherence there in terms of utilizing the curriculum. Collaboration from a PLC perspective has been extremely important. And then just getting in the classrooms, that's the biggest piece. Getting in the classrooms and having our building leaders provide feedback on how it's going, engage students through relationships. I mean, that has been a consistent question from this board about how importantly important that piece is about setting aside time every day to establish connection. I think we all know that students learn better when they feel like the content is relevant. And the only way they feel like it's relevant is that we have a connection. If I know what your interests are, where you're from, all that good stuff, and enveloping those pieces within one structure and then preparing for post secondary success. We acknowledge, we know that high school graduation completion is a step, it's a door. We're also very cognizant about what are we doing to prepare our kids for beyond high school. So we're tracking and you're seeing, we're Incorporating strategies in terms of barriers to ap, dual credit, ib, like those are pieces like, we want access for all of our students in classes. Also, it means sometimes, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's the self efficacy piece, right? If I go into a classroom that's maybe AP or IB and say I don't see students that look like me, you know, it's a self selection piece. So we want to make sure, right, that we are creating those avenues to where not only we have increased enrollment, but it's support while students are enrolled in those classes. And I'll turn it over to Lauren to talk a little bit about some of the MPG work which has been distinct. And even though we've had a slide with graduation, you can see the trajectory over the course of the last 10 years.

D: Thank you. Good evening. Lorna Pass, Senior Director of Schools Part of our efforts with high school graduation include supporting students who need credit recovery or need to learn in a way that's different. So for the class of 2023, 676 of those graduates across all of our schools and PPS earned credit through Portland Evening Scholars or Summer Scholars. We also expanded Portland Evening Summer Scholars during the pandemic with Esser funds. It used to be that we just had classes at Benson High School. We moved into several other high schools and we will be returning to Benson when. But we will also be maintaining some of those additional options. Roosevelt is a pretty important one because it's very hard for a lot of our students from St. John's to come in for an evening class at Benson. But we also expanded to Franklin, to McDaniel temporarily, to the Kenton campus, and to Roosevelt. So we saw 676 of those graduates earn credit. And some of the statistics are really important. Of native students, 25% of them earned evening or Summer scholar credits toward graduation. For black students who graduated, it was about 35%. Very similar for Hispanic Latino students, 45% for Hawaiian, Native Hawaiian students. So we know that we are reaching a lot of students who may not otherwise complete all of their graduation requirements. We also have Virtual Scholars, which embeds online classes taught by PPS teachers who are at a hub but can zoom in to students in all of our comprehensive and most of our alternative schools. And students can pick up a class that they need for graduation through virtual. Some of our students prefer to learn that way. Others maybe didn't pass a class the first time. And so this is another way that they can access that credit. So we saw 566 of the class of 2023 had earned credit through Virtual Scholars. So we're proud of those two programs and our other multiple pathways programs for really working with our comprehensive and focused option high schools and alternative school schools to really help more people to graduate. Turn it over to Frazier.

H: Good afternoon. Chris Frazier, Senior Director of Schools as well. So again, as a system, we've created some very tangible actions that we are hoping will help increase college readiness for our students. So some of the things that we've done that areas or areas Superintendent Calvert spoke to was deliberate support in ninth grade. We recognize that ninth grade there's a huge transition from middle school to high school. And so there's been some very intentional support students in that journey. One thing that we've created in all of our high Schools, it's a 9th grade student success team or academy model. So 9th grade students take a freshman inquiry course which is taught by one core teacher as well as in this meaning English, math and or science. And then on that other day they are then involved in freshman inquiry. So students are building that relationship with that teacher. So they are seeing that teacher every single day. And to Dr. Franco's point, helps build that relational trust that is needed between the student and the teacher as an embedded support transition into high schools. Teachers who support the academy have a release period which also provides an opportunity in which they can come together as a team and discuss bright points with the students that they are all sharing. There's an opportunity as well for them to hold staffing for students. So again, if they want to reach out to parents, if they want to reach out to other support staff, counselors, school social workers that can help students navigate the ninth grade year a lot better. It's another way to just provide additional wraparound services and supports. This is a research based model that comes from the University of Chicago, which supports ninth grade on track success. Again, students having success their first year in high school fare better at reaching graduation. Additionally, what we've also done is expanded coursework for all students. So some examples in some buildings include this notion of advanced coursework. So you may hear AP Human Geography for all where a specific grade level is all taking that class as a way to help promote them and prepare them for college readiness. You'll hear in some schools, IB for all. It may be a certain grade level where students are taking IB Language Arts. It's a very interesting model and it's again, it's creating that culture of college readiness or secondary success for all of our students, regardless of what Their interest may be post secondary. So again, advanced coastal work for all is seen in seven of our nine comprehensive high schools and we're seeing a lot of success in that area. Lastly, we also have expanded dual credit options to increase performance for our Black and Native American students. So again, as shown, we have seen a definite increase in this area for our students that identify in these two areas. The largest contributing practice for Native American Black students was successful completion of dual credit classes. Classes such as Math 115, Reading and Writing 115 and Writing 121 again allow students the opportunity to receive college readiness education as well as preparing them and providing them college credits while they're still in high school.

G: Philip Veasey, Senior Director for High School Academics I'll just close us by saying that we're going to continue ensuring that our high school students have a strong foundation in core curriculum that's especially important at the 9th and 10th grade level as we try to continue increasing the number of students who are accessing advanced coursework as juniors and seniors. Just one thing to preview. Next year we'll be adding some additional supports at the high school level to allow high schools to support our focal students in particular to access and be successful in advanced coursework. And we'll be happy to report on.

E: So this follows up the questions that I asked earlier about. And it's more about early indicators. So, I mean, what we're seeing right now is the end result. And I'm interested in more early indicators and how we are responding to those. And the early indicators were. Would be, you know, students getting, you know, Ds so they're passing their class, but not proficient, which those students tend to get behind. So data on that we're looking at. And I'm assuming that where we had dips in graduation, that those. Those students didn't all just drop out their senior year. So what are we seeing in that? Freshman, sophomore, junior years. And what are the indicators that would tell us that a student is about ready to just stop coming to school for 10 days or, you know, just completely. So what indicators we're looking at for. For that, I'm interested also if we can get it just the disaggregated data by high school on the. Yeah, it's my written question on the different college and career readiness indicators. And then the final question is, I'm curious about what change happened in the seal of biliteracy and are we making adjustments for that? That was one place that I know when we started recognizing that it was a place where students often who hadn't been recognized for something else and something that may have been viewed as a deficit that was like an asset and recognized as such. I'd be interested of what. What changed and what we're doing to help students continue to achieve that.

A: Okay. And I just asked some additional questions that it's not on. So you guys can cut out number 13 on the list that I have. That one got answered. The other ones still looking for. And 19, those have been answered. So I just got a couple questions. One, when we talk about our graduation rates versus our college readiness and college and career readiness, for instance, our Black students graduate at 76.3, but their college and career readiness is 44.3. So are we saying there's 30% gap that is not ready for either college or career as well? So that's the one question. What are the number of students that utilize college credits to meet graduation standards and what are the demographics of that? And then also based on the talking about the summer and summer school and the night school, what percentage of students of color utilizes the summer school and night school Scholars program? And that's all my questions for that.

I: Yes. We ready? So while Dr. Franco was pulling up the power presentation, I want to say thank you very much for inviting me here today. I am Lavetta Benjamin Samuels. I'm the senior director for professional learning and leadership. I'm also the project director for our self study. That's Equity center pipeline initiative. However we call it recipe because we put the word race in front of it. So it's our racial equity pipeline initiative unlike the other seven districts who also received this grant. So joining me tonight are members of the core team. We have Dr. Franco, who is executive sponsor for this work. We also have Emily Donaldson, who's not here, but she's assistant from project director. For this work we have online, I believe Ann Clark. She is a program director from Wallace foundation and she is also coming to us tonight from North Carolina. Thank you, Ann for joining us. We have one of our two consultants here on screen tonight, Sheila Smith Anderson. She's joining us from Kentucky. We have a second consultant, Rob Larson. He is local, but he's not here. He's vacationing good thing for him. And we have a few of our university partners, a few of our University partners here, Dr. Molly Galloway from Lewis and Clark and I can't see who else is there. Okay, so we have other members part of the team. Many of the members are here in the room with me from the Office of Student Performance as well as other university partners, TSPC and the ode. So this is a self study. We were very fortunate to be able to get this study. So let me tell you how this happened. So Wallace put out a call to maybe 90 so school districts to apply for this grant. It was narrowed down to like 40 because some of them figured they could not do this. Then it got narrowed down to like 20. And we really was very strong in our application because historically we've been doing some of these things already. And the Equity center pipeline initiative really resonated with what we were doing. We are trying to always focus on being equity centered. So our history about having language about being equity centered is a strong suit. Many of the other seven districts who receive this grant does do not have this language as strong. So that was a great thing. We already had partnerships with our universities. That was a second positive thing. And I think that, you know, we really wanted to be able to, this is a study, right? So we wanted to be able to learn something and then share. So this at the end of our sixth year because the fifth year is when the grant ends, but the sixth year is when the research is going to be writing research reports and we'll get to review those and that information will be shared out with Oregon AS plus nationwide. So this is a big thing for us. We were awarded $8.2 million over five year time span. That amount de escalates as the year go by. Our partners are Portland State University and Lewis and Clark. We chose these two universities because they already have partnership with us and many of our staff go attend those schools. So what's the question about the study? The study says what Wallace is asking all eight districts to try to do, which include Baltimore Public School, Baltimore City Public School, Columbus City Public School, with some Salem foresight, District of Columbia, Fresno Unified, Jefferson County District and San Antonio Independent. And they asked us to say, well, whether and how districts can develop and implement comprehensive aligned principal pipelines that produce equity centered leaders who have helped bring a district vision to equity to petition. So Wallace has been doing research for 20 plus years around principle and leadership development. With this particular time they really focus in on equity. So we were very fortunate to receive this award and We've been working very diligently try to make sure PPs really shy.

confidence: 0.86
G: Right.

start time: 670:13:20.000
end time: 696:51:00.000
confidence: 0.93
I: We are very proud and we want to make PPS proud. No matter what we learn or don't learn, it's still we'll be contributing to research. Right. So we're really proud of that. So what we really believe here is that we want to move it so that our school, all of our schools have a leader who is equity centered, has a mindset and belief that align with our leaders profile. And we have a leader profile. We. I'll share it to you with you later. It talks about how we use the Oregon Standard language creator profile according to what we think our leaders should look like. Like I said, it's kind of in research, but I will kind of get it to you so you can see what it looks like. We have depositions, we're going to use that profile as we create documents throughout. Okay. And the profile was actually created with our district partners that you see on the screen. So. So we have this philosophy that we believe that in order for us to move our equity work, we have to get below the line on the iceberg. When it says transformation, we know we've done historically here in Oregon it has not worked. And we want to do things that are a little differently. We also know that besides teachers, the school based leader is the second most important factor in helping students with achievement and moving instruction. So we are actually focusing this grant really focused on principal, principal, supervisor, but the principal first. So what we are looking here for, our organization is to create systemic change. We want to get unstuck, we want to move the needle. So. So this work is.

start time: 696:53:00.000

start time: 697:25:40.000
end time: 698:27:48.000

I: Yes, please wait. I'm trying to talk really fast. I can get it all in. So hold on please.

confidence: 0.93
I: And if I can't answer you now, you know I'm getting back at you. Right, Gotcha. Okay. So this work is research based. It is centered on a pipeline model that has seven domains. And if you see there are seven on this diagram and each of these domains are actually being led by a team lead, their names up there on the screen. So for domain number one that really talks about leadership standards is Dr. Esther Ogilbehan. And then domain number two is talk about quality pre service. That is the learning that happens at university. And that is Dr. Molly Galloway and Tina Acker. And then we have the selection, hiring and you know, placement of principals. And that is Margaret, Margaret Calvert. And I think Lorna is helping her with that?

D: Yes.

start time: 711:44:50.000
end time: 723:32:38.000
confidence: 0.91
I: Yes. Okay. And then we have the principal evaluation and support, which is two parts. One part is how are we going to create a new principal evaluation tool, a new job description and new scoring guide to. Along with that. That's one part. The other part is professional learning and development. And we'll talk about how you want to change how we have started to change our culture by how principals learn. Domain 5, my colleague supervisor, Dr. Franco has been working diligently. This is about the principal supervisor standards. We currently do not have principal supervisor standards here in Portland Public Schools. And it's not unusual. Most schools do not, but there are national standards and Dr. Franco has already drafted a copy of that look like. And it's actually being socialized with the principal supervisor at this moment. You want to add anything to that? After.

start time: 723:34:54.000
end time: 723:40:38.000
confidence: 1.00
B: After.

start time: 723:41:34.000
end time: 782:07:40.000
confidence: 0.93
I: Okay. And then we have domain 6. And domain 6 really is a tracking system that we're trying to create. It should. It's going to be in collaboration with hr so we can actually use data to pull. Find out who has talent in our system, how we can use it for session planning. It's a big deal. We took. We have taken a lot of our funding and stacked it away to support. Support this system. And then we have my. I'm. I am the lead on that along with Derek. I'm brown out of it. And then sustainability system. Sustainability is in most school districts. Part of this. It is a superintendent who's leading this. I. My name is there to help the superintendent, but usually the superintendent in this cabinet because we want to be able to sustain all these domains under domain 7. I said that really fast. All right, so our district, you can see there's a diagram here has we. That talks about how you want to have a different look for our district culture. We've been working on this for quite some time. However, we're not. We're not there yet. So we still have some work to do. We recognize that and we just want to continue to move that work forward. We want to be able to learn differently. And here is where we have incorporated in particular how ISC units are working together to support principals. You have the Office of School Performance, Office of Teacher Learning and Office of Student Support Services. We're all working together to support the principal supervisors, support the principals, which is a big deal here for us because we haven't always been in collaboration and we're really, really happy that we're able to do that. So, you know, our principals have said to us, we'll go to the next Slide tell you this. Our principal says to us they want to learn differently. They don't want to be. They want to be involved differently. So we try to do different things. They asked us to be very intentional, consistent and purposeful about their learning. They asked us to have learning timely and differentiated for them because they come in different levels and with different knowledge. They wanted to make sure the scope and sequence of learning was appropriate and timely as well. They wanted to provide input as far as what their learning is. And we do have principals input when we the learning for the month or have principals panel. So they are helping with that and they want to have timely coaching and feedback and then multiple modes of learning and most importantly to be able to learn with their peers. Okay, next slide. So we took this to heart and we have done some things differently. So we structured leadership institute differently. You know, we have it now on non student days. We also have, when it's not a non student days. We have a Thursday in cohort in a school. We like that. We have collective learning. We better. We've been focusing really on having some particular routines in place. We have increased our having affinity spaces for our staff as well. And we are always looking at how we can have new learning but at the same time making sure it's cohesive. We are collaborating in multiple ways for learning for principals. They are using their skips to talk to each other. They have calibration around the observations that they've done in schools and in classrooms. We debrief data. We have some coaching practices and most important, all the principals are able to have consultancy. We do all this work in collaboration with the Office of Teaching Learning, Office of Service and OSP and also with the principal coaches. We also have other ways of helping people learn. You want to add something with that?

start time: 782:30:00.000
end time: 782:59:28.000
confidence: 0.91
G: Well, I want to do something at the end.

start time: 783:00:24.000

G: We have to go fast.

start time: 784:12:40.000
end time: 801:38:34.000
confidence: 0.93
I: And the last thing I want to talk about, go to the next slide please. Is that we have been focusing. We're not there yet, but we're focused on racial equity learning, how we bring everyone together. We still have little work for improvement, but we know that it's important for us to. And our principals have asked us for that. And here, next slide please. So here's some of the support services that we have in place and that are very targeted and intentional. We have support for our principal supervisor. We have principal coaches. We have affinity spaces. We have external professional learning opportunities. We also have induction for all APs, VPs and principals. Their first three years. They get induction support. Vice principal and assistant principal get additional support from their senior directors. We have our pipeline initiatives in place. We have grow your own programs that clean aspiring, include aspiring leaders and our future principal program. So the photo you saw on the front cover is our current cohort for aspiring principals while current APs and VP's looking to be principals for next year. Okay, I think I'll be quiet.

G: Now fullest thrill and I just want to real quick say that Loretta and her team have really done an outstanding job. Me coming in last year just being able to participate and then ultimately help lead. This work has been outstanding. When you're talking about working not only with pps, Lewis and Clark or the state TSPC to not only create that equity centered pipeline moving through, but actually being a foundation to our leader. Development in creating equity centered leaders has been outstanding. And you could see, you know that some of the adjustments that we have made through Leadership Institute and how we facilitated professional learning for principals is a direct result of not only the feedback that we get from leaders, but our work on Recipe. So we're really excited about this. It absolutely has been immense. And I would say this too. Like this is a sustainable system of practice. Right. So this can absolutely change culture. Not only I would say in pps, but State one.

start time: 821:12:50.000
end time: 824:11:22.000

I: I would just like to ask my colleagues if they would add anything to the presentation. They all, they are currently at a PLC. So there are PLCs for university partners. PLCs for directors.

start time: 824:36:34.000
end time: 840:14:50.000
confidence: 0.93
I: Oh yes, of course. PLC is a personal learning community. So they at the university. They're at San Diego right now, State and they're learning how to move their work forward. PSU and Portland State are actually working on clinical practice so that our leaders get more practice when they come to working for us. Sorry? Oh, they work. They start working here for us and we do it in collaboration. PSU is working with our PLL team and delivering the facilitation for our future principals. There are two faculty members plus Dawn Gillis who is a director of Professional learning here at pps. They're working on that. And I cannot do this work without having my consultant Sheila Smith Anderson and also Ann Clark who is a director. They just helped me so tremendously and we have much more technical support that helps open communications and we all do professional different times, all the time. Some very busy. Say the least.

start time: 840:29:10.000
end time: 865:56:40.000
confidence: 0.95
C: I would like to add something in just the accolades for the team. You spoke earlier about the ecosystem that you're trying to Develop across Portland public schools, hearing just a report of the graduation rate and some things that you're trying to look across race and gender and trying to change those numbers of going from 76 graduation rate, 46 college prep. Right. So how do you change that? And this is the game changer here. This is the game changer of what happens and how we support our leaders. And through all of the things that Portland has gone through the last few months, I just want to just shout out this team of keeping the line and holding the work steady. It did not slow up. It did not slow lockup. So that lets you, that lets me know there's system sustainability when you can go through a strike, when you can go through changes in the system and still continue to work on the work that you feel so greatly about and how you help to support your leaders, all leaders, to become equity centered leaders. And we believe your competencies are strong already. The university partners have already started to redesign their programs based on those leader competencies. So we feel like we've got a good recipe, pardon the pun, for greatness. And I'm excited to be a part of this history.

You can do it over the past, either from the time this thing started or the past 24 months. I can't remember when they said it started. And also, how does the recipe work to uplift the instructional leadership work and the instructional priorities like curriculum adoption and instructional framework. And that's all my questions.

And you don't have to answer this now, just email or whatever. But my question is like, how do we, how do we know what are the. Like, are there performance metrics that you use or feedback loops to figure out, like, you know, in terms of how successful the program. Program is and, and how you're improving your own work as well.
