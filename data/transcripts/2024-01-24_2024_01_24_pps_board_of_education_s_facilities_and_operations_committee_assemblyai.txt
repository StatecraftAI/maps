end time: 78:17:00.000
confidence: 0.94
B: Oh, well, we're gonna pick up time. Yeah, jump right in. So, first topic is Roosevelt grandstands. In the materials, in the board packet is a staff memo. I'll just do a real quick, kind of hit the highlights and then we can move into discussion. So at Roosevelt High School, the existing grandstands have a capacity of about 800 persons as requested. Staff have looked into the request to increase the capacity of the grandstands to 2,300, which should be 1500 on the home side and 800 on the visitor side, plus the addition of new storage facilities. This project would require design, land use permitting, and of course, construction. And the total cost is roughly 3 and a half to 4 billion as the scope has scoped. As the memo notes, capital funds, both bond and non bond, are Limited. And PPS's capital needs are expansive. The district's deferred maintenance backlog, just in and of itself, which is basically fixing broken things, exceeds $1 billion. The largest immediately available source of funds for capital projects is the 2017 bond program savings. As the 2017 bond program nears completion, projects and program savings become available for other eligible uses. Savings can be allocated to projects that meet a bond compensatory requirements. What that means is generally bond funds can be used for a variety of capital projects. However, prior to allocating bond funds to any scope of work that's not explicit in the bond language would need to be reviewed with bond council recommendation. Kind of getting to the upshot. Considering the condition of PPS's facilities and the limited availability of funding to address deferred maintenance and other existing building condition needs, staff recommends that the future improvements of Roosevelt grandstands be considered during development of general obligation font planning and that the savings that is available from 2017 bond be used for existing conditions. With that, we're happy to answer questions.

start time: 79:50:40.000
end time: 82:08:20.000
confidence: 0.97
F: So are we talking about not doing the stands? Can we bottom line it? Are we talking about not doing it and saving it for later?

start time: 82:31:50.000
end time: 87:54:10.000
confidence: 0.91
B: Yeah. To move forward with constructing the, the grandstands would require allocation of resources, those staff resources and funding. And so we're, you know, so the question of course would be where the funding comes from. What we're recommending is that be considered as part of general obligation bond planning.

start time: 88:54:30.000
end time: 89:22:50.000
confidence: 0.99
F: So are we doing them or not?

start time: 90:04:00.000
end time: 101:10:10.000
confidence: 0.95
B: The recommended. So currently, no. There is no current action moving towards that. If there is direction to proceed with them. There would be. The funds would need to be identified and the board, for example, could direct the superintendent to use any sort of funds, general fund, for example, or other capital funds. What staff is recommending is considering these improvements as a part of the bond planning effort that's going. If the board decides that that scope of work should be in the bond and that bond is subsequently successful, then the project would proceed for.

start time: 101:23:10.000
end time: 121:48:14.000
confidence: 0.97
F: So we need to do the Roosevelt grandstands. Why is it that Roosevelt is the one of the only schools in the district with the trashiest stands? They don't have visitor stands. Nobody wants to, wants to be over there. So to simply say, you know, if we should decide to do it, that's, that's dumb. Talk to me like it needs, we need to do it. It needs to get done. We, we should have done it back then. The, we should have redone the, the, the bleachers. We didn't get the bleachers that we were supposed to get. They're one of the only schools that had to pay for their stuff on their own. Everybody else got bond money and all this other money as where the, the investments that Roosevelt put into getting their bleachers done. A lot of other schools did not have to jump through those same hoops. And once again, we are forcing Roosevelt to just sit down and eat what they got and be quiet and I'm not okay with that. We need to get it done. So who do I need to talk to? Who do I need to convince to say we need to do this? Because to simply say staff wants to, you know, we think we need to defer it. I don't really know. Stop. We need to get this done.

start time: 121:51:02.000
end time: 129:23:40.000
confidence: 0.97
E: So, Director Green, I think what we have before us is staff has made a recommendation and obviously the committee can take. Take an action. We can either follow the recommendation or you could make another motion, but that would be the process. So staff is just coming with a rec. Is coming with a recommendation and materials.

start time: 130:18:40.000
end time: 132:02:20.000
confidence: 0.83
A: I have a question to When Roosevelt was done, was the grandstand initially part of that packet?

start time: 132:28:00.000
end time: 133:27:40.000
confidence: 0.91
B: No. So the grandstands were not a part of the modernization.

start time: 134:02:40.000
end time: 134:36:20.000
confidence: 0.90
A: I'm curious, why not? Was it.

start time: 135:30:40.000
end time: 156:28:34.000
confidence: 0.93
B: I don't think there's the. The most, I guess a linear answer to that. And I don't have total purview. What I do then I don't. I couldn't go through that project and say when scopes in, when scopes are out directly. What I do know is when the 2012 bond passed, which Roosevelt was a part of as well as Franklin grant, prior to the bond passing, the district said specs for high school were, I think, about 220,000 square feet. After the bond passed, that was increased, the capacity of the high schools was also increased. And so I think for those high schools, that was increased to roughly 285,000 square feet, substantially a quarter of the size larger. But no additional funds are made available to the bond program. There were some bond contingency, program contingency that were able to provide those projects, but not that much. So those three projects had to look for ways to cut scope to live within their means. And some of those decisions were athletics, with the idea being athletics are scopes of work. When you do large projects that can be added later where some scopes of work can't, like making every classroom 10% bigger after it's done, things like that. So that's, I think, part of the answer, but I don't want to imply.

start time: 156:29:22.000
end time: 177:51:50.000
confidence: 0.94
E: That'S, you know, I can also provide. Whoops. I can also provide some, some additional context. So I was on the board in 2012, but I was contacted at the time by Franklin parents who part of the rescoping that or value engineering that Dan was talking about was going to be the value engineering of essentially installing the pegs but not the seatings in the Franklin stands. And ultimately, because of conversations with the school community, they completed the stadium. And I believe the trade off was they were told that if they wanted a brick exterior to their performing arts center, they would need to pay for that, like upgrade the materials versus getting a lower grade material. And I raised the funds to do that. So it became a, a trade off. But Franklin, which was done around the same time, did have, I don't know what the seating is at Franklin, but it's pretty ample and was upgraded at the same, at the same time that the Roosevelt project was happening.

start time: 178:10:50.000
end time: 226:53:32.000
confidence: 0.96
F: And Roosevelt did get those kind of options because Roosevelt had to pay for their track and field on their own. Yeah, as part of that they had, they got some help from Nike and Nike put in the, like the last part of it, but Roosevelt didn't get any of that and they weren't given the offer to have any of that. And then when we, when, when it came down to it and we was like this, this isn't going to work. We ended up having to take, take the, the stands. The current stands that are at the Roosevelt football stadium are actually the stands that were supposed to be used on the baseball side. And they got, they got moved over. So it was, it was never, it was never adequate. And the same time. And Dan can go back and check the paperwork. When they were talking about the, the bond, they were saying that Roosevelt was never going to make it to 1700 students. They would never even make it to 12 or 1300 students because over on the east side is where they were going to build the additional building with the additional in the, in a future bond, should Roosevelt need to get up to scope and come up to 17, you know, the 1700. And so they were going to build on the east side the, the additional building. And that's when they would also. Because it's, if it ever got there that, you know, they would, you know, figure out a way to do something, possibly figure out a way to do something with the, the bleachers, move the bleachers back. And then it was like, well, it's okay, you've got enough seats. And it was, it was, it just became this dialog of it's okay, you have enough, it's okay, you have enough. And I'm not okay with it. I'm not okay with us telling them, telling the community, telling the Roosevelt community consistently be happy with what you got or you go out and raise the money because we're not telling any other, any other school in our district to do that. No other school, no other school is going to have a trashy Stadium with the exception of Roosevelt. If we go around the district and we look at every other school we within the district that's getting redone, they're all going to have a. A phenomenal stadium, a phenomenal school with the exception of Roosevelt. And we keep telling Roosevelt sit down, be quiet and eat it. And that's not okay. Find the money and let's fix the stadium. I don't see why we're having this discussion. So I don't know how to do it. Like do I say. I mean, is it something that I got to submit? Do I got to submit a resolution? Do I got to write a resolution? Do I got to. Do I got to find three more people to.

confidence: 0.96
E: I'm back. Sorry about that. I was just gonna ask for also and I don't know if this needs to be an amendment but that we also need to ask Bond Council that just clear that it would be an appropriate use of the bond funds or within the scope. My recollection is the language is fairly broad and that this should fit into the overall language that we've included. But we should. We should do that because you need to make sure that you're spending bond if. If that's the funding that would be used that we're using bond funds appropriately also too.

start time: 265:47:50.000
end time: 270:59:04.000
confidence: 0.90
A: I want to ask a question around that. So I wanted cure. I'm curious on how much leftover bonds funds we have from the bonds that I mean in general, how much do we have left over from the savings of whatever bonds that we're going to be using or could use.

start time: 271:01:52.000
end time: 276:11:20.000
confidence: 0.94
B: So the 217 bond program is nearing completion. So all the way down. And so we know we're expecting about 17 million returning from savings from Lincoln High School. That's. That'll be the bulk of it there. There could be some more, but that'll be the bulk of it. 10 million of that has already been.

start time: 285:49:10.000
end time: 291:04:24.000
confidence: 0.93
B: And so that leaves seven from this. This pot of money, for lack of a better term, we expect to have some more, but with the projects, you know, not completed yet, we're not ready to save that. So that's. That's the amount that was noted in the memoir.

start time: 292:45:00.000
end time: 299:42:10.000
confidence: 0.90
E: No, you. I think you captured it correctly. The agreement was 20 million. And there's a dentified process laid out by how it would be spent, but primarily based on school staff. In consultation with school staff. But 10 was from PSA that we already have been granted from the city and 10 from the Bond funds.

We're just laying it over till the next committee meeting. And if, because if we were actually voting on it, then there would be public.

B: Also in the packets is a staff memo. I'll do some quick highlights and begin discussion. As everyone here probably knows, the Grant Bull synthetic turf field is being replaced right now. It'd probably be done if it wasn't for terrible weather for the last week, but very close. And the track is planned to be resurfaced in summer in between spring and fall sports. We're also very close to having a lease agreement with parks that should be coming to the board very soon in the next going to make the next meeting right be the meeting after that. When PPS was considering a new location for the Grant softball field several years ago, the district completed a conceptual master plan that included the upper the upper field where softball is today, as well as the Grant Bowl. That master plan contemplated in the Grant bowl additional improvements such as field lighting, grandstands, concessions, press box storage and perimeter fencing. This is kind of colloquially known as Phase 2. The total estimated amount for that work in $2020 was approximately $11 million. That also included the track and field. So a little bit less take some of that scope out of there. Certainly to meet current ed specs, the Grant bowl, which is obviously the primary track and field for Grant, you know, would need these improvements completed. That said, cutting to the chase very similar to the previous conversation. Considering the district's existing conditions and facility needs, staff recommends that current available funds be allocated to defend facilities and improvements for Grant Phase two be considered along with the improvements for future general obligation bond planning.

G: If you don't know me, I'm Stephanie Antipalf. Probably see me around for Grant stuff. Actually prepared a written statement just so I cover everything, so I'm just going to read it off. I do want to first acknowledge and thank the school district for ensuring that Grant High School football field was replaced and ready for spring sports. This is an important step in getting our student athletes back in our classrooms. While it was an important first step, today I want to address the impact of Phase two. This project isn't prioritized and completed yet. At first I signed up to share my own family's experience with the impact on my son's grades after experiencing my son is experiencing by missing the same class twice a week just to play football this fall. JV and Varsity. Due to my role as the Grant Football Booster President, I also have insight into the larger impact college caused by the missed educational hours. So I'm here as an advocate not only for my family, but for the entire Grant football community. This semester there have been countless athletes who have struggled to gain missed knowledge, retake tests due to missing four plus hours a week on the same class every week completing missed homework, all while keeping their day to day grades afloat. Many of these athletes have struggled so much, including my own son, they have gave up and started to avoid and skip class due to the pressures. Missing this time was not only bad for their grades, it was bad for their mental health. To help paint a picture, I want to share some stats just the football team alone missed over 1000 educational hours this fall. Don't even get me started on how many hours our soccer team missed due to the missing class for practices and games. On average, JV players lost four hours of homework time just for their home games. While they shouldn't have lost any, the average time our varsity players got back to Grant High School from their home games was 10:30 to 11:00pm at night. This impacted a significant amount of our families who work night shifts and had to figure out how to get their kids picked up because public transportation isn't safe at that hour. You might ask me how these stats are still applicable given that the field's fixed. Replacing the field does not improve any of these stats for next year or the years after that. The only thing that will improve the above numbers is if the field gets lights due to how early it sunsets in Portland. Let me be clear. Missing educational hours due to student athletes not being provided proper facilities is unacceptable. This afternoon I was informed the official recommendation recommendation of this committee is to hold on further improvements to the grant goal, including the lights, to ensure that maintenance of the existing facilities is prioritized for the 2017 bond funds. After reading through the various projects, the grant. Sorry, after reading through the various projects, the Grant High School bowl is the only project that directly impacts educational hours. While I agree maintaining maintenance of existing infrastructure is important, these projects do not impact if a student graduates or not missing a significant amount of your high school instructional time does. In a district that has some of the lowest graduation rates in the state, it's essential that the school district show student athletes that their education matters by allocating funds to support projects that directly correlate to their educational hours. Our students deserve better from everyone in this room and it's your time to act now.

D: So I'm Virginia lafort. I'm a Grant high school parent and co founder of the Grant Bowl Community Coalition. As most of you are probably aware, we've been advocating relentlessly and now successfully for Portland Parks and Rec to turn over control of the Grant bowl to PPS so its potential for Grant students and the community can be fully realized under the day to day control of pps. So as the final lease is currently being reviewed by the City of Portland, I'm here today on behalf of the coalition to discuss phase two of advocacy regarding the bowl. It's our understanding this point PPS staff has recommended that further improvements to the bowl be part of future bond planning. Even though Lincoln High School's build out came in $17 million under budget, this funding would be used or the recommendation is that it would be used for urgent deferred maintenance issues at other schools. And I do want to speak personally for a moment. I'm deeply familiar with PPS's deferred maintenance backlog, having initiated advocacy for two multimillion dollar maintenance projects including paint stabilization at all schools and the $38 million air filtration system that's on top of Covenant Schools. So we fully support prioritizing the urgent maintenance needs. There's no question. But what the coalition doesn't support is delaying specifically the installation of the lights at the grand bowl for a minute longer. We're urgently looking for solutions that allow us to address deferred maintenance and, in Grant's case, construction. Deferred construction has been deferred for, let's say, 75 years. Conservative. And we think we have a solution. Most recently, when the upper field was installed next to the grand bowl, the light poles were installed for that upper field, and those poles also are positioned to point directly at the bowl. So, in essence, the project has already been started. And moving forward immediately with the installation of the remaining poles and positioning lights on all of them would extend the hours of the bowl in the immediate future. This will not only allow students to stay on site for practices and address the issues that Stephanie discussed, but it will also extend the available permitting hours for PPS to other community groups. So it's also our understanding that the vendor that did install the polls for the upper field provides financing over 10 years. And with the new lease in place, PPS is actually set to retain the permitting fees for the bowl. We are asking that PPs allocate the revenue from the permitting fees specifically from the bowl for the installation of lights this spring and summer. It's long overdue. We spoke to the architects ourselves months ago to see if installing these poles would screw up any future improvements to the bowl, and it said no. We work about existing things all the time. So, closing, I'd like to say we definitely relate to Director Green's comments of PPs telling the Roosevelt community, you're okay. You have enough. Every other high school has stadiums, but I think we really need to remind everybody that we do not have a stadium at Grant. We do not have any grandstands. We don't have bleachers, we don't have bathrooms, we don't have lights. We don't have a field right now because of everything that's been going on. We sit on the ground when we have one to watch our students, and if it's late, it's in the dark. So all we're asking is in the immediate future finding a solution to address the lights. They're not that expensive. The investment in students and the student community directly impacts their learning. And I also think it's really important that we know that this was a heavy lift getting the turf in track in the lease. And we are so grateful and appreciative to all of you that worked really hard on it, and everyone's really excited every day. When we drive by and we see the turf going in, the fact that it's even going to say Grant on it is a miracle in and of itself. So we really do want to thank all of you and just instill that sense of urgency. We understand that there's planning that has to happen for a bigger build out and it probably, you know, I hate to say it probably will require the bond, but if we can peel off the lights as a separate conversation, we feel that a lot of, you know, immediate damage to students can be mitigated. So that's all.

F: I got a question, Gary, for probably the two of those ladies. They may have more information or even Dan, and this is just a curiosity question and hopefully it's been taken care of. I know that back when they were originally talking about it, some of the Grant community had talked about they didn't want lights or they were going to sue. They were going to like they were going to be suing. And then I believe that went away. Like that's no longer an issue. But has that been confirmed that that's no longer an issue? Because I think that was something that it came up because everybody was like, no, no, no, we don't want these lights. They're going to be pointing at our house. And then something was done that said we could. They would be directional. So I just want to know if that was resolved for sure.

And we had over a Thousand responses and it was like, like 90. Over 95% of the community supported the installation of lights. It's a real, there's a real groundswell of support right now and everybody's actually really excited about it. People love the bulb, they want to use it and they want to use it especially, you know, during it's, there's, there is no time that they don't want to use it between games and after school summer. It's, it's a no brainer.

E: Well, first I want to say, I want to just thank the staff. I know they got into a hurry up offense to get the field installed. I really appreciate that. A lot of people said it couldn't be done, but you've done it. So thank you also for, for the many hours negotiating with the city to get us very close, hopefully to vote soon on a lease agreement. So I want to start with that. I know it was one of those things that kind of dropped in your lap and you have really delivered in a timely way. I wanted to ask a question. If I was looking through the summary of the staff memoir and I didn't see. What I'm looking at is a cost estimate for phase two that has all the ijump shot put, javelin facility, field lighting, grandstand seating up to 1500 with a price tag of 11 million. And I'm wondering since the ask was for the media to ask was for the lights have, is there a separate cost estimate to activate the lights?

start time: 588:43:00.000
end time: 590:27:20.000
confidence: 0.90
B: Yeah, I don't. But Virginia is saying yes, I don't know offhand, so her call might be better. We'd have to take a look.

start time: 590:55:00.000
end time: 596:05:30.000
confidence: 0.97
D: There's a line and a breakdown of that $11 million and obviously it's a couple, it's a couple years old at this point, but I feel like the number was 400,000 for the lights at the time and they're already partially in. So it's not, you know, not saying that's not a lot of money, but it's not, you know, millions and millions of dollars to, to get those lights in.

start time: 596:19:50.000
end time: 597:21:18.000
confidence: 0.91
E: So I, I'd like to ask estimate.

start time: 597:22:54.000
end time: 609:39:30.000
confidence: 0.95
D: Because I think they're going to be. Obviously the lights themselves are a cost, but then there's, there's, there's all the other stuff that kind of goes on top of that. That's part of the project and I think it'd be valuable for us to, to do our research and really Understand while the poles themselves are multi directional, we want to make sure that the lighting pattern is appropriate for the field because it's really important that we have the light set up in certain ways to ensure athletes safety so that there's not shadow areas and things like that. So that lighting design piece is actually. It's fairly important. So I think there's probably a little more work to be done. It's certainly worth it.

start time: 609:56:30.000
end time: 628:53:20.000
confidence: 0.96
E: Director Hollins, could I ask staff or a to come back at the next meeting with a refined estimate. I appreciate Marina the issues you're raising and it would be good also because we got just a very large number which is not what the ask is. It would be good to understand exactly what the size of the ask is. So if we could have that at the next meeting. Chair Hollins, I appreciate if we could. We could get that. The other question I had just. This is a more general question and Dan, I think you would know this. In our agreement with Parks when they. When the field is used by people who pay fees, who gets that money or is that not the model anymore?

start time: 629:09:40.000
end time: 631:06:40.000
confidence: 0.84
B: The draft lease agreement is that PPS controls all permitting and receives all fees.

start time: 631:50:10.000
end time: 637:36:30.000
confidence: 0.95
E: And for is that the case for our other fields that in any time we there's permitting. It's not that Parks now is doing the per. I know like with our gyms that there's a different arrangement but if we're doing. If we're doing the pit meeting the permitting fees also come to us. And I'm curious where that money goes.

start time: 638:02:20.000
end time: 639:01:56.000
confidence: 0.79
B: What I'll let. I'll let Dan know why they sure.

start time: 639:04:28.000
end time: 665:00:10.000
confidence: 0.96
E: It goes to the general fund. The idea is that it helps support the money that goes back into maintenance for buildings. So just for what it's worth, when we set up the 10 Fields project which was the first when all the fields except for all the fields and all the tracks with the exception of Benson were redone in a partnership with Nike, the city and others that the thought was those fees would be partially also part of the ongoing sustaining the athletic facilities. And I'm so it sounds like maybe that practice has changed but it seems like again this sort of marrying if we. If we have assets that are generating revenue, you know to keep them that revenue in the cycle of either upgrading or addressing maintenance issues for the facilities seems like in a separate account. So the way that the accounting works it just goes in to the general fund. And you may remember we rents also go in there. So sort of all that revenue from buildings or operations that we house the buildings. That was $2 million a year until just this year. And I think the district is committed to keeping it at at least a million dollars because. And. And that's because of.

B: CUB revenue goes into a capital fund. And if I recall the memo correctly, the memo calls out capital fund or does. Goes into one of the. There's a handful of different capital funds, non bond capital funds. Some are restricted, some are not. This goes into a capital fund, but as the memo calls out like the overall, the grouping of the capital funds, as Dan has mentioned, those revenue amount, annual revenues have been dropping over the last number of years. So to answer your question, it goes back to the general fund.

start time: 687:26:04.000
end time: 687:30:44.000

E: Correct.

start time: 687:31:32.000
end time: 689:37:20.000

confidence: 0.96
E: So that's cub. So that would. That would be everything from somebody renting, you know, a classroom or the library and to using the fields. It would be great to get that broken out just in terms of like effective use of our assets. I know originally when the fields were turfed and everything else, obviously the first use and highest use was to be for the school communities. But if there were revenues that was designed to be like, some of that should be coming back into, like, for the field refreshes and everything else. If I may, if you look at the balance for 2023 and 2024, it's almost a million. So a million will not go very far at all. I mean, if we were to restrict.

For when we were doing the research on the bowl, when we were doing the lease research, we did a public records request to find out how much the Grant bowl itself generated in revenue over 10 years. And it was over $300,000, which, over the course of 10 years, you know, it's not a ton, but it was definitely. I think the park said it was the most heavily used asset, so that there is definitely room for revenue potential there. Like, in terms of, like, talking about the cost of lights and the revenue in it feels like it would definitely be a significant chunk of it if there was some sort of exception made for. It's kind of a unique facility.

You think you'll be able to have that by the end of. By the next meeting, or do you need more time than that? How Detailed.

C: Okay, we'll get started with Cleveland. So we started our comprehensive. This slide shows the number of meetings that we have and what the topic is of those meetings as far as introducing the process, creating vision and goals, talking about our ed Spec program for comprehensive high schools, and then getting into site analysis and options to consider for the modernization. Just one slight change to this. Our meeting last week on the 18th was rescheduled to tomorrow, so that hasn't occurred yet. As far as our meeting number four. But that's where we will be bringing some refined site options to the committee for their review and feedback, as we are ultimately working toward a single option that we can recommend for approval. In addition, we've met with CHS staff and presented the same materials we're taking to the committee, to the staff, as well as to community design workshops, which we had one in December and then again our one for last week, which was canceled for the ice, will be happening in a couple weeks and getting some more community involvement and participation.

start time: 824:54:10.000

A: Good question. How was the. From the first community workshop, how did it go?

start time: 826:22:10.000
end time: 865:42:40.000
confidence: 0.95
C: The first workshop was great. We had over 60 people from the community attendees. And so a broad range from families with young students, from theater schools to Cleveland alumni and parents. And in fact, as a side note, I'm a Cleveland High school graduate, and so I saw some parents of people. I went to high school with there were really interested in the process. So great crowd, cross section of the community. So in moving forward, you know, I mentioned the progress to date as far as our community engagement process. That's really kind of defining the schedule that we're working with our architecture and engineering team to develop the planning next steps. You know, we're defining, refining the design options, as I mentioned, and having additional meetings and workshops to get through that effort. You know, the opportunities that we've had is really to increase our community involvement with reaching out to historically underserved communities to get their input as well. We're starting listening sessions that will be bringing in those community groups in addition to our committee work and workshop work. We do have some challenges, of course, with Cleveland. It's a very constrained site as far far as just where the main building is across from the existing parking lot. So that just presents some challenges with the planning and design efforts. There is also a decision that needs to be made on whether or not we would keep or demolish the 1929 structure. It has a historic designation which is at the sort of lowest significance of historic value according to the state. So it's not a landmark, but there's still implications either keeping it or not keeping it with the site design. And so we're continuing to get feedback from the community on that. And then, you know, another challenge is improving student safety on Powell and 26th Avenue there. As we know that that's been a community concern for some time. And that's one of the things that we're tackling with the project team as well.

start time: 866:05:00.000
end time: 867:59:20.000
confidence: 0.93
A: I'm just curious so far with the community, what are their thoughts around tearing it down versus keeping the structure?

start time: 868:11:40.000
end time: 878:45:30.000
confidence: 0.96
C: Well, there's kind of similar to the initial mass conceptual planning effort that was done pre pandemic that there's kind of a split in the community. There are some folks that, that, you know, like the old building and want to keep the historic part. There are other members of the community and the school community that would rather see new construction and have more flexibility and perhaps efficiency with. With a newer new building. So that's. So yeah, we're seeing kind of a split with that and hoping to get sort of closer to a decision recommendation that we can make.

start time: 878:53:20.000
end time: 880:59:00.000
confidence: 0.95
A: I'm going to just say I think our new high school spec should be brand new schools. Just put that out there.

start time: 881:42:40.000
end time: 881:57:44.000

C: Duly noted.

F: I'm with it.

start time: 883:24:00.000
end time: 906:12:50.000
confidence: 0.96
C: And this is just kind of a massing model, just looking at the two different options that keep the historic structure and build new structure. Around it. There's another option that looks at putting some of the school program on the existing parking lot across the street, which adds a little bit more complexity and requires skybridge to create safer crossing across 26th Avenue. And we're, we're kind of bringing that back to feedback tomorrow night to get some input from the committee. And then this is kind of a massing diagram of those two different ideas as far as using one site or two sites. But this is all new construction and this is where the, you know, the old building is demolished. And again looking at either using the one sort of four plus acres that we have as one site or expanding across the street onto the parking lot. And as you can imagine, expanding across the street on the parking lot. That option does have a higher cost and some additional trade offs that we'll be getting feedback from on from the committee and at the workshop. That's it for my update, but happy to answer any questions.

start time: 909:56:38.000
end time: 940:03:00.000
confidence: 0.94
E: Okay, great. First I just thought I'd also give a shout out. I was at the community forum. It was really well attended by a pretty broad cross section. Also staff was there although I know they have their own process. So it was great to see a really strong turnout. Sort of multi generational is as Eric mentioned and I appreciate the attention to whether or not the building, whichever model, the direction you head in that there's an attention to the personal. The safety of students with my daughter went to Cleveland and that whole 26th Powell is just sort of a nightmare. Watching students outside the school pretty much all day whether, whether it's before school, during lunchtime or after school. So I really appreciate that attention to safety in addition to the structure and what's happening inside the building. A question I had about sort of the timeline I know last year because Cleveland has been in the been in the queue since the 2011 bond that didn't pass. And then somehow they got back to the back end that the last bond allocated funds for all this planning and design work. And the saying at the time was it's going to be shovel ready when the next bond, you know, the plans will be shovel ready when the next bond passes. And I'm curious whether that's the case or there's some, there's some thing between this work and the bond passage.

start time: 940:59:20.000
end time: 950:41:40.000
confidence: 0.96
C: So after the comprehensive plan effort is completed and then of course submitted to the board for approval, you know, there's funding in the current Bond in the 2020 bond for design and Planning so the design effort can continue. And but we have yet to, you know, approved our architect team to continue design and we're waiting on proposals for that work. But you know, right now with the comprehensive planning effort, we're looking at the, you know, April board meeting as our target to bring that for approval. And then design would continue.

start time: 951:10:40.000
end time: 956:31:10.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And then it would continue. And in theory, if, if there were another bond and it passed, the project would be ready to move ahead versus having that kind of longer planning period that happened in 27, 2017.

start time: 957:17:30.000
end time: 961:18:40.000
confidence: 0.92
B: I think I understand your question is that after the comprehensive plan that's approved in say April, we will then move into schematic design bond passes. We will, it will continue design. It'll be seamless.

start time: 961:43:00.000
end time: 972:51:40.000
confidence: 0.93
E: Okay, I guess maybe like let me ask a slightly different way. So in the 20, the 2012 and the 2017 bonds is like the, the bond the bonds passed and then really that incentive work happened. Not, not with Lincoln, but in this case there was an intentionality since they were the last two high schools to front load it and to provide some resources before the actual bond where the whole modernization costs were included. Will we have speeded up the process.

start time: 973:55:20.000
end time: 981:15:10.000
confidence: 0.92
B: If both wells and Cleveland in November 24th will be in design and it'll be preparing for submitting building permits. Land use will be in there somewhere. So yes, it would be fast. It'll be faster from the time of bond passage to, to, you know, into design and into construction.

start time: 981:39:30.000
end time: 996:23:20.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And then my final question is, and I'm probably going to keep asking this, so sorry Eric and Dan, if you've heard it before, but just in light of both Benson and Jefferson, where whether it was design or something site specific, where the ultimately the project costs were appearing that they were going to be greater than what had been the funds allocated in the bond, what sort of work are we doing now? We done would be done between now and frankly when in November 2024 to try and get a really accurate estimate of what the project cost would be so that you have that understanding in the bond of what the cost might actually.

start time: 997:23:10.000
end time: 1012:30:30.000
confidence: 0.94
C: Well currently our efforts. I mean one of the advantages I guess of being later in the whole high school modernization plan is that we have then our previously created projects that we can utilize that data. And so we have now real cost data from Lincoln and real cost data from Benson and better cost data from Jefferson so that we're looking at that as a broad scale to make sure that our budgets that we're developing for wells in Cleveland are as well aligned to what we anticipate cost to be. And then of course, you know, having cost consultant professionals, you know, providing their cost models to us in that process. But you're right, there have been issues with budgets. We're doing our best to not have that happen.

start time: 1013:24:50.000
end time: 1022:08:36.000
confidence: 0.86
A: Thank you. Thanks. We're going to move over to Ida B. Wells. Okay.

start time: 1022:09:08.000
end time: 1054:38:02.000
confidence: 0.96
H: Ida B. Wells. We've been on a very similar schedule as Cleveland with our outreach. All of our community engagement has been almost right in line and in step with theirs. We started in October with the planning committee meetings. We just had our most recent one on Monday this week on the 22nd that was rescheduled because of the ice. And then our community design workshops have been going along the same as Cleveland's. Our next workshop will be February 3rd, which is a Saturday, if you'd like to invite anybody to attend that. And then we've had stakeholder interviews with the same engagement consultant that Cleveland is using, and those have been ongoing, some one on one and small group interviews with students, staff and so on. We've collected a lot of great information and feedback, have some really wonderful, interested community members that have brought just amazing, amazing input for us. Quickly, an existing site plan here to show the major elements. And on the right or the east side is the existing school footprint, which the building would be built somewhere on the site, as you will see in the next slides, and then the existing school will be demolished. So we have narrowed it down to two schemes. The first scheme shows the buildable area here on the south in the orange block. And then we would be, like I said, moving after the building is demolished on the east, then we'd be replacing those fields. And so in this case the baseball field moves. And in both of our schemes the pool remains where it is because the pool is, is not ours, it's not PPS's pool. It is important parking with that pool. So in this scheme, the track and field stays in the same location and.

start time: 1054:38:26.000
end time: 1055:39:16.000
confidence: 0.77
A: In the next is the track ours or the park and park and Rec?

start time: 1055:41:48.000
end time: 1095:28:40.000
confidence: 0.96
H: The track and field is ours, yes. Yes. So the property is ours. But Portland park and Rec built the pools in 1956. They were renovated in 2004, and they manage and pay for the pool use. So that's how that works. And in this scheme, we've reoriented the track and field to what we know is a better orientation for trucks and fields for sun exposure. But also this does give some other advantages to how the building lays out. And it makes for a more welcoming approach from Capitol highway, where the city buses And a lot of people arrive from that side of campus. But there's also a lot of people that arrive from the south side from Vermont Street. So the blue arrows represent pedestrian access. The red dashed line represents southwest trails. City of Portland that will be maintained and actually improved. And in this case you can see where the baseball field and multi use field would then be rebuilt new on the east side. And in summary, these plans are a little bit smaller, but they get a little bit more detailed. For both schemes we're keeping the pool, as I mentioned. The big difference here is that that track and field gets reoriented on scheme two. In both schemes there's brand new tennis courts in the lower right on the southeast corner of the property. Both schemes would have new baseball fields and multi use field and the softball field that's over by Reiki Elementary School. That would be improved in both of these schemes. And it is possible that we can take all the input that we've been gathering and that it wouldn't be exactly like this, but we'd come up with one plan that we go forward with that just takes the best elements of everything. So in the original plans we had three completely different plans. We took the best of each and came out with these two. And now we'll narrow this down, down to one to go forward with to the board in April. And that's the end of my slides. But I can certainly show more or answer any Questions.

start time: 1097:19:40.000
end time: 1102:30:54.000
confidence: 0.93
A: On Scheme 2. I'm looking at the track. So with that I'm a track guy. So will that have enough space for like the discus, the shot put javelin. And is the javelin going to be going on the field? Is that a turf field or grass.

start time: 1102:31:42.000
end time: 1114:35:34.000
confidence: 0.95
H: Field is a turf field and it would be all the typical things that you mentioned. In addition, the layout here works well because the topography of this site is higher to the east or to the right and it drops down to the left to the west. So we would take advantage of that topography. Topography. And that grandstand would sit essentially in the hillside there, here between the building to the track and field. We also would be planning, from what we've heard, to make sure that there's plenty of other spaces here for queuing up crowds and setting up track teams and things like that. So while this isn't as detailed, we do have. We've just started to go into some more detailed drawings.

start time: 1114:38:02.000
end time: 1118:19:30.000

E: This is just a question about the. For both the schools. Just in light of the conversation earlier, what type of stadium is being put in for both of these schools? I think currently. I think they both have. Just visiting or I'm home. Grandstands are not something on the other side. Currently there's something on the other side.

start time: 1148:10:38.000
end time: 1152:42:30.000
confidence: 0.97
H: Small visitor stands on the south end right here and a concrete grandstand structure here which is still being studied to determine if we might be able to just renovate that or if it should be replaced. So all of that is still under study.

start time: 1153:22:10.000
end time: 1159:28:39.000
confidence: 0.94
E: And Cleveland I think has. It's a super lame visitors. I think it's like just a temporary rollout one. Is that going to be modified or is there. I guess maybe my bigger question is is there an ED spec around what we do on the stadiums?

start time: 1159:54:19.000
end time: 1172:56:00.000
confidence: 0.93
C: Well, the, the ED spec is not very detailed regarding the stadiums. It does call for stadium seating. And you know, that's something that we'll get into more detail when we're getting into schematic design about what can work within the site plan that that moves forward. And there's certainly a difference between existing grants that stands, say at Wells versus new grandstands. The actual. The grandstands at Cleveland are somewhat newer and that was a community effort to build those. But you're right, the visitor stands are Just kind of some little dinky stance on the other side of the field. But we're. We'll be in, you know, additional conversations with athletics about that as we move forward.

start time: 1173:30:30.000
end time: 1184:52:40.000
confidence: 0.95
E: I'm just thinking question as well. Yeah, so I'm just. I'm just say. I just listening to all the conversations and I know that every school community has their own thing that they don't have that everybody else has. And as our aspect have evolved is just getting some sort of standardization. I think would. And I know each site is unique, but it would help with people feeling that there's equity of like. Like the basics that we do at every school and the. The outside environment within the custom and the footprint of the. The actual site.

F: Yeah, just. Just a note. I didn't. Because I'm not seeing the entire thing. But when. When we start thinking about athletics, the, the gyms, like, so when they're. They're. Most of our schools are now getting at least two gyms. The. The main gym that has several. You're able to do two gyms and the main gym plus an auxiliary gym. And we're doing that so that we can go back to having two games, you know, like playing at one time. The problem that we had that we ran into at Roosevelt is that in order to. To have two full games and it. It be a official game, you have to have proper seating for at least. And I and Dan may know, but you have to have seating for at least 100 people and a score. A score. A score table. And so without it being on the floor and because of the. Because we moved Roosevelt's gym in that wall in, I believe it was what, 25ft? Dan, it's 25ft.

F: 25Ft shorter than what it should have been. We weren't able to get the. The specs right when it came to the. Came to the gym. And therefore their bleachers can't come all the way out without being in the actual floor. They can only come partway out and they don't have adequate seating on the. In the auxiliary gym. And you can't. I mean, all they. They may have a clock, but you can't. You can't put a table, a score table out there without it impeding up on the floor. So as we start looking at our other schools, I think we want to keep that kind of stuff in mind. We also want to think about if they've got a wrestling team are we. Making sure that the community understands that if there's going to be shared space situations where in Roosevelt's case, the wrestling team puts their mat on the. On the gym floor and it takes up space so that the. The basketball players can't. Can't do what they need to do because the, the wrestling mat is there. And we also have the baseball team that hits balls in the auxiliary gym because. So I just think we need to be thinking, making sure that even if those communities are saying, no, we don't care about those things, that we're at least putting those things out there as things that they need to be aware of, because they do come up when you start thinking about competition sports. So I was just highly involved with Roosevelt. I'm not as involved with some of these other schools. So I know all the shortcomings and where all the bones are buried at Roosevelt.

A: Let's go. Well, it's just, yeah, we need at least some. Some kind of COVID for, you know, on one of the schools or something. I mean, we can figure out, you know, we'll figure out something, but it'll be nice to have some covers, space place when you got football games, track meets, and, you know, Oregon, you know, it's raining and it's just. It just makes it for a better experience if our kids could have something that's covered at least partially so they can have an enjoyable experience. And with that, well, also just.

E: I'm just gonna like, join in because you can't just say that, throw that out there because for 15 years I sat in the rain and watched my kids place sports in the pil. And like, it really makes it hard for a lot of people, like, you know, grandparents and everybody else to come out and sit in the. It's it in the rain. Because, like, frankly, the outdoor seasons usually are raining.
